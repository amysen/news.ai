The cross-party commission, comprising 40 parliamentarians, was set up to look into the scandals and crises that have rocked Italian banks in recent years.

“Only the commission as a whole will be able to make a final judgment, but indications of improper behavior have certainly been found,” Casini said in the interview published on Sunday.

Casini said the initial findings pointed to a “network of complicity” that resulted in offers of employment and consultancy jobs.

“It’s certainly not a good thing seeing Bank of Italy directors quickly take up top positions at the banks that were the target of inquiries,” Casini said. “If this had happened to a politician, it would certainly have triggered a chorus of deserved criticism.”

The cross-party commission has the same investigative powers as the magistrature, although it has little to reach conclusions before the legislature ends. The role of the Bank of Italy and market watchdog Consob, which share supervision of the sector, is expected to come under scrutiny.

The government has had to spend more than 20 billion euros ($23.22 billion) this year to prop up the sector, injecting 5.4 billion euros to salvage Italy’s fourth-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), and offering billions of euros in guarantees as it wound down two major banks in the Veneto region.

Four other, smaller banks were wound down in 2015, hitting thousands of small savers.

Critics have accused both the Bank of Italy and Consob of failing in their oversight duties - allegations both bodies have rejected.

Casini said, however, that the initial findings also showed how many of the judiciary investigations had been triggered by inspections launched by the Bank of Italy itself.

“It’s a mix bag of positives and negatives. We need to understand which had dominated,” he said.

Asked about a risk that the inquiry could serve only as electoral propaganda before a forthcoming election, Casini said he had voiced the same concerns when the commission was set up but now would seek to guarantee that it does not become “political battleground”.

Andrew Cuomo of New York and Jerry Brown of California spoke in a joint conference call a day after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure that advanced President Donald Trump’s tax plan.

Republican leaders have sketched out an outline of the tax measures that would eliminate the tax break, although detailed legislation will not be unveiled until next Wednesday.

If the SALT deduction were eliminated the tax package would disproportionately hit residents of states that have high income taxes, many of which are historically Democratic, the governors said.

“This is an attack on California, New York and New Jersey, and other states that would not vote for Trump,” Brown said. “It’s a gross manipulation of our tax code.”

The SALT deduction allows residents to subtract income taxes paid to states and local governments from the total income taxed by the federal government taxes. Its elimination would be one among a series of measures to offset lost revenues from what are envisaged as sweeping overall cuts on corporate and personal taxes.

While analysts say the overall tax package would cut taxes for companies and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, many residents of high-tax states who use the deduction would pay more, the governors said.

In New York, taxpayers would pay an average of an additional $5,300 in federal income taxes a year without the SALT deduction, Cuomo’s office said in a separate statement.

That sharp increase in taxes would likely lead to an exodus of residents, starting with high earners, who would see the greatest increases, Cuomo said. “Higher-income people will move,” he said.

Some Republican lawmakers from high-tax states voted against the budget measure on Thursday to express opposition to the elimination of the SALT deduction. Republican congressional leaders are working to allay their concerns.

“If the SALT is repealed, we would expect some deterioration of credit quality for affected states and localities in the medium term, including some price pressure on housing markets in areas bordering states with lower local taxes (eg, southern New Jersey),” Barclays analysts wrote to clients on Thursday.

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

SLIGHT UNIONIST LEAD

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Slideshow (4 Images)

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia-poll/hundreds-of-thousands-march-for-unified-spain-poll-shows-depths-of-division-idINKBN1CY06U

With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement’s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament.

Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one.

The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom.

Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust.

The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s use of offshore tax havens.

In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world’s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability.

After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties.

The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament’s 63 seats.

“The opposition has a majority, so that’s a message. But we’ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,” Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday.

The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.

The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament.

The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year’s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland’s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters.

Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said: ”I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it’s normal that we should be a part of a future government.

“We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,” he said. “We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.”

His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.

The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year’s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.

“I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,” said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government.

The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes.

The company’s shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.

Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.

“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.

“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”

The company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades.

Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday. The base price for the phone is $999.

President Muhammadu Buhari has, since taking office in 2015, sought help from several nations to recover money he said was taken from public coffers.

It is not immediately clear who deposited the money in Britain. The money was frozen at the request of prosecutors as a result of an Italian investigation. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by British authorities.

The investigations into the $1.3 billion sale in 2011 of oil prospecting licence (OPL) 245, which could hold more than 9 billion barrels of oil, have involved Italian, Nigerian and Dutch authorities and two of the world’s largest international oil companies.

It was initially awarded in 1998 to Malabu Oil and Gas before Royal Dutch Shell and Eni were awarded the rights in 2011 for $1.3 billion.

Shell has said it was aware that some of the payments it made to Nigeria for rights to the oilfield would go to Malabu, a company associated with former Nigerian oil minister and convicted money launderer Dan Etete.

“Nigeria had recently recovered the sum of $85 million from the controversial Malabu Restrained Funds from United Kingdom,” said the office of the attorney general, Abubakar Malam, in a statement late on Thursday based on his remarks at an asset recovery event in the capital, Abuja.

The money is part of funds related to OPL 245 payments that have been frozen in bank accounts around the world.

In the same statement, the attorney general’s office said negotiations with Switzerland on the repatriation of $321 million stolen by former military leader Sani Abacha had concluded.

He said a memorandum of understanding would be signed in early December and repatriation of the funds would follow a few weeks later.

Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, has accused Abacha of stealing up to $5 billion of public money during the five years he ran the oil-rich country, from 1993 until he died in 1998.",Nigeria recovers $85 mln deposited in Britain in oil licence deal funds - attorney general,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1CW1VM-OZABS

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, under fire in recent days over conflict-of-interest allegations, pointed to stronger-than-expected economic growth as proof the Liberal strategy of deficit spending had paid dividends in the two years since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a surprise majority.

“So now, with a little more wind in our sails, we’re doubling down on a plan with proven results and reinvesting in the middle class,” Morneau said in a speech to parliament.

The government has been badly shaken by charges that Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell (MSI.TO), was in a conflict of interest because he did not place his holdings in a blind trust, but hopes the fiscal update will reset pubic focus on the strong economy.

The deficit was projected to shrink to C$19.9 billion this year from C$28.5 billion projected in the March budget, but the improvement included a reduction in the government’s so-called fiscal cushion to C$1.5 billion from C$3 billion in March.

The budget shortfall was forecast to shrink further, to C$18.6 billion next year and to C$12.5 billion by the end of the budget’s five-year horizon in 2022-23. Each of those years included a C$3 billion fiscal cushion, a risk adjustment that economists consider prudent.

Morneau’s update had little impact on financial markets, but the additional stimulus may give the Bank of Canada more room to continue to hike interest rates, though no move is expected at the bank’s next policy decision on Wednesday.

“You kind of have a hand off from monetary policy to the federal government by way of fiscal stimulus,” said Scott Smith, managing partner at Viewpoint Investment Partners. “If you can thread the needle, then it’s a great strategy ... the challenge comes if there’s a hiccup in any link of the chain as it pertains to either monetary or fiscal policy.”

Morneau said the government would strengthen the child benefit by indexing it to inflation from next July, a pledge that will cost C$5.6 billion over five years, and increase the tax benefit for low-income workers.

He forecast GDP growth to slow to 2.1 percent in 2018 and 1.6 percent in 2019, from 3.1 percent this year.

Together with the smaller deficits, the growth would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 30.5 percent this year from 31.2 in 2016-2017 and gradually to 28.5 percent by 2022-23, better than most G7 rivals.","Canada to unveil smaller budget deficit, hopes will shift focus",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CT2WG-OCADN

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

SLIGHT UNIONIST LEAD

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia-poll/catalan-independence-parties-seen-losing-parliamentary-majority-in-election-poll-idUKKBN1CY06S

Despite deep capital spending cuts and a refocusing on projects that can generate faster paybacks in recent years, the results on Friday showed the pair, neither of whom hedge oil output, are still at the mercy of price gyrations.

Exxon and Chevron have pointed to aggressive plans for boosting low-cost U.S. shale production. But in recent quarters total output at both has atrophied and shale is unlikely to deliver a marked lift until the next decade, based on corporate projections.

“Both are trying to be disciplined and show growth,” said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst with Edward Jones. “But it’s a little bit of a transition, especially as they’re trying to increase shale (output).”

The pair reported the same day as French rival Total SA posted a 29 percent jump in its third-quarter net profit as project ramp-ups and new investments lifted production.

Exxon, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly, said its Permian oil production will grow 45 percent each year through 2020, to more than 400,000 barrels per day. The company also has a large shale position in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation.

Still, Exxon said higher prices contributed $860 million to its earnings while volume increases added only $20 million to the latest quarter’s exploration profit. Exxon’s total output in the quarter was the lowest this year.

Also on Friday Exxon, part of a consortium with Norway’s Statoil and Portugal’s Petrogal, a unit of Galp Energia, won one of four blocks in Brazil’s coveted pre-salt oil region in an auction.

Exxon stock edged up 0.1 percent to $83.53 on Friday afternoon.

At Chevron, a writedown of its Bangladesh operations and a drop in U.S. production weighed on results, which missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin.

Chevron’s stock slid 4.5 percent to $113.15, a drop that surprised Chief Executive Officer John Watson, he said during an investors conference call.

The San Ramon, California, company, which has been one of the Permian’s largest acreage holders since the 1930s, has only recently begun to aggressively develop its oil reserves there. Watson told Reuters earlier this year the Permian is “very important” in the company’s portfolio.

While the company has yet to forecast 2018 production goals for the Permian, Watson said on Friday that Chevron will grow aggressively in the region.

Chevron’s overall average daily output was up 8 percent over a year ago, but that was largely due to the start of giant natural-gas projects. U.S. oil production at Chevron fell overall, as aging field output offset a jump in Permian production.

WIE GEHT ES WEITER?

Der Druck auf Kengeter war zuletzt massiv gestiegen: Die Staatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt hatte erst Anfang der Woche die Ermittlungen gegen ihn wieder aufgenommen, nachdem zuvor ein Deal mit der Justiz am Widerspruch des zuständigen Gerichts gescheitert war. Sowohl im Aufsichtsrat als auch bei großen Aktionären der Börse hatten sich zuletzt die Stimmen gemehrt, die eine Ablösung Kengeters forderten. Der durch die Affäre enstandene Imageschaden für die Börse sei zu groß.

Kengeter wird vorgeworfen, er habe Aktien der Deutschen Börse erworben, um von Kursgewinnen zu profitieren - als er bereits plante, die Londoner Börse LSE zu übernehmen. Dieses Vorhaben war später gescheitert. Kengeter beteuert bis heute seine Unschuld. Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Faber, der das umstrittene Aktienoptionsprogramm auf den Weg brachte, hatte sich lange hinter Kengeter gestellt. Allerdings war der Druck zuletzt auch auf Faber gestiegen - intern wie extern.

Der Deal mit der Staatsanwaltschaft sah die Einstellung des Verfahrens gegen eine Zahlung von 500.000 Euro durch Kengeter vor. Das Amtsgericht Frankfurt durchkreuzte die Pläne. Insider hatten daraufhin die Chanchen auf eine Verlängerung des Ende März 2018 auslaufenden Vertrages für den Manager als mehr oder weniger gleich null bezeichnet.

Doch selbst wenn der Deal geklappt hätte, wäre Kengeter noch nicht vom Haken gewesen.

With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement’s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament.

Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one.

The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom.

Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust.

The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s use of offshore tax havens.

In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world’s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability.

After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties.

The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament’s 63 seats.

“The opposition has a majority, so that’s a message. But we’ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,” Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday.

The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.

The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament.

The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year’s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland’s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters.

Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said: ”I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it’s normal that we should be a part of a future government.

“We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,” he said. “We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.”

His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.

The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year’s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.

The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes.

The report in the Sun newspaper follows dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein which have prompted hundreds of thousands of women around the world to share their own experiences.

The Sun said on Friday that female staff working in London’s Westminster political district had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators.

It did not name anyone in connection with allegations but cited unnamed members of the group when describing its contents and purpose.

“The reports are very concerning, but I can’t pre-empt allegations or investigations that haven’t come to light yet,” May’s spokeswoman said when asked about the Sun story.

“The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics.”

Separately, a group of women members of Britain’s opposition Labour Party have set up a website calling on fellow members who have experienced sexual harassment within party ranks to tell their stories anonymously to try and improve Labour’s culture.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Friday ordered a 24-hour suspension of military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq. The two sides held a first round of talks on Friday and Saturday .

Abadi said the talks are meant to prepare for the peaceful deployment of Iraqi troops at the border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria in Iraq’s Kurdistan region.

Clashes broke out between the two sides after Iraqi forces captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk from the Peshmerga, in a surprise offensive ordered by Abadi after the Kurds held an independence referendum in northern Iraq on Sept. 25.

Kirkuk is part of so-called disputed areas, claimed by both the Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq.

“The second round of talks about deploying federal troops in the disputed areas has started,” State TV said, giving no further details.

Abadi wants to take control of the disputed areas and the border crossings, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.

The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution” - a call rejected by Baghdad.

U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country.

The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG’s official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16. But the Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region.

The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by KRG President Masoud Barzani, since it halved the region’s oil export revenue.

The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur and south of their capital, Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides.

Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he was “disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution” and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG “overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution”.

Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,” he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.","Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga start new round of talks, Iraqi State TV says",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-talks/iraqi-forces-kurdish-peshmerga-start-new-round-of-talks-iraqi-state-tv-says-idUSKBN1CY0GF?il=0

The Nifty climbed 1.7 percent, although the gains were much higher for the Sensex - up 2.4 percent for the week. Both mid-cap and small-cap indexes underperformed in terms of percentage gains. The banking index stole the show by registering sharp gains.

FIIs were active buyers during the week, pumping in 73 billion rupees ($1.12 billion), with Wednesday alone accounting for 68 billion rupees ($1.05 billion). On the currency front, as the dollar has been gaining strength against euro and yen, sooner or later we may see the rupee coming under selling pressure. In the short term, the rupee has seen strong accumulation between 64.80 -65 against the dollar and we may see it inching towards 66 in the coming weeks.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced a mega bank recapitalisation plan of 2.11 trillion rupees ($32.4 billion) for state-run banks, which is expected to help support a recovery and pick-up in private investments. In fact, the capital injection target of this quantum is higher than the total infusion in more than a decade. Larger state-run banks such as SBI and Punjab National Bank were on a roll, appreciating between 20-50 percent within two days of the announcement.

The government expects that the fiscal deficit target of 3.2 percent of GDP for the year will be not breached despite the recapitalisation move. One may recollect that an earlier infusion of 700 billion rupees ($10.7 billion) was touted by experts as insufficient to meet capital requirements. The current round of infusion is expected to be adequate to cover Basel III requirements and support credit offtake. Though the announcement had the desired impact on markets, it is very important that implementation is done in a timely manner. If the recap is not followed by banking sector reforms, we could have a repeat of the same non-performing asset (NPA) issues.

Shares of road construction companies gained after the Cabinet approved the country’s 7 trillion rupee ($107 billion) road construction plan, including the ambitious Bharatmala. The huge spending is expected to give a fillip to private sector investments according to the finance minister. The Bharatmala Pariyojana is a 5.35 trillion rupee ($82 billion) investment to construct 34,800 km of roads. This along with the bank recap announcement is the government’s biggest decision just before the assembly polls in the states of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.

Earnings declared during the week were a mixed bag. Ambuja Cement, Asian Paints, Maruti Suzuki, HUL and Zee Entertainment exceeded expectations. HDFC Bank, ITC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Infosys met market expectations with HDFC Bank reporting stable asset quality.

Infosys cut its FY18 revenue guidance and now expects a 5.5-6.5 percent revenue growth for FY18 in constant currency terms. This is apparently Infy’s slowest projection in a decade as its main segments such financial services and retail scaled back on outsourcing work.

Frontliners that missed market expectations were Yes Bank, IOC, Biocon and ICICI Bank. ITC said that two of its business segments namely cigarettes and consumer goods remained under pressure. The company saw an overall contraction in its margins and demand remains sluggish after Goods and Services Tax (GST).

Maruti reported stellar numbers as it reported higher-than-expected margins of 16.9 percent as it experienced economies of scale. PAT rose 3.4 percent on a 7 percent rise in revenue. The valuation (in terms of P/E ratio) of Maruti Suzuki now stands second in the world in the auto industry after Tesla.

In stock-specific action, the RBI imposed a 60 million rupee penalty on Yes Bank and 20 million rupees on IDFC Bank for violations of various norms set by the regulator. Other private sector banks reporting divergences in NPAs include ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank. Public sector banks, on the other hand, are reporting minimal divergences.

Telecom companies were in focus after Reliance Jio announced a hike in tariffs for its flagship scheme by about 15 percent. Shares of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular were in action as investors believed that the price war was gradually easing.

On the global front, the European Central Bank issued a more dovish policy statement than the market was expecting. It kept interest rates on hold and announced plans to cut its QE purchases to 30 billion euros per month from its current 60 billion euros starting in January. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a Senate budget that is likely to open up the path for U.S. tax reform. Advance quarterly GDP for Q3 came in at an annualized 3 percent, significantly exceeding expectations of 2.6 percent.

Prominent names announcing their numbers in the coming week include HDFC, Bharti Infratel, Lupin, Tata Steel and Bharti Airtel.

On the macro front, September IIP data is scheduled to release on Tuesday. Manufacturing PMI data for October will be announced on Wednesday. Services PMI data will be announced on Friday - it had jumped to 50.7 in September from 47.5 in the preceding month.

The coming week will be exceptionally busy in terms of global macro-economic events. The U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will be announcing their monetary policy decisions, which will be followed by the highly anticipated U.S. jobs report at the end of the week. Markets are expecting status quo at the Fed meeting and the next rate hike to occur in December. Nonetheless, the tone of this November meeting will be watched in setting expectations going forward. Also in focus this week will be the announcement of the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

“Suburbicon,” out in U.S. theaters on Friday, follows Gardner Lodge (Matt Damon) in the aftermath of a terrifying break-in at his suburban home, which results in the suspicious death of his wife.

As the investigation into the tragedy deepens, Gardner and his wife’s twin sister Maggie (Julianne Moore) find themselves in a situation quickly escalating beyond their control.

The 27-year-old former world number one entered the contest having lost to the evergreen Williams seven times in as many matches but the resilient Dane served and retrieved brilliantly and emerged with a deserved victory after 89 minutes.

Wozniacki was faultless for an hour as she raced to a one-set and 5-0 lead but Williams always plays to win and the 37-year-old American reeled off four games in a row before the Dane could finally lift the title at the elite, eight-woman event in her fifth appearance.

“It was all going well at 5-0 in the second set, then she went for her shots and I was just so happy to get it done in the end,” Wozniacki, who will rise three places to third in the world rankings after the win, said in a courtside interview.

“Well eight is my lucky number and I figured if I was ever going to beat her it would be today... and I just went out there and did my best.”

The first three games were dominated by the server until the Dane started to find the corners with her powerful backhand and fashioned the first break of the match with back-to-back winners off both flanks.

Williams was trying to get to the net at every opportunity and came forward to good effect after dropping her serve. A vicious cross-court backhand enabled the American to break back immediately on her way to leveling the score at 3-3.

She continued to be the aggressor but the Dane held on in the face of some brutal hitting for her opponent and somehow forged her second break of the set with some exquisite deep hitting to move within one game of taking the opener.

The American came roaring back once more, leaving the Dane looking on as a helpless spectator, with a barrage of winners to get the high-class contest back on serve.

After working so hard to stay in touch, Williams would have been deeply frustrated to gift her opponent the set when the Dane did not have to work to seize the third break in a row, the wayward American sending forehands wide, long and into the net.

Wozniacki had seized the momentum with her variation, depth of shot and complete lack of errors preventing Williams from grabbing any sort of foothold in the contest and the flying Dane raced into a 5-0 lead in 11 second-set minutes.

Needing to hold serve just to stay in the contest, Williams found her rhythm to belatedly get on the scoreboard in the second set and then secured her first break of the second with some solid play against an increasingly anxious Wozniacki.

Williams suddenly appeared relaxed and free, holding easily to heap more pressure on the Dane before stretching every muscle and sinew in an impressive ninth game to break once more and get it back to 5-4.

The crowd wanted more but Wozniacki was not prepared to give them what they wanted, breaking again and sealing victory on her second match point with a backhand winner down the line, and tossing her racket in the air as she celebrated a stunning triumph.

The Luo community largely boycotted Thursday’s election, which was supposed to again pit opposition leader Raila Odinga, a Luo, against President Uhuru Kenyatta, a Kikuyu with a Kalenjin deputy president.

The Supreme Court ordered a repeat after it nullified Kenyatta’s win in an August election on procedural grounds.

The motive and perpetrators for the killing in western Kenya were unclear, but it came a day after villagers from the Luo and Kalenjin communities armed themselves against each other.

The body of 64-year-old George Odumbe, a Luo labourer at the local sugar company, was found with three arrows in the back and severe head wounds, a Reuters witness in the village of Koguta said. It was found in a field between Koguta and the nearby Kalengin village of Mau.

Locals warned the death of the Luo man could spark tit-for-tat violence.

“There’s a desire for revenge by the Luo community, I‘m trying to tell them to stay calm, but they are so bitter and angry,” Gordon Onyango, 32, a Luo, said. “The two sides are both having meetings now and they are both armed.”

Reuters was unable to speak with the Kalenjin community in Mau, but saw a group of young men from the village gathered under a tree. Most were armed with bows and arrows.

Odinga withdrew from the rerun election, saying it would not be fair. In his strongholds in the west, an area that has long felt excluded from political and economic power, protesters prevented polling stations from opening in four counties.

Across Kenya, about 10 percent of polling stations were unable to open, although there were no problems in Kenyatta’s areas. Turnout plummeted to about 35 percent from 80 percent in August, undercutting Kenyata’s hopes for a decisive mandate for a second term.

In some parts of the country, such as Koguta in Kisumu county, protests damaged relations with other communities who wanted to vote for Kenyatta.

That anger risks igniting ethnic violence, which killed around 1,200 people after a disputed 2007 presidential vote, but which has been largely absent from this election.

Slideshow (4 Images)

At least 51 people have been killed in political violence since August, but most deaths have occurred in clashes between protesters and police.

Police, although stationed only 400 metres from where the body was discovered, declined to visit the scene for several hours until reinforcements arrived.

Around five hours after the body was found, police took it to the nearby town of Muhoroni.

Police did not answer calls from Reuters. But Julius Genga, a county legislator, said by phone while he was driving to the scene: “We want the police to be deployed to try to restore calm because after the death of this man, tension is boiling up and we don’t want it to escalate it to unmanageable levels.”

Kericho county governor Paul Chepkwony told Reuters that he hoped the death would be “an isolated one”.

By the end of Friday night’s confrontation, a man had been beaten to death and rows of shops and homes set alight, a worrying taste of how quickly ethnic violence can erupt in the Kenyan capital’s volatile slums.

Almost all the 50 deaths since August’s presidential vote have been in clashes between protesters and police.

The deeper fear of Kenyans is that the months of political strife, exacerbated by the courts annulling the August vote, eat away at deep tribal divisions and ignite a wave of inter-ethnic violence, as happened after a disputed 2007 vote when 1,200 people were killed.

The Kawangware fighting was sparked by rumours that Kikuyu, the tribe of President Uhuru Kenyatta, had drafted in members of the Mungiki to protect them from opposition supporters.

On Friday, a Reuters witness saw a group of men armed with machetes, known locally as pangas, on the streets of Kawangware.

Their identity was unclear, although several residents said they were Mungiki, brought in after opposition loyalists burnt down a prominent Kikuyu-owned business the previous night.

The Mungiki, notorious for castrating and decapitating victims, were blamed for hundreds of deaths in the 2007 clashes. Their relative quiet since has not diminished their reputation.

“They were more than a hundred, and they were carrying all new pangas,” Vitalis Aloyi, a Kawangware resident, said.

Another man said residents had to act to defend themselves.

“We had to teach them not to bring Mungiki here. If they bring Mungiki, we will destroy their property and their lives,” said Kennedy Ochieng, an ethnic Luo, like opposition leader Raila Odinga.

SMOKE RISING

As the pro-Odinga vigilantes, also armed with clubs and machetes, swept down the muddy street they set fire to Kikuyu businesses suspected of hiding Mungiki militiamen, Ochieng said.

One man was killed, and his body burned, leaving a charred spot on the road. Some Odinga supporters denounced him as Mungiki, but no one could explain how they knew.

The next day, with smoke still rising from the twisted wreckage of homes and shops, the remaining traders in Kawangware began loading their wares of pipes, popcorn machines and meat onto trucks.

“All the other tribes are against the Kikuyu here because of the voting,” said Stephen Kamau, whose fruit stall was burned down. “These people will come back and burn more.”

Others in the district, long home to mixed communities, said the truth was more nuanced. As political tensions rose, some businesses had hired local youths for protection, said Rhoda Kungu, a market trader.

She insisted the vigilantes were not Mungiki.

“We are all brothers and sisters. We just want to live in peace,” she said.

Another trader, Brian Njenga, said it may merely have been pro-Odinga youths spotting a chance to enrich themselves, demanding protection money or looting businesses before they burned them.

“Some people are just using this situation to get personal benefit,” Njenga said to sombre nods from a crowd of youths around him. “Many have not worked for a long time because the economy is very down.”

A few hundeds meters down the rubbish-strewn road, hundreds of young men milled around on street corners. Teargas from the night before lingered in the air.

“We want to kill Mungiki. They must know this is our territory,” one man shouted. “Don’t think because it is quiet now that we are at peace. We are just waiting for something!”","In edgy Kenyan slum, a rumour ends in fires and a death",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CX0GE-OZATP

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

King Bhumibol, the world’s longest reigning monarch when he died last year at the age of 88, ruled Thailand from shortly after World War Two and was revered as a stabilising figure through coups, protests and natural disasters.

The $90 million royal funeral drew mourners clad in black from across the country to Bangkok, where King Bhumibol was cremated on Thursday in an elaborate gold crematorium built for the ceremony outside the Grand Palace.

Over 19 million Thais - more than a quarter of the 69 million population - participated in ceremonies by presenting symbolic sandalwood flowers to be burned at temples and crematorium replicas across the country, according to the government.

On Sunday, the late king’s bones were moved to the Chakri Throne Hall, where royal relics are kept within the Grand Palace in a ceremony that involved senior monks from temples across the country. His son, new King Maha Vajiralongkorn, led the religious rite.

On Sunday evening, Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana led the final royal procession on horseback to the Wat Rajabopidh and Wat Bovoranives temples where her grandfather’s ashes were placed in keeping with a ceremony steeped in religious symbolism and tradition. Mourners, some in tears, were gathered outside the temples.

“I will always have him stored in my heart. Whether as pictures, however old and torn, the memory of him will always be kept in my heart,” said Chalermporm Prabutr, 72.

The German now has a great chance to win Sunday’s race, barring any recurrence of Ferrari’s recent reliability problems, but he also knows the title outcome is out of his hands.

Hamilton has a 66-point lead over Vettel, a four-times champion, and the Mercedes driver will become Britain’s first quadruple title holder with two races to spare if he finishes fifth.

“It depends on Lewis. For us, we go all out. We deserve a good result so let’s see what we can do tomorrow,” Vettel told reporters.

Hamilton, last year’s winner from pole, had expected a difficult session and congratulated the German on his milestone.

“I tried to deny him but it wasn’t to be. It was a difficult session and it has been a difficult weekend,” said the Briton, who holds the all-time record of 72 pole positions and was chasing his 10th of the season.

“They did a great job and their car was working better than ours this weekend, but I am still there in the fight,” added the 32-year-old, who feared overtaking would be difficult at the high-altitude Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who had looked like becoming the sport’s youngest pole-sitter until Vettel’s late final lap of one minute 16.488 seconds, qualified alongside Vettel on the front row.

Hamilton was 0.446 seconds off Vettel’s time.

STEWARDS INVESTIGATION

Verstappen had risked losing his front-row slot after being summoned to the stewards for allegedly impeding Hamilton’s team mate Valtteri Bottas in the second phase of the session, but they decided to take no further action.

The Dutch driver, who has had several run-ins with stewards and was demoted from third to fourth after last weekend’s U.S. Grand Prix for exceeding track limits, was already frustrated not to be starting from the top slot.

“Second is good but not given the way it went. I really wanted that pole position,” said the 20-year-old, who played down the incident.

“It’s his own problem if he outbrakes himself at the next corner. I was on the inside and didn’t hold him up,” he told Sky Sports television. “I moved to the inside and was past the point where you go to the right. I don’t see an incident.”

Bottas, who said Verstappen had definitely ruined his lap, will start alongside Hamilton in fourth place with Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen fifth.

French driver Esteban Ocon qualified sixth and ahead of Force India team mate and local hero Sergio Perez, who will line up a disappointing 10th.

The pair have subsequently mended fences and Perez has called on his fans to show respect to his team mate.

Australian Daniel Ricciardo qualified seventh with the Renault pairing of Nico Hulkenberg and Carlos Sainz in eighth and ninth.

Ricciardo said he had struggled to get the tyres up to temperature.

Digital health is one of the areas where the Finnish company seeks future growth opportunities amid tough market for its mainstay telecom network gear business.

Last year, Nokia bought France’s Withings, which makes activity trackers and thermometers, as the first move in the market. But Nokia’s interim report showed on Thursday it had written down 141 million euros ($164 million) of goodwill on the business for which it paid 170 million euros.

“The charge was taken as we updated our projections for the business,” Nokia spokesman said by email.

“Despite the charge, we remain confident in the potential of our digital health business, and believe we have the assets, the brand and the innovation capabilities to succeed.”

Digital health is part of Nokia Technologies unit, which earlier this month said it would halt development of its virtual reality camera.

“We do not tolerate drugs misuse by service personnel. Those found to have fallen short of our high standards face being discharged from service,” a Royal Navy spokesman said.

The Daily Mail newspaper reported that the sailors had failed drugs tests while the submarine was docked in the United States to pick up nuclear warheads and undergo work, and the sailors had been accommodated in hotels on shore.

A defense ministry spokesman declined to comment on the location of the incident but said: “There is no evidence to suggest any individual was under the influence while performing their duties.”

The ministry also confirmed the submarine’s commander had been relieved of his command pending investigation, but declined to give details. Previous reports said this was due to an earlier unrelated incident.

“By the end of 2020 I think every cricket country would have come and played in Pakistan.”","LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Even Pakistan’s prime minister did not believe it could happen but when Sri Lanka visit the eastern city of Lahore on Sunday for a T20 match, the hosts will celebrate the end of eight years of isolation from international cricket.

Less than a year ago, none of this appeared possible for a nation that had largely been shunned by international teams since 2009 due to security risks.

That year gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lanka team from their hotel to Lahore’s Gaddafi stadium for a test match, injuring six players and killing six security personnel and two civilians.

The incident forced Pakistan to play their home matches in the United Arab Emirates and the country has since remained starved of international cricket at home, apart from Zimbabwe’s limited-overs tour in 2015.

Last year, the inaugural Pakistan Super League (PSL), based on the franchise model of the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League, became a success though all the matches were played in the UAE.

Things changed in March this year when Pakistan hosted the final of its domestic T20 competition featuring high-profile international players.

“Even that baby step seemed an impossibility. I can tell you that none of the franchises wanted it, they were scared ... the government was scared...the players were scared,” Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Najam Sethi told Reuters in an interview.

The match proved pivotal in changing the global cricket community’s opinion of Pakistan’s ability to host international matches and garnered support from cricket’s governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC).

The months leading up to the final were filled with endless negotiations with the government, persuading domestic franchise owners and convincing players that security was under control.

“I had two meetings with the prime minister, I raised it with him, he heard me out, he didn’t give me an opinion, he said we will think about it closer to the event,” Sethi said.

As the match drew closer Sethi became desperate, sending then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif numerous requests “from various quarters” in the hope that he would make a favourable announcement.

Sharif’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Weeks before the final was to be played Sharif made the announcement that it could go ahead.

“I think he saw the wisdom of it and took the risk,” said Sethi

ALMOST WENT UP IN SMOKE

In mid-February, less than a month before the final, a suicide attack outside Lahore’s provincial assembly killed 13 and wounded 83.

“There was doom and gloom over here. The franchises came to me and said nothing doing,” Sethi recalled.

A series of late night phone calls and endless meetings with players and franchise owners ensued. The PCB insisted that adequate security measures were in place.

Despite assurances, two days before the match, four international players pulled out, leaving the board 48 hours to find replacements.

“Luckily we had every contingency arrangement in place,” Sethi said.

After the final, Sethi went to work on bringing an international World XI to Pakistan with the support of the ICC.

An international security company hired by cricket’s world governing body gave Pakistan the green light.

Then came the work of assembling a high-profile team for the three-match series.

“I said unless and until you give me top quality players, no way,” Sethi said.

Once the players were finalised, administrators and fans were thrilled to welcome a star-studded World XI team led by South Africa captain Faf du Plessis.

“There was huge tension,” Sethi said, adding that despite all the planning, the PCB was still on edge during the series.

“There were all these calculated risks but in the end it worked out,” he added

Next on the list was Sri Lanka, whose players were reluctant to tour Pakistan after the events of 2009.

On a trip to Colombo, Sethi talked about how Pakistan had always toured Sri Lanka even during the civil war, which ended in 2009, when other countries refused to visit.

“I told them we need you now, when you needed us we were there for you,” he said.

With Sri Lanka’s visit confirmed, Sethi is confident that international cricket in Pakistan will soon be fully restored.

West Indies have committed to playing a three-match series but the dates are still undecided.

“I have two other countries lined up who are ready to come,” Sethi said. “By the end of 2020 I think every cricket country would have come and played in Pakistan.”",Cricket: Pakistan welcomes end of isolation from internationals,https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-pakistan/cricket-pakistan-welcomes-end-of-isolation-from-internationals-idINKBN1CW2JA

They plan to introduce four-year-old Meng Meng to Jiao Qing, a panda three years her senior, in the hope that romance will help her with the frustrations associated with life in captivity that could be behind her habit.

The ECB on Thursday extended its landmark bond-buying stimulus programme until at least September 2018, and said rates will remain at record lows until well after the scheme ends.

Investors appear to have all but ruled out the chance that any rate hike will come before the Italian leaves the ECB in October 2019, making him one of only a handful of major central bank chiefs not to lift rates in the modern era.

Even Ben Bernanke, the ultra-dovish former Federal Reserve Chairman who unleashed three QE programmes worth over $2 trillion in response to the 2008 crisis, raised rates. Not just once, but three times.

And with Britain battling rising inflation caused by a currency crash after its vote to leave the EU, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is expected next week to raise UK rates for the first time in a decade.

“This would be fairly unprecedented for a modern policymaker but at the same time the implementation and the reasons for quantitative easing (QE) in the euro zone are also unprecedented for modern monetary policy,” Rabobank strategist Matt Cairns said.

The majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the ECB to wait until 2019 before raising interest rates and only a handful of economists expect that to happen as early as next year.

The difference between overnight Eonia bank-to-bank rates and forward Eonia rates, as shown in the below chart, is a broader measure of investor expectations for upcoming hikes.

At the end of Draghi’s term in two year’s time, that difference is just 2 basis points, equating to a 20 percent chance of a 10 basis point rise in the ECB’s deposit rate - the minimum it is likely to hike.

A full 10 basis point hike is not priced until the middle of 2020, with further hikes roughly every year after that.

But Andrew Bosomworth of the world’s largest bond fund PIMCO said in keeping policy too loose, Draghi could leave his successor scrambling.

“It is incumbent on the President to set a path for tightening and to avoid a situation where Draghi does nothing and the next president has to get policy normalisation back on track,” he said.

The ECB last raised rates in 2011, under former President Jean-Claude Trichet, to pre-empt what turned out to be a phantom threat of inflation.

Among other major developed economies, a couple of Bank of Japan governors have refrained from raising rates as that country grappled with the threat of deflation over several decades; most notably Satoshi Sumita in the 1980s.

The sources cautioned that while Powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five, Trump had not made a final decision and could always change his mind.

“I will be announcing it sometime next week,” Trump said in a video statement on Instagram. “It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job. I have someone very specific in mind and I think everyone will be very impressed.”

Trump has said he has been considering Powell, as well as Stanford University economist John Taylor, for the post. He also has said he has not ruled out renominating current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February.

He is expected to announce his pick, which would need to win Senate approval, before he departs on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3.

The term of current Fed chair Janet Yellen ends in February 2018, though her term as a Federal Reserve Board governor does not expire until 2024.

Trump had been working from a short list of five candidates that included his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

A senior administration official said on Wednesday that Trump was unlikely to nominate Cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact tax reform legislation currently being debated in Congress.

Trump has also privately voiced a desire to put his own stamp on the central bank, which has dimmed the prospect of him giving a new term to Yellen, another source said.

In an interview with Fox Business Network last Friday, Trump indicated he could nominate both Powell and Taylor for top jobs at the central bank.

England, who lost the Under-17 European Championship final to Spain on penalties in May, added to their success at youth level this year following victories in the Under-20 World Cup and Under-19 European Championship.

It was a remarkable comeback for coach Steve Cooper’s side in front of more than 60,000 spectators as they scored five goals without reply after going down 2-0 with 31 minutes gone.

After Morgan Gibbs-White nearly put England ahead early on, Spain took the lead as Barcelona’s Sergio Gomez beat the offside trap to tap in on 10 minutes. He then struck his fourth of the tournament with a powerful shot from inside the box after the half hour mark.

England hit back through Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster, who headed in Steven Sessegnon’s cross from the right close to halftime and levelled at 2-2 when Gibbs-White turned in another Sessegnon pass to finish a slick move on 58 minutes.

Foden put England ahead when he slotted in Callum Hudson-Odoi’s searching ball before Marc Guehi ended Spain’s hopes of a comeback by making it 4-2. City youth Foden then scored his second on a brisk counter-attack to seal the win.

Striker Brewster, who scored hat-tricks against Brazil and the United States in the last two games, ended the event as the leading scorer with eight goals while man of the match Foden was named the best player of the tournament.

Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement.

He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,” Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.

The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.

Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.

“You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?” Rouhani said.

“Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.

IAEA HEAD VISITS

Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.

“Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,” it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.

“For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.”

Trump’s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano’s agency is in charge of policing.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal.

Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano: “He has no request in this area,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America’s preferred course.","Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-missiles/rouhani-says-iran-will-keep-producing-missiles-state-tv-reports-idUSKBN1CY04S

Spain’s constitutional court has also started a review of Catalonia’s independence vote for prosecutors to decide if it constituted rebellion.

While there was no indication Puigdemont was hoping to come to Belgium, the country is one of few members of the European Union where EU citizens can ask for political asylum.

“It is not unrealistic if you look at the situation,” Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, told Belgian broadcaster VTM.

“They are already talking about a prison sentence,” Francken, a member of Flemish nationalist party N-VA, said. “The question is to what extent he would get a fair trial.”

It would be difficult for Spain to extradite Puigdemont in such a case, he said.

While most European leaders have refrained from commenting on the Spanish crisis, saying it was an internal matter and the country’s constitution should prevail, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called for dialogue between Madrid and Barcelona.

Michel, a centrist from French-speaking Wallonia, has governed in coalition with the N-VA since 2014, a period during which the party toned down its calls for more independence for Belgium’s Dutch-speaking North.

The relationship between Belgium and Spain soured over a similar issue in the 1990s and 2000s, when the country refused to extradite a Spanish couple wanted over alleged involvement with the Basque militant group ETA.",'Not unrealistic' for Catalan leader to get asylum in Belgium - minister,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia-belgium/not-unrealistic-for-catalan-leader-to-get-asylum-in-belgium-minister-idUKKBN1CY05Q?il=0

The cross-party commission, comprising 40 parliamentarians, was set up to look into the scandals and crises that have rocked Italian banks in recent years.

“Only the commission as a whole will be able to make a final judgment, but indications of improper behavior have certainly been found,” Casini said in the interview published on Sunday.

Casini said the initial findings pointed to a “network of complicity” that resulted in offers of employment and consultancy jobs.

“It’s certainly not a good thing seeing Bank of Italy directors quickly take up top positions at the banks that were the target of inquiries,” Casini said. “If this had happened to a politician, it would certainly have triggered a chorus of deserved criticism.”

The cross-party commission has the same investigative powers as the magistrature, although it has little to reach conclusions before the legislature ends. The role of the Bank of Italy and market watchdog Consob, which share supervision of the sector, is expected to come under scrutiny.

The government has had to spend more than 20 billion euros ($23.22 billion) this year to prop up the sector, injecting 5.4 billion euros to salvage Italy’s fourth-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), and offering billions of euros in guarantees as it wound down two major banks in the Veneto region.

Four other, smaller banks were wound down in 2015, hitting thousands of small savers.

Critics have accused both the Bank of Italy and Consob of failing in their oversight duties - allegations both bodies have rejected.

Casini said, however, that the initial findings also showed how many of the judiciary investigations had been triggered by inspections launched by the Bank of Italy itself.

“It’s a mix bag of positives and negatives. We need to understand which had dominated,” he said.

Asked about a risk that the inquiry could serve only as electoral propaganda before a forthcoming election, Casini said he had voiced the same concerns when the commission was set up but now would seek to guarantee that it does not become “political battleground”.

Gold prices in India slipped to 29,209 rupees per 10 grams on Friday, the lowest level in about two months.

Prices in India were at a premium of up to $3 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, up from $2 last week. The slight increase in premiums was due to traders looking to cover for purchases made when rates were higher.

“After Diwali, demand falters every year. This year, even during Diwali demand was lower than usual,” said Daman Prakash Rathod, a director at MNC Bullion, a wholesaler in Chennai.

Last week, Indians celebrated the Diwali and Dhanteras festivals, when buying bullion is considered auspicious.

“Jewellers have to replenish inventory after Diwali sales. Since prices are falling, they will do it very slowly,” said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank.

“In the last few days the government was selling gold bonds. Some investors are giving preference to bonds over physical gold due to tax benefits.”

Meanwhile, benchmark spot gold prices were headed for an about 1 percent weekly decline, having hit a near three-month low of $1,264.15 on Friday.

The drop in rates, however, failed to reignite interest for gold in most Asian hubs.

“In Singapore, several businesses in the region referred to as ‘Little India’ have said that the festival sales were not great and that it had come down when compared to the Diwali season in the last two years,” said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.

“Physical demand didn’t really pick up despite lower prices. While we did have businesses and individuals calling us today due to the price drop, prices had been stagnant for the rest of the week.”

Premiums of 50 cents were being charged over the benchmark in Singapore this week, unchanged from the previous week, while in Hong Kong, they rose to the 60 cents to $1.30 range, as against 50 cents last week.

“There are sporadic large transactions, by buyers who take advantage of the price level and the low premiums, but overall, the market is quiet,” said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner of J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.

In top consumer China, premiums of $6.5-$10 an ounce were being charged over the benchmark, compared with $8-$12 in the previous week.

“There has been some amount of buying in China,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. He, however, said there seems to be a shift toward stocks rather than gold in terms of investments.

In Japan, gold continued to be sold flat versus the benchmark due to a lack of momentum in local rates.",Lower gold prices fail to spark post-Diwali lull in demand,https://in.reuters.com/article/asia-gold-demand/lower-gold-prices-fail-to-spark-post-diwali-lull-in-demand-idINKBN1CW1FB

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow.
Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.
“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.","(Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Thursday it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses over the past year and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies, which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue.

Shares of Twitter soared more than 18 percent to $20.31 in afternoon trading. The company also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months.

Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it “will likely be GAAP profitable” in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.

The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat. It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow. It did not name the companies it had inked deals with.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.

COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.

The decision left thousands of travelers stranded and cut rail access to cities such as Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Hanover and Kiel. The closures also affect popular routes such as from Frankfurt to Berlin and Dortmund to Hamburg.

Hamburg saw widespread flooding in the inner city area, including the area around the new Elbphilharmonie symphony hall.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar.

The $170 billion U.S. media firm was early and careful expanding beyond cable. Two examples are its purchase of NBC Universal - originally with its peacock logo - and a recently launched wireless phone service. Comcast stock has trounced the shares of Verizon Communications and AT&T. The company led by Brian Roberts has even pulled away from Walt Disney’s market value this year.

Thursday’s earnings report confirmed that Comcast lost 125,000 TV subscribers in the third quarter due to competition and hurricanes, something it warned about earlier.

That doesn’t detract much, though, from the longer-term picture. In 2004 Roberts, the chief executive, made a hostile lurch for Disney only to drop the bid. Comcast finally scored when it bought NBC Universal from General Electric in a two-part, $39 billion deal. The TV outfit’s former CEO, Bob Wright, groused in his book that GE, hobbled by the financial crisis, had given away the broadcaster for a song. He reckoned it was worth $45 billion.

AT&T has tried belatedly to follow. The telecom firm offered some $85 billion for HBO owner Time Warner in October last year and is still waiting for regulatory approval. It may have overpaid: Breakingviews calculated when the deal was announced that the expected $1 billion in cost savings won’t cover the hefty $20 billion premium.

Comcast is prudently moving into other areas as well. It launched a mobile service using Verizon’s infrastructure, avoiding acquiring a carrier like T-Mobile US. That may yet be an option, but for the moment it’s mostly upside for Comcast as it dips into the cellphone business.

Roberts has made mistakes. For one, he misjudged the political climate and had to drop a bid for Time Warner Cable, which Charter Communications scooped up. But investors have little to complain about. Since March 2013, when the NBC Universal deal was finally completed, Comcast’s total return, including dividends reinvested, of 96 percent beats the S&P 500 Index and Disney on around 80 percent each. AT&T and Verizon have managed only 15 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Comcast’s steady strategy is paying off.",Breakingviews - Comcast earns its peacock feathers,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-comcast-earns-its-peacock-feathers-idUSKBN1CV3DU

In 2016, U.S. aluminum foil imports from China were valued at $389 million, according to the Commerce Department, which said it would issue its final determination for the duties on Feb. 23.

Chinese Commerce Ministry official Wang Hejun said in a statement late on Saturday that the United States was still using “discriminatory” surrogate country pricing methods to put high duties on Chinese goods.

The United States is not only harming the interests of Chinese companies, but also damaging the authority of multilateral trade rules, Wang said.

“We urge the United States to earnestly fulfill its international obligations, and take real action to correct its mistaken methods,” Wang said, adding that China would take steps to protect Chinese companies’ legal rights.

Beijing complains that the United States uses a now expired clause in China’s 2001 World Trade Organization accession deal that for years allowed other WTO members to use a third country’s prices to assess whether Chinese goods were being dumped.

The U.S. Commerce Department said the aluminum foil duties were based on evidence using its standard methodology for determining dumping duties against non-market economies.

Washington has determined in the past that such measures were needed because China failed the test of whether it operates as a market economy, given the government’s control over price and output decisions of enterprises and other factors, such as the extent to which its currency is convertible.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has made enforcement of trade laws a top priority.

Atualmente, as contas de luz estão com bandeira vermelha nível 2. Até outubro, o custo extra era 3,50 reais a cada 100 kilowatts-hora consumidos para este nível tarifário, mas a partir de novembro esse custo subirá mais de 40 por cento, para 5 reais, conforme diretriz da Aneel.

A Aneel vai abrir uma audiência pública para discutir as mudanças, mas elas já valerão a partir de novembro, em caráter excepcional.

“Não houve evolução na situação dos reservatórios das usinas hidrelétricas em relação ao mês anterior e, ainda que não haja risco de desabastecimento de energia elétrica, é preciso reforçar as ações relacionadas ao uso consciente e combate ao desperdício”, disse a Aneel em nota.

O nível 2 da bandeira indica a necessidade de operar usinas térmicas mais caras para compensar a geração hidráulica inibida pela falta de chuvas.

Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get money out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, entered his plea in federal court in Boston.

Rocha, who pled guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7. While the charges each carry up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 40-month term based on his cooperation.

The 28-year-old’s case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.

Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.

TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.

Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced in March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.

In 2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, asked someone who became a cooperating witness to help transfer cash generated from the scheme that Wanzeler had hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, prosecutors said.

The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.

In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.

After a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex, prosecutors said.

Clashes in Kawangware and in a village in western Kenya following Thursday’s vote were the first signs that face-offs between Odinga supporters and the police might eventually morph into neighbors turning against each other.

“A country cannot be ruled by the gun. Standing here in this church we want to condemn the militarization of politics in this country,” Odinga told residents in the Nairobi slum.

The veteran opposition leader had boycotted the re-run of an August presidential election that was nullified by Kenya’s Supreme Court on procedural grounds, leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta with an almost free run against six minor candidates.

On Friday, a day after the repeat vote was held in most of the country, ethnic violence in Kawangware saw dozens of homes and shops torched and one man killed. Most of buildings torched belonged to residents from the Kenyatta’s Kikuyu tribe.

One man from Odinga’s Luo group was killed overnight near Koguta village in the west of the country, after residents from two ethnic groups backing different candidates armed themselves.

If such isolated incidents become a trend, it could ignite large swathes of Kenya, as happened after a 2007 presidential election when weeks of violence left 1,200 dead. That sent ripples throughout East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and diplomatic hub.

In his speech, Odinga condemned violence generally and did not single out any particular attack.

“We have come here to give consolation to those who were beaten and killed. We as NASA condemn what happened,” he told worshippers at a church in Kawangware, referring to his National Super Alliance, an opposition coalition.

Odinga boycotted Thursday’s vote because he said the contest would not be fair. Instead, he wanted the Oct. 26 contest dismissed and fresh elections held within 90 days.

His withdrawal means Kenyans are watching the turnout, rather than the result, for an indication of Kenyatta’s popularity for a second, five-year term.

Results published on Sunday by the election commission showed that Kenyatta had won slightly more than 98 percent of the vote with results in from 244 out of 291 constituencies.

Turnout for the constituencies counted so far was 43 percent. That figure is likely to decrease when it includes returns of 0 from least 23 constituencies where authorities were unable to open even a single polling station because of protests by Odinga’s supporters.

With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement’s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament.

Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one.

The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom.

Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust.

The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s use of offshore tax havens.

In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world’s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability.

After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties.

The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament’s 63 seats.

“The opposition has a majority, so that’s a message. But we’ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,” Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday.

The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.

The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament.

The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year’s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland’s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters.

Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said: ”I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it’s normal that we should be a part of a future government.

“We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,” he said. “We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.”

His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.

The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year’s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.

“I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,” said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government.

The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes.

The Pirate Party, which last year rode a wave of anger against the establishment to become the third biggest party in parliament, stood to get 9 percent of votes in Saturday’s election down from 14 percent last year.",Iceland leans toward leftist government in snap election,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iceland-election/iceland-leans-toward-leftist-government-in-snap-election-idUKKBN1CX0QU

If all goes as scripted, the bank will hike borrowing costs in the coming week for the first time in more than 10 years. But is the country really ready?

The consensus is for rise to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent.

That 0.25 percent was where the BoE put Bank Rate just over a year ago, shortly after British voters elected to leave the European Union. And there’s the rub: the uncertainty the vote triggered is still there.

A Reuters poll published in the past week showed more than 70 percent of economists believe now is not the time to raise rates -- though slightly more than that said it would happen anyway.

BoE Governor Mark Carney has made it clear a hike is in the offing, if not specifically saying at this coming meeting.

His concern is that low unemployment means Britain’s economy has little spare capacity and, accordingly, faces upward inflation pressure. Added to that are moves by other major central banks to rein in loose monetary policy, which could also push inflation higher by weakening the pound further.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since late 2015 and is expected to do so again. The European Central Bank is cutting back on its bond buying, albeit gently.

So the BoE needs to concern itself with a pressured pound and high employment driving up inflation that, at 3 percent, is already well above target and the highest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations.

But ranged against that is huge political and economic uncertainty over how Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will play out.

Companies are unclear about what to plan for, ranging from little short-term change to a complete revolution in how they do business.

Consumers too are wary as, while Britain’s economy has by no means not gone over a cliff, it has had some wobbles.

Retail sales, for example, contracted on a monthly basis in September and were up 1.2 percent year-on-year versus 4.1 percent a year earlier.

Preliminary third-quarter growth figures in the past week, meanwhile, were slightly better than expected. But at 1.5 percent year-on-year they are well below pre-Brexit vote levels and significantly lag both the United States and the euro zone.

This had prompted some economists to suggest Carney and the BoE are about to “do a Trichet” -- mirroring then-ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet’s raising of rates in 2008 just as the financial crisis was hitting.

Former BoE policymaker Danny Blanchflower - who voted against the BoE’s last hike in 2007, and has been regularly critical of suggestions to tighten policy since - has been scathing about the idea of a UK hike now.

“Nothing in data whatsoever says there should be a rate rise,” he tweeted.

(NOT) RISING SUN

The BoE is not the only central bank discussing policy. The Bank of Japan will announce its decisions on Tuesday.

Deflation -- Japan’s biggest economic problem for much of the past 20 years -- is over, but inflation is far from entrenched, limping along at just 0.7 percent year-on-year.

The economy too is somewhat off the pace, with the International Monetary Fund predicting 1.5 percent growth this year, though that is an improvement from 2016.

The biggest issue among economists with regard to the BoJ is whether it should reveal its plans to exit its ultra-loose monetary policy.

“We are anticipating few major changes in monetary policy,” Katsunori Kitakura, lead strategist at SuMi TRUST, wrote in a note. “The medium-term outlook for the Japanese economy is largely unchanged since the last policy meeting so the BoJ is likely to maintain the status quo.”

Underlining this, Reuters polls suggest the BoJ won’t start rolling back its monetary stimulus until late next year at the earliest -- the sort of unclouded policy outlook that the BoE’s Carney might arguably have cause to envy before the week is out.",Global Economy: Place your bets for the Brexit rate hike,https://in.reuters.com/article/global-economy-outlook/global-economy-place-your-bets-for-the-brexit-rate-hike-idINKBN1CW1RJ

The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history.

The Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for this weekend’s attack. The government responded by sacking two of the country’s top security officials.

“So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,” Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters.

At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. And a woman, Madobe Nunow, was beheaded while her “three children were shot dead,” he said.

A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel.

Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said.

The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel’s defenses. Then gunmen stormed the building.

The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.

The government sacked the country’s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, a statement from the prime minister’s office said.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.

”After the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces.

Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. The government and al Shabaab typically give different figures for victims in such attacks.

The twin bombings in Mogadishu on Oct. 14 killed at least 358 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history, igniting nationwide outrage. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but the method - a large truck bomb - is one it has often used.

The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug.

CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No. 3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday. It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize.

If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.

“It’s an alternate model at this point. It’s not clear that it’s definitely a better one,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said. “More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.”

For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.

But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies.

UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.

Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path. It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years. That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.

CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp. If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cigna’s interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.

Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.

The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.

Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.

SWINGING PENDULUM

Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.

Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.

UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.

Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.

Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.

But with those profits in hand, and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending, they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits, Leerink’s Gupta said.

Another potential lure of a deal for Aetna would be to capitalize on the growing number of simple health services offered in a CVS store, from flu shots to blood pressure checks. Reimbursing such patient care outside of a doctor’s office or hospital could cut healthcare costs, Gupta said.",CVS bid for Aetna: A $66 billion bet on cutting drug costs,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-healthcare-insurers/cvs-bid-for-aetna-a-66-billion-bet-on-cutting-drug-costs-idUKKBN1CY0EG?il=0

The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug.

CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No. 3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday. It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize.

If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.

“It’s an alternate model at this point. It’s not clear that it’s definitely a better one,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said. “More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.”

For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.

But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies.

UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.

Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path. It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years. That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.

CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp. If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cigna’s interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.

Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.

The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.

Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.

SWINGING PENDULUM

Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.

Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.

UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.

Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.

Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.

But with those profits in hand, and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending, they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits, Leerink’s Gupta said.

Another potential lure of a deal for Aetna would be to capitalize on the growing number of simple health services offered in a CVS store, from flu shots to blood pressure checks. Reimbursing such patient care outside of a doctor’s office or hospital could cut healthcare costs, Gupta said.",CVS bid for Aetna: A $66 billion bet on cutting drug costs,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CY0EI-OCABS

Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, was elected with 61.1 percent of the vote, the United Conservative Party announced at an event in Alberta’s largest city of Calgary.

Kenney will head a party formed this year from the Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties. It presents a serious challenge in the 2019 provincial election to the incumbent left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), which took power in 2015 helped partly by a divided right.

Alberta, where the Conservatives held power for 40 years before being ousted in a shock election by the NDP, is home to Canada’s vast oil sands and is the largest exporter of crude to the United States. But it has been struggling with a three-year slump in global oil prices and a C$10.3 billion ($8.24 billion) deficit.

Kenney has been eager to develop policies aimed at cutting costs for the oil and gas sector and is likely to be welcomed by the energy industry.

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.

Trump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)

We know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.

Although Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.

Trump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)

The withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.

While this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.

The problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.

Republican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.

When considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.",Commentary: Blame the Constitution for Trump’s undemocratic executive orders,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-executive-commentary/commentary-blame-the-constitution-for-trumps-undemocratic-executive-orders-idUSKBN1CN2NR

If all goes as scripted, the bank will hike borrowing costs in the coming week for the first time in more than 10 years. But is the country really ready?

The consensus is for rise to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent.

That 0.25 percent was where the BoE put Bank Rate just over a year ago, shortly after British voters elected to leave the European Union. And there’s the rub: the uncertainty the vote triggered is still there.

A Reuters poll published in the past week showed more than 70 percent of economists believe now is not the time to raise rates -- though slightly more than that said it would happen anyway.

BoE Governor Mark Carney has made it clear a hike is in the offing, if not specifically saying at this coming meeting.

His concern is that low unemployment means Britain’s economy has little spare capacity and, accordingly, faces upward inflation pressure. Added to that are moves by other major central banks to rein in loose monetary policy, which could also push inflation higher by weakening the pound further.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since late 2015 and is expected to do so again. The European Central Bank is cutting back on its bond buying, albeit gently.

So the BoE needs to concern itself with a pressured pound and high employment driving up inflation that, at 3 percent, is already well above target and the highest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations.

But ranged against that is huge political and economic uncertainty over how Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will play out.

Companies are unclear about what to plan for, ranging from little short-term change to a complete revolution in how they do business.

Consumers too are wary as, while Britain’s economy has by no means not gone over a cliff, it has had some wobbles.

Retail sales, for example, contracted on a monthly basis in September and were up 1.2 percent year-on-year versus 4.1 percent a year earlier.

Preliminary third-quarter growth figures in the past week, meanwhile, were slightly better than expected. But at 1.5 percent year-on-year they are well below pre-Brexit vote levels and significantly lag both the United States and the euro zone.

This had prompted some economists to suggest Carney and the BoE are about to “do a Trichet” -- mirroring then-ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet’s raising of rates in 2008 just as the financial crisis was hitting.

Former BoE policymaker Danny Blanchflower - who voted against the BoE’s last hike in 2007, and has been regularly critical of suggestions to tighten policy since - has been scathing about the idea of a UK hike now.

“Nothing in data whatsoever says there should be a rate rise,” he tweeted.

(NOT) RISING SUN

The BoE is not the only central bank discussing policy. The Bank of Japan will announce its decisions on Tuesday.

Deflation -- Japan’s biggest economic problem for much of the past 20 years -- is over, but inflation is far from entrenched, limping along at just 0.7 percent year-on-year.

The economy too is somewhat off the pace, with the International Monetary Fund predicting 1.5 percent growth this year, though that is an improvement from 2016.

The biggest issue among economists with regard to the BoJ is whether it should reveal its plans to exit its ultra-loose monetary policy.

“We are anticipating few major changes in monetary policy,” Katsunori Kitakura, lead strategist at SuMi TRUST, wrote in a note. “The medium-term outlook for the Japanese economy is largely unchanged since the last policy meeting so the BoJ is likely to maintain the status quo.”

Underlining this, Reuters polls suggest the BoJ won’t start rolling back its monetary stimulus until late next year at the earliest -- the sort of unclouded policy outlook that the BoE’s Carney might arguably have cause to envy before the week is out.",Place your bets for the Brexit rate hike,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-global-economy-outlook/place-your-bets-for-the-brexit-rate-hike-idUKKBN1CW1R9

Unbeaten champion Joshua opened up a dreadful cut above 36-year Takam’s right eye in the fourth round and although the durable France-based Cameroonian battled on the fight was halted by referee Phil Edwards after a series of heavy blows.

It was far from a straightforward night for Joshua in the Principality Stadium, however, as the 28-year-old appeared to suffer a broken nose in the second round after an accidental clash of heads with his shorter and lighter opponent.

Takam, who stood in 12 days ago after Joshua’s original opponent Kubrat Pulev suffered an injury in training, proved a worthy challenger and was still throwing punches despite blood streaming from his eyes for half the fight.

Joshua did force a standing count in the fourth but never totally dominated a wily opponent who clearly disagreed with Edwards’s decision to end the contest - only the second time he had been stopped in 40 fights.

“It was a good fight until the referee stopped it so I have the utmost respect for Takam,” former Olympic champion Joshua, who took his record to 20-0, said in the ring.

“I have no interest in what is going on with the officials, that’s not my job. I think people want to see Takam unconscious on the floor, and that’s what I was trying to get to.”

Joshua, who was fighting for the first time since his epic victory over Wladimir Klitschko in April, began in cagey fashion with neither fighter landing a serious blow in round one.

The fight took a twist in round two when Takam’s head clattered into Joshua’s nose, making the Londoner wince.

Joshua sprang into life and dominated the next few rounds and cut Takam with a stinging right hook in the fourth before briefly flooring his opponent.

It looked as though the fight would be stopped as Takam struggled to see through the blood, but the underdog showed tremendous courage and asked serious questions of the champion whose nose injury affected his breathing.

Joshua was not at his fluent best but was way ahead on the scorecards when he put together a sustained attack in the 10th to convince the referee to intervene.

The sources cautioned that while Powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five, Trump had not made a final decision and could always change his mind.

“I will be announcing it sometime next week,” Trump said in a video statement on Instagram. “It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job. I have someone very specific in mind and I think everyone will be very impressed.”

Trump has said he has been considering Powell, as well as Stanford University economist John Taylor, for the post. He also has said he has not ruled out renominating current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February.

He is expected to announce his pick, which would need to win Senate approval, before he departs on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3.

A senior administration official said on Wednesday that Trump was unlikely to nominate Cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact tax reform legislation currently being debated in Congress.

Trump has also privately voiced a desire to put his own stamp on the central bank, which has dimmed the prospect of him giving a new term to Yellen, another source said.

Some lawmakers from states where state and local taxes are high and people benefit most from the federal income tax deduction are reluctant to contemplate such an elimination. It would be one of several measures aimed at offsetting lost revenue under sweeping tax cuts planned by President Donald Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress.

“We’re working with these lawmakers. We are making progress, but we aren’t there yet,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News Channel. “I‘m hopeful at the end of the day we can find a good solution for them.”

A budget blueprint central to Republican efforts to enact the tax cut package - because it will enable easier passage of the package through the Senate - barely squeaked through the House on Thursday, with Democrats solidly opposed and a number of Republicans voting no in an effort to protect the deduction.

Republican leaders had sketched out a tax cut plan that would eliminate the tax break, although detailed legislation will not be unveiled until next Wednesday.

Brady also said lawmakers were exchanging ideas with Trump over how to handle 401(k) retirement savings plans.

In another measure to offset lost revenue, House Republicans have considered eliminating or capping the ability to contribute to the plans on a pre-tax basis, but Trump has said he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program.

“We want to increase the amount that you can give to your 401(k) or IRA (individual retirement account), for 401(k)s up to $20,000 or more,” Brady told Fox, without specifying whether that would be on a pre-tax or after-tax basis.

“We’re actually exchanging ideas with the president on how we help people save more and save sooner in their lives.”

The current cap on pre-tax 401(k) contributions is $18,000 a year, and that is set to rise to $18,500 next year.",Key House lawmaker sees progress allaying tax deduction concerns: Fox,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-deduction/key-house-lawmaker-sees-progress-allaying-tax-deduction-concerns-fox-idUSKBN1CW2CI?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The “Green Belt” project - first conceived in the 1970s, long before the fall of the Iron Curtain - was awarded the German Environmental Prize on Sunday at a ceremony in the northern city of Braunschweig.

The winners “called into life a European vision for the ‘Green Belt’ and a symbol for overcoming the Cold War,” the German Federal Environmental Foundation said in a statement.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier lauded the project during the awards ceremony as a beautiful post-Cold War story that took advantage of the unique environmental conditions in the former no-man’s land.

“The ‘Green Belt’ is now home to countless natural wonders that have been crowded out in other areas,” he said.

Environmental activists and researchers Inge Sielman, Kai Frobel and Hubert Weiger, won a combined 245,000 euros ($284,300) for the project.

Frobel told broadcaster Deutsche Welle that the former exclusion area had given nature “a 40-year holiday” since it had remained largely undisturbed.

“We discovered that over 90 percent of the bird species that were rare or highly endangered in Bavaria - such as the whinchat, the corn bunting and the European nightjar - could be found in the Green Belt. It became a final retreat for many species, and it still is today,” he said.

It is also home to over 1,200 species of animals and plants that are listed as endangered or close to extinction, including the black stork, dragonflies and the European tree frog.

The German project was expanded in 2002 to encompass 12,500 km of European territory, and now includes 24 countries and 150 conservation organizations.

Frobel said researchers were in close touch with South Korean officials about steps to ensure that the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea could eventually be turned into a similar nature reserve.

Two business executives - Bernhard and Johannes Oswald - also received 245,000 euros for their development of new electrical motors for industrial use that cut energy use by up to 50 percent, the group said.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Saturday opened an exhibition at the Barberini Museum in Potsdam near Berlin that seeks to illuminate how artists saw and represented themselves in a state that kept tight controls on all creative pursuits.

“Behind the Mask: Artists in the GDR” includes 100 paintings, sculptures, photographs and other artworks created by more than 80 artists from the state’s creation in 1949 until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

Germany’s Sept. 24 national election highlighted the difference in mood and politics between east and west. It swept the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party into parliament for the first time in what experts largely describe as a protest vote against Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 decision to allow in over a million mostly Muslim migrants.

The election was seen as a wake-up call about lingering divisions between the former Communist east and the capitalist west since support for the AfD was particularly strong in eastern states like Saxony, where it bested Merkel’s conservatives to become the biggest party.

Steinmeier last month said the election had exposed “large and small cracks” in society and called on democratic lawmakers to join forces against any return to nationalism.

On Saturday, he said he hoped the wide-ranging exhibit would enable a deeper understanding of how East German artists dealt with the challenges of creative expression in a country where art was often “censored, restricted or instrumentalized.”

“This exhibition ... will open our eyes anew,” Steinmeier said in the text of a speech at the exhibit’s official opening. “That is why it is a very important milestone on the path toward one another that we embarked on a quarter century ago - and that is taking longer than we all imagined back then.”

The display offers insights “into how people lived, thought and work, and how the world was seen, and what was so important and valuable that it was artistically rendered,” he said.

Ortrud Westheider, director of the museum, said the concept of “mask” was useful for organizing the show because it showed how artists were at once forced into a certain role, but also makes clear that they were aware of that fact.

Curator Michael Philipp said the exhibit aimed to show “the leeway that artists had, and the leeway that they fought for, chose and used” despite governmental constraints.

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: China's media crackdown won't work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-chinas-media-crackdown-wont-work-idUSKBN1CW2JW

The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history.

The Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for this weekend’s attack. The government responded by sacking two of the country’s top security officials.

“So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,” Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters.

At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. And a woman, Madobe Nunow, was beheaded while her “three children were shot dead,” he said.

A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel.

Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said.

The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel’s defenses. Then gunmen stormed the building.

The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.

The government sacked the country’s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, a statement from the prime minister’s office said.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.

”After the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces.

The bemused bovine and camera-wielding humans stared at each other through a chain-link fence for several minutes, according to live news video.

At other times the beast wandered curiously around the 526-acre (212-acre) Prospect Park, the largest in the borough of Brooklyn, and the artificial turf field normally used for human sporting events.

Officers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.

Police eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of baseball field’s bench area after an officer appeared to fire a tranquilizer dart at it.

Officers then seemed content to let the cow roam between cars, waiting for the drug to take effect before they were able to rope the beast and load it into an NYPD horse trailer.

It was not clear where the beast came from or how it got lost. Police said they would turn it over to the animal control department after they caught it.

The chase drew torrents of posts on social media, many featuring groan-inducing puns.

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

SLIGHT UNIONIST LEAD

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Slideshow (4 Images)

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia-poll/hundreds-of-thousands-march-for-unified-spain-poll-shows-depths-of-division-idINKBN1CY06U?il=0

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

Air Canada Flight AC781, an A320 originating in Montreal, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) on Sunday after receiving proper clearance only to learn that a subsequent message from air traffic control was not received by the crew, a spokeswoman for the airline said by email.

Air traffic control at SFO had instructed the Air Canada crew multiple times to execute a go-around because the controller was not certain that a preceding arrival would be completely clear of the runway before the jet was due to land, said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor.

“The Air Canada crew did not acknowledge any of the controller’s instructions,” Gregor said by email.

“Upon landing, the crew was informed the tower had attempted unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft, however, the message was not received by the crew,” Air Canada spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur wrote in a separate email.

The FAA was already investigating a separate incident from July after an Air Canada pilot lined up to land on a taxiway at SFO where four other planes were waiting to depart.

Gregor said a supervisor tried to alert Sunday’s flight by using a red light gun to alert the plane to go around, as is standard practice when an air crew is not responding to radio instructions. Instead, the flight landed, as previously authorized, on runway 28R at 9:26 p.m. PDT (0626 GMT).

Mark Garnier, a junior international trade minister, asked secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy two sex toys and he also called her “sugar tits”, the Mail on Sunday reported.

Garnier told the newspaper that the comment was part of an amusing conversation about a television show, and that asking her to buy the toys was “good humored high jinks”.

Edmondson, in comments to the paper, disputed Garnier’s recollection of the incidents, including his assertion that they were “high jinks”.

Garnier was not immediately available for comment to Reuters through his constituency or parliamentary offices.

The report comes after May’s spokeswoman said on Friday any unwanted sexual behavior was “completely unacceptable” and any minister who acted inappropriately would face “serious action”.

She was reacting to a report in another British newspaper that described a culture of sexual harassment among lawmakers and their staff working in parliament.

Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said on Sunday May had asked officials to investigate if Garnier, whose role is outside the cabinet immediately surrounding the May, had broken the government ministers’ code of behavior.

“These stories, if they are true, are obviously totally unacceptable,” Hunt told BBC television.

“The Cabinet Office will be conducting an investigation as to whether there has been a breach of the ministerial code in this particular case, but as you know the facts are disputed.”

May will also write to John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, to ask for his advice about changing the culture there, Hunt said.

Reports of inappropriate behavior in British politics, and in other industries, have followed dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove apologized on Saturday after he likened being interviewed by a BBC radio presenter to entering Weinstein’s bedroom. After the analogy was widely criticized, Gove apologized for what he said was a “clumsy attempt at humor”.

The Sun newspaper said on Friday that women working in politics in Westminster had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators.

“The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics,” May’s spokeswoman said on Friday.",British minister to be investigated over sexual harassment allegation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-harassment/british-minister-to-be-investigated-over-sexual-harassment-allegation-idUSKBN1CY0HD?il=0

The auto safety agency said in a report that it wants to find any “unnecessary regulatory barriers” to self-driving cars “particularly those that are not equipped with controls for a human driver.”

The agency also wants comments on what research it needs to conduct before deciding whether to eliminate or rewrite regulations. But it could take the agency years to complete the research and finalize rule changes, and advocates are pushing Congress to act.

NHTSA said in a statement it plans to issue a formal notice in the “near future requesting comment” on the hurdles. The agency hopes to make the notice public by the end of November.

Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. The agency said last year that current regulations pose “significant” regulatory hurdles to vehicles without human controls.

In early October, a U.S. Senate committee unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls and would allow the agency to waive requirements.

General Motors Co (GM.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes.

The Senate Commerce Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from NHTSA for safety rules for up to 80,000 vehicles annually within three years.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

The 27-year-old former world number one entered the contest having lost to the evergreen Williams seven times in as many matches but the resilient Dane served and retrieved brilliantly and emerged with a deserved victory after 89 minutes.

Wozniacki was faultless for an hour as she raced to a one-set and 5-0 lead but Williams always plays to win and the 37-year-old American reeled off four games in a row before the Dane could finally lift the title at the elite, eight-woman event in her fifth appearance.

“It was all going well at 5-0 in the second set, then she went for her shots and I was just so happy to get it done in the end,” Wozniacki, who will rise three places to third in the world rankings after the win, said in a courtside interview.

“Well eight is my lucky number and I figured if I was ever going to beat her it would be today... and I just went out there and did my best.”

The first three games were dominated by the server until the Dane started to find the corners with her powerful backhand and fashioned the first break of the match with back-to-back winners off both flanks.

Williams was trying to get to the net at every opportunity and came forward to good effect after dropping her serve. A vicious cross-court backhand enabled the American to break back immediately on her way to leveling the score at 3-3.

She continued to be the aggressor but the Dane held on in the face of some brutal hitting for her opponent and somehow forged her second break of the set with some exquisite deep hitting to move within one game of taking the opener.

The American came roaring back once more, leaving the Dane looking on as a helpless spectator, with a barrage of winners to get the high-class contest back on serve.

After working so hard to stay in touch, Williams would have been deeply frustrated to gift her opponent the set when the Dane did not have to work to seize the third break in a row, the wayward American sending forehands wide, long and into the net.

Wozniacki had seized the momentum with her variation, depth of shot and complete lack of errors preventing Williams from grabbing any sort of foothold in the contest and the flying Dane raced into a 5-0 lead in 11 second-set minutes.

Needing to hold serve just to stay in the contest, Williams found her rhythm to belatedly get on the scoreboard in the second set and then secured her first break of the second with some solid play against an increasingly anxious Wozniacki.

Williams suddenly appeared relaxed and free, holding easily to heap more pressure on the Dane before stretching every muscle and sinew in an impressive ninth game to break once more and get it back to 5-4.

The crowd wanted more but Wozniacki was not prepared to give them what they wanted, breaking again and sealing victory on her second match point with a backhand winner down the line, and tossing her racket in the air as she celebrated a stunning triumph.

Pesquisadores da Escola de Medicina da Universidade Stanford desvendaram o laço entre a maconha e a frequência sexual em um estudo publicado nesta sexta-feira no periódico científico Journal of Sexual Medicine.

Cientistas da Califórnia chegaram a tais conclusões após uma análise retrospectiva de dados de 50 mil norte-americanos de 25 a 45 anos de idade compilados de 2002 a 2015 pela Pesquisa Nacional de Crescimento Familiar. Os Centros de Controle e Prevenção de Doenças do governo federal patrocinam o estudo.

Os entrevistados foram indagados quantas vezes tiveram relações heterossexuais nas quatro semanas anteriores e com que frequência fumaram maconha nos últimos 12 meses, explicaram os pesquisadores de Stanford em um comunicado à imprensa.

As mulheres que eram usuárias diárias da erva fizeram sexo em média 7,1 vezes nas quatro semanas anteriores, mais do que a média de 6 vezes daquelas que negaram ter usado maconha no ano anterior. Entre os homens, os usuários diários relataram 6,9 vezes, e os não-usuários 5,6.

“Em outras palavras, os usuários de maconha estão fazendo sexo cerca de 20 por cento a mais do que os abstêmios”, disse o principal autor do estudo, doutor Michael Eisenberg, professor-assistente de urologia de Stanford.

Dado que o casal típico faz sexo em média uma vez por semana, segundo Eisenberg, compartilhar um cachimbo ou cigarro pode proporcionar até 20 relações sexuais adicionais por ano.

“Acho que, se você perguntasse a um homem ou a uma mulher, fazer sexo 20 vezes mais ao longo de um ano pareceria muito”, disse Eisenberg.

Costumava-se pensar que os casais fumavam mais depois do sexo, mas Eisenberg disse que suas descobertas mostram que o oposto é verdadeiro para “todas as raças, níveis educacionais, grupos de renda e religiões, todas as condições de saúde, casados ou não e com filhos ou não”.

A maconha é legal para uso medicinal ou recreativo de adultos em 29 Estados norte-americanos e no Distrito de Columbia, disse Morgan Fox, porta-voz do Projeto de Políticas para a Maconha.

Hoje uma porcentagem recorde de norte-americanos – 64 por cento – acredita que o uso de drogas deveria ser legal para adultos, de acordo com uma pesquisa do instituto Gallup publicada nesta semana.

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

SLIGHT UNIONIST LEAD

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia-poll/catalan-independence-parties-seen-losing-parliamentary-majority-in-election-poll-idUSKBN1CY072

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

But he’s still smiling.

“At least we have something left,” he said, standing in a room with clothes, toys, ornaments and damaged pictures strewn across the floor.

“Others have nothing. They lost their homes, they lost their lives.”

Ismail, 44, the Imam of a nearby mosque, considers himself one of the luckiest people in Marawi. The city was devastated by more than 150 days of battles between government forces and pro-Islamic State militants that killed more than 1,100 people and displaced some 350,000.

His house is in Marawi’s safe zone, an area long abandoned by residents but untouched by unrelenting shelling and military air strikes that have all but flattened the city’s commercial heart, destroying thousands of homes, shops and vehicles.

Six days after troops killed the last remaining rebels, Ismail was among about 4,000 people allowed to return to their homes on Sunday in Marawi’s Basak Malutlot area.

Many like him have discovered their houses were looted and left in disarray.

“I opened the door and I was shocked, but I‘m still happy to be home,” he said.

Ismail fled with his family on May 24 during a fierce three-day firefight that erupted just 50 meters away, when security forces tried to raid the hideout of notorious militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State’s anointed “emir” in Southeast Asia.

Hapilon escaped, then issued a call to arms to hundreds of insurgents to initiate their planned takeover of Marawi. It sparked the Philippines’ biggest urban battle in recent history, and fears that Islamic State’s extremist agenda had gained a foothold in the south of the mainly Catholic country.

HAPPY HOMECOMING

There were scenes of joy and chaos as a convoy of returning residents poured in to Marawi to a cacophony of horns and whistles, jamming what only a few hours earlier were deserted streets.

Armed police at checkpoints cross-checked documents and pictures of each passengers from the 712 families, to guard against possible infiltration by militants.

Babies cried as officials at a public hall shouted on megaphones to try to establish order as hundreds jostled to register for the sack of rice and 5,000 pesos ($97) allocated to each household.

With a stern face, the district’s elderly chairwoman, Jamellah Indol Saro, yelled in the local Maranao dialect at anxious residents to calm down.

“I told them we have to thank Allah we’re still alive,” she said, smiling.

Some 6,500 families are due to return this week in a phased repatriation, a fraction of the 77,000 that fled to evacuation camps or nearby towns. Many face a lengthy wait for vast swathes of Marawi to be rebuilt.

Retired government employee Mitormar Goling, 72, came home to find jewellery, money, furniture and antiques had been stolen. He said he feared he would have starved or been killed had he stayed behind.

“We felt the ground trembling from the air strikes. We didn’t know if the army could protect us,” said Goling, wearing sunglasses and a white skull cap.

“If you don’t believe in their ideology, ISIS sees you as the enemy,” he said, referring to Islamic State.

DESTROY CITY TO SAVE IT

He was among many people who said they understood that the military had to destroy the city to save it.

Norida Manna’s three-storey house was levelled by an air strike, but she’s thankful she’s alive.

The office clerk and single mother of six will now live at her sister’s home, from which she fled in May as troops outside battled hooded, black-clad gunmen who helped the escape of Hapilon.

The rebel commander was subsequently killed in a military operation 13 days ago.

“My home was destroyed, but I don’t blame the military. They had a job to do,” she said.

“I have nothing left, but to us, every day is a happy one now.”","Losses, looting as Philippine war's fortunate few return home",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-militants-return/losses-looting-as-philippine-wars-fortunate-few-return-home-idUSKBN1CY0GN

GE is investing about $2.1 billion in GE Digital this year, and executives had said that amount would fall in 2018.

Flannery on Wednesday made his first direct remarks about the digital strategy since he became CEO on Aug. 1. He has begun slashing costs in other areas, including reducing staff, grounding corporate jets and axing the “Maserati benefit” of corporate cars for about 600 senior executives.

Flannery is due to unveil new financial targets on Nov. 13 and is under heavy pressure to turn GE around after the company’s third-quarter earnings and cash flow badly missed targets. GE stock is down 32 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up 14 percent,

GE’s digital strategy is built around a cloud-based software platform, known as Predix, that connects factories, power plants and other industrial equipment to computers that improve performance and predict outages.

But Predix’s limited capabilities and performance problems have caused GE to lose out to competitors such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and startups such as Uptake and C3IOT.

Flannery said on Wednesday that GE will focus on selling Predix in its own businesses: energy, oil-and-gas, aviation, healthcare, transportation and mining, as Reuters reported in August.

In other markets, “We’re going to be more selective ... and do it largely through partners,” Flannery said at GE’s annual Minds + Machines conference.

Gary Mintchell, chief executive of The Manufacturing Connection, an industrial-internet-focused research and consulting company, said GE’s strategy of using partners reflects the company’s realization that “they can’t build their own ecosystem.”

GE said it was expanding its partnership with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), to provide access to Microsoft applications on Predix. The specifics largely duplicated what the companies said when they first announced the deal in July 2016.

GE said Predix will be available on Azure in North America on Nov. 30, months later than the original target of the second quarter. Predix will still be available on Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services cloud platform, GE said.

GE Digital’s chief executive, Bill Ruh, on Wednesday noted a partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N). GE also is linking Predix with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) IOS operating system for iPhones and iPads.

Patrick Franklin, vice president in charge of Predix, said there was still room to improve Predix after the company held a two-month time-out this year to fix bugs, but the platform was showing near-100 percent stability.

“We are paying careful attention to quality,” he said, referring to the delay in deploying Predix on Azure.

GE executives said the company is focusing on developing apps for Predix to boost sales. GE plans to bundle applications for equipment monitoring and service technicians, both of which it bought last year.

GE said orders for Predix were rising sharply. Some customers at the event echoed that view.

Benoit Coeure, who heads the ECB’s market operations, also said the money-printing scheme will continue until inflation “clearly moves” towards the central bank’s objective of just under 2 percent.

The ECB announced on Thursday the quantitative easing (QE) scheme would be extended until September 2018, with its President Mario Draghi -- of whom Coeure was long considered a key ally -- making clear its eventual duration remained open-ended.

Coeure, dropping signals that he was starting to grow impatient with QE, told Le Journal du Dimanche he was hopeful Thursday’s extension would not be repeated.

“Our asset purchases will continue until inflation clearly moves towards 2 percent,” he added.

“This recalibration takes account of the solidity of the (economic) recovery and allows it to gain strength. I am hopeful that this will be the last extension.”

In an interview with Reuters in May, Coeure said “too much gradualism” in winding down the central bank’s bond purchases raised the risk of a market backlash when policy was eventually shifted.

The ECB’s ultra-easy policy, which also includes a sub-zero interest rate, has driven borrowing costs to record lows and boosted property prices in richer euro zone countries including Germany and France.

Coeure acknowledged French companies might be taking on too much debt but said the situation in the euro area as a whole did not warrant a reaction by the ECB, as advocated by critics in Germany.

“In France, corporate debt is also rising very quickly, perhaps too quickly,” he said. “But nothing at this stage demands action from the ECB.”

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Friday ordered a 24-hour suspension of military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq. The two sides held a first round of talks on Friday and Saturday .

Abadi said the talks are meant to prepare for the peaceful deployment of Iraqi troops at the border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria in Iraq’s Kurdistan region.

Clashes broke out between the two sides after Iraqi forces captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk from the Peshmerga, in a surprise offensive ordered by Abadi after the Kurds held an independence referendum in northern Iraq on Sept. 25.

Kirkuk is part of so-called disputed areas, claimed by both the Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq.

“The second round of talks about deploying federal troops in the disputed areas has started,” State TV said, giving no further details.

Abadi wants to take control of the disputed areas and the border crossings, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.

The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution” - a call rejected by Baghdad.

U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country.

The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG’s official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16. But the Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region.

The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by KRG President Masoud Barzani, since it halved the region’s oil export revenue.

The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur and south of their capital, Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides.

Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he was “disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution” and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG “overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution”.

Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,” he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.","Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga start new round of talks, Iraqi State TV says",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-talks/iraqi-forces-kurdish-peshmerga-start-new-round-of-talks-iraqi-state-tv-says-idUKKBN1CY0GD?il=0

Maruti Suzuki’s chairman said there was still no clear roadmap on how the government aimed to achieve its target and a lot would depend on that.

“We will make electric cars but I can’t give you the date just now because it is all very much a work in progress,” R.C. Bhargava told reporters, after the company posted a 3 percent rise in quarterly profit, beating analysts’ estimates.

India is working on a new auto policy that promotes the use of electric cars, and a draft is likely to be made public before the end of the year. This is a shift from an earlier policy that promoted hybrid and electric vehicles.

Sales of electric cars in India remain negligible, however, mainly due to the high cost of batteries which make the vehicles expensive and out of reach for many buyers in a country where cars are as cheap as 250,000 rupees ($3,800). A lack of charging stations also makes the whole proposition unviable for now.

Maruti’s parent, Suzuki Motor Corp, has electric car technology which it can provide, Bhargava said, adding the Japanese company was also in talks with Toyota Motor Corp to form an alliance which may include sharing technologies like hybrid and electric.

Maruti dominates the small car market in India and has been launching more premium vehicles as competition heats up with newer and planned entrants such as Kia Motors and SAIC Motor Corp.

Maruti also manufactures hybrid cars, demand for which has taken a beating after the government raised sales taxes on them to as much as 43 percent. Bhargava said the future of hybrid cars in India would depend on the level of taxes and the company was in talks with the government to lower them.

GROWTH SLOWING

Bhargava said that while the company continued to expect double digit sales growth over the remainder of fiscal 2018, it would slow from the 18 percent posted in the second quarter.

Earlier on Friday, Maruti reported a profit of 24.84 billion rupees ($381.86 million) for the second quarter ended Sept. 30, versus 24.02 billion rupees a year ago, helped by higher sales of compact and utility vehicles. (bit.ly/2xtLHZZ)

Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 22.29 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Maruti, which provides the bulk of Suzuki Motor’s revenues, sold a total of 492,118 vehicles during the quarter, up about 18 percent from a year ago.

Sales of compact vehicles, which include the Swift and Baleno, rose 43.5 percent, while sales of utility vehicles like the Ertiga and Vitara Brezza climbed 27.6 percent.

Islamist group al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attacks on Saturday. A suicide car bomb was rammed into a hotel, Nasahablod Two, about 600 meters from the presidential palace, and then armed militants stormed the building, police said.

A few minutes later, a car bomb exploded near the former parliament house nearby.

Ali Nur, a police officer, told Reuters 17 people, mostly policemen, had died in the blasts.

“Security forces have entered a small portion of the hotel building ... the exchange of gunfire is hellish,” he said.

The police personnel who died had been stationed close to hotel’s gate. The dead also included a former lawmaker, he said.

Fighting continued to rage inside the hotel after the blast and police said the death toll was likely to rise.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, told Reuters the emergency service had carried 17 people injured from the hotel bombing.

A huge cloud of smoke rose over the scene and a Reuters witness saw over a dozen wrecked cars and bloodstains in front of the hotel. Sporadic gunfire could be heard.

Islamist group al Shabaab, responsible for scores of such attacks in the country’s long civil war, said it carried out Saturday’s bombings.

“We targeted ministers and security officials who were inside the hotel. We are fighting inside,” Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group’s military operations spokesman, told Reuters.

He said the hotel belonged to Somalia’s internal security minister, Mohamed Abukar Islow.

Al Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia’s internationally-backed government and impose its strict interpretation of Islam’s sharia law.

Bombs in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed at least 358 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history, igniting nationwide outrage.

Another 56 people are still missing, believed to have been burnt without a trace. Al Shabaab was widely suspected, but has not claimed responsibility after thousands of Somalis poured onto the streets to protest.

Al Shabaab’s attacks are growing in frequency and size, as a 22,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force prepares to begin withdrawing.

The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX is up nearly 6 percent from its August lows as the Trump administration has rolled out its tax reform proposal, which would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from the current 35 percent and allow companies to bring back some of the $2.6 trillion in cash currently held offshore at reduced rates.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that a positive boost from taxes “had been priced out of stocks” in July but “has been making a solid comeback.”

Yet there are signs that the Trump administration has little room for error as it gets ready to introduce its tax legislation next week. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget measure on Thursday necessary for a vote on a tax bill, with Republicans from such high-tax states as New York and New Jersey among the opponents out of concerns that a bill would eliminate the deduction of state and local taxes.

Trump must also stem potential revolts over a proposal to scale back the level of tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans, which many middle-class Americans rely on for their retirement.

“The nature of the rally over the last two months has been tax-cut led. If we don’t get a cut then the market is going down” several percentage points, said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.

Such a decline would be the first significant sell-off of the year, he said, but would not likely be near the 20 percent decline that signifies the start of a bear market.

A collapse in the tax measure would likely send the S&P 500 down 5 percent or more, Goldman Sachs said in an Oct. 20 note.

“Tax reform will determine the direction of the S&P 500’s next 100 points,” the report said.

Over the last 30 days, roughly 75 companies - ranging from delivery service United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) - have discussed how they would benefit from a corporate tax cut on conference calls with analysts, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings call transcripts, a sign that Wall Street is increasingly focused on the tax bill.

The White House’s plan would boost 2018 S&P 500 adjusted earnings per share by 12 percent, to $156, Goldman Sachs estimates, while leading to an additional $75 billion in stock buybacks.

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said that Trump’s clashes over the last week with members of his own party could threaten the tax bill’s success because it could alienate other Republicans. Because Republicans hold only a slim 52-48 seat advantage in the Senate, Trump can afford to lose only two votes.

“When the possibility of a defection of some Republican senators increases, that kind of puts the whole tax reform thing in jeopardy. He needs them all,” Tuz said.

At the same time, the 14.4 percent year-to-date rally in the S&P 500 leaves the index primed for a decline of at least 5 percent, said Barry James, a co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund (GLRBX.O).

The S&P 500 trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 22.6, and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, both well above their historical norms.

“We’re at levels today that are historically very risky for stocks and we’re primed for a correction,” James said. “If there’s not the tax cut that everyone is expecting, then the correction could be a whole lot more serious.”","As Trump tax comes to floor, failure could spell stocks selloff",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/as-trump-tax-comes-to-floor-failure-could-spell-stocks-selloff-idUSKBN1CW1EV

The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug.

CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No. 3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday. It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize.

If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.

“It’s an alternate model at this point. It’s not clear that it’s definitely a better one,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said. “More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.”

For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.

But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies.

UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.

Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path. It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years. That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.

CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp. If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cigna’s interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.

Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.

The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.

Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.

SWINGING PENDULUM

Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.

Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.

UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.

Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.

Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.

But with those profits in hand, and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending, they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits, Leerink’s Gupta said.

Another potential lure of a deal for Aetna would be to capitalize on the growing number of simple health services offered in a CVS store, from flu shots to blood pressure checks. Reimbursing such patient care outside of a doctor’s office or hospital could cut healthcare costs, Gupta said.",CVS bid for Aetna: A $66 billion bet on cutting drug costs,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-healthcare-insurers/cvs-bid-for-aetna-a-66-billion-bet-on-cutting-drug-costs-idUKKBN1CY0EG

The company’s shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.

Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.

“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.

“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”

The company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

FILE PHOTO: An attendee checks out a new iPhone X during an Apple launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam

Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades.

Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday. The base price for the phone is $999.

He noted that Sprint Corp’s iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.

However, electronics retailer Best Buy Co is charging shoppers an extra $100, if they wish to buy an unactivated iPhone X outright.

If customers order the phone on an installment billing plan, they will pay the same price charged by Apple and the carriers.

“Our prices reflect the fact that no matter a customer’s desired plan or carrier, or whether a customer is on a business or personal plan, they are able to get a phone the way they want at Best Buy,” Best Buy spokeswoman Carly Charlson said.

“Our customers have told us they want this flexibility and sometimes that has a cost.”",Apple says iPhone X pre-orders are 'off the charts',https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-iphone/apple-says-iphone-x-pre-orders-are-off-the-charts-idINKBN1CW28K

A blockbuster deal with Airbus SE (AIR.PA) that saw the European company take control of the CSeries for $1 leaves Bombardier’s commercial aviation division with the soft-selling turboprop and regional jets lines.

Meanwhile, on the rail side, Bombardier recently lost out on a merger with Germany’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and now faces off against China’s merged rail company CRRC Corp (601766.SS) and a soon-to-be-formed European giant in Siemens-Alstom.

Macquarie on Friday said it would tweak 2019 company valuations to focus on corporate jets and rail, in the wake of the Airbus deal and media speculation on further commercial aircraft sales.

While the Airbus partnership boosts the CSeries and potentially Bombardier’s small aerostructures and engineering division, which produces aircraft components, the remaining lines in its commercial aerospace arm are “mature and stay stable at best as the industry changes around them,” according to AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray.

Removal of the CSeries headache means the company can focus on its more profitable rail and business jet divisions.

Yet even there, concerns remain with Moody’s this week downgrading Bombardier partly on “longer-term concerns” about the competitiveness of its rail business and concerns about its “future in the commercial aircraft space.” Bombardier said Moody’s action was “ill-founded.”

Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said recently the firm continues to weigh options for the rail unit. Asked about the future of the commercial aerospace unit on Oct. 20, he told reporters, “Right now the focus is to keep on selling these aircraft.”

“I think they will be forced to take a decision (to) either fix, coast or sell,” U.S. analyst Richard Aboulafia said of the commercial plane unit. “But fix means putting some serious money into product upgrades.”

Upgrading a regional jet with a new engine and wings would cost upwards of $1 billion, an amount likely to be prohibitive for the company as it spends on ramping up its CSeries and bringing its strong-selling Global 7000 to market, analysts say.

Bombardier has long weighed a sale or partnership venture to boost orders for its Q400 prop planes, which trail European rival ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo SpA (LDOF.MI). Such a deal, however, would be complicated by the need to ensure Canadian job security because the aircraft are assembled in Canada, government and union sources said.

Bombardier tried unsuccessfully in 2013 to sell 100 Q400 turboprops in Russia and set up a joint-venture assembly line there.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

Mohammad Nabi Ahmadi had crossed over from Afghanistan into Pakistan with his brother and was walking down a road in the northwestern city of Peshawar when a car with tinted windows pulled up and overpowered the Afghan official, according to a Peshawar police source.

The police source said Ahmadi’s brother recounted the episode to Pakistani police, but did not disclose that his brother was a high-ranking Afghan provincial government official.

“It was afterwards we came to know from other sources that he was deputy governor of Kunar,” said the police official.

Abdul Ghani Musamem, the spokesman for the governor of Kunar, confirmed Ahmadi had gone missing in Peshawar on Friday and added that he had been on leave for medical treatment.

Wealthy Afghans frequently cross the border for medical treatment in Pakistan. Many Afghans live in Peshawar and it is also common for influential figures in Afghanistan to have business or family links in the Pashtun regions of Pakistan.

The Pakistani police source said the Afghan government had not told them about Ahmadi’s visit, adding that “otherwise we would have provided him with security”.

Another security official said police in Peshawar were working to find out if Ahmadi’s kidnapping was related to his work or a personal dispute.

The Afghan Taliban denied involvement in Ahmadi’s kidnapping.

Initial estimates show GDP expanded at an annualized rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, despite the effect of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. An increase in goods made but not sold helped, but so did global growth and healthy corporate earnings. Protectionist policies could put the trend at risk.

Third-quarter growth was a pleasant surprise after economists projected expansion of 2.5 percent. Growth in consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic output, slowed down to 2.4 percent but is expected to rebound as the effects of the hurricane fade. And rising inventories contributed just over 0.7 percentage points to growth, in what could be a sign that companies think consumer demand will warm up.

There are other positive signs. Business investment, which had been lagging but improved in recent months, came in at a healthy 3.9 percent. Exports increased by 2.3 percent in their third quarter, which added more than 0.4 percentage points to economic growth. It’s aided by global expansion, with world economic growth in sync for the first time in years and Europe catching up with the United States. The International Monetary Fund projected the global economy would get a 3.6 percent boost in 2017 and grow by 3.7 percent the following year.

President Donald Trump has promised to cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent – but whether or not he succeeds, companies are performing well. The Nasdaq reached a record high on Friday morning after tech groups from Amazon to Microsoft reported robust third quarter earnings. On top of that, the United States is nearly at full employment with a jobless rate of 4.2 percent.

Past form suggests Trump will take credit. True, the nearly 20 percent rise in the S&P 500 since his election is partly due to the hope of tax cuts. But most of the positive economic trends are occurring without major legislative accomplishments. The biggest risk to this outlook is harmful trade policies, including a disintegration of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for which negotiations aren’t going well.

Investors wiped more than 10 percent, or slightly more than $9 billion, from the web giant’s market value in late U.S. trading on Thursday after it forecast disappointing sales for the rest of 2017. Baidu has cut costs and narrowed its focus to revitalise its search business. Unfortunately, that has yet to translate into less volatile results.

The search-engine operator said it expects revenue for the three months to December to be between 22.2 billion yuan and 23.4 billion yuan. At the midpoint, that’s a hefty 25 percent uplift on the same period a year earlier. But expectations matter, especially in growth industries, and this was about 8 percent less than what analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting. Shares of the U.S.-listed Baidu duly tumbled.

The timing is awkward: Baidu’s main search unit has just started to recover after it was hit by a scandal last year over dubious medical advertising. Still, this looks like a one-off.

That is because the recent sale of an unprofitable food-delivery unit has depressed overall sales. But growth in its core business still looks strong. Helped by news feeds on its mobile app, advertising sales in the three months to September topped 20.1 billion yuan, up 22 percent from a year earlier.

Baidu is also more focused than it has been in years. After ill-judged forays into movie ticketing, delivering takeaways and other “online-to-offline” services, Baidu is shifting resources back to the search app. It is slashing other operating expenses, which is helping lift operating margins.

Yet investors remain jumpy. Before Thursday’s sell-off, shares of Baidu had rallied 59 percent this year. In absolute terms that is impressive, but that performance lags arch-rivals Tencent and Alibaba by 24 and 35 percentage points respectively. More predictability would help regain investors’ trust.",Breakingviews - China's Baidu stumbles in getting back to basics,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baidu-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-baidu-stumbles-in-getting-back-to-basics-idUSKBN1CW0AP

The moves will be made during the country’s annual meeting of parliament early next year, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party’s anti-graft watchdog, said in its report to a five-yearly party congress last week.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.",Scooters instead of boardroom 'kabuki': how one fund manager picks winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-greenlightmasters/scooters-instead-of-boardroom-kabuki-how-one-fund-manager-picks-winners-idUSKBN1930DA

The investment bank, which UBS has scaled back in recent years to free up resources for wealth management, saw adjusted pretax operating profit rise 2.9 percent to 352 million francs.
A drop in the second quarter CET1 ratio had been a source of concern for some investors.
“That ratio is clearly good for all those who want to make a dividend story out of UBS,” said Brun.","ZURICH (Reuters) - A pick-up at UBS’s (UBSG.S) core wealth management business is likely to weaken in the final months of 2017 as clients withdraw money to take part in tax amnesty programs, the world’s biggest private bank said.

UBS, which manages more than more than $2 trillion of the world’s wealth, saw continued improvement in the third quarter at its flagship business after a sluggish 2016 in which trading activity by rich clients hit a record low.

But finance chief Kirt Gardner said the fourth quarter, traditionally a seasonally slow three months, would be hit by an estimated 8 billion Swiss francs ($8 billion) in withdrawals as wealthy customers participate in government programs to declare offshore assets.

“We would expect that after the outflows in the fourth quarter you will see a drop-off in recurring revenue as a consequence and also reduction in margin,” he said in a call with analysts on Friday.

Gardner added UBS expected to see a recovery by the second quarter of 2018.

The bank, which also has investment banking, asset management, and Swiss retail and corporate divisions, said political and monetary policy uncertainty made it cautious too.

Third-quarter group net profit came in at 946 million francs, lagging the average forecast in a Reuters survey of six analysts but ahead of the Swiss bank’s own poll.

UBS shares were down 1.1 percent at 1120 GMT, a steeper drop than the European banking sector index .SX7P.

‘EXPECTING A LOT’

Net new money inflows - a closely watched indicator of future earnings in money management - totaled 4.6 billion francs at UBS’s international wealth management unit in the third quarter.

A bright spot for the unit was the contribution from Asia Pacific, a priority growth region for UBS which has seen its best ever year-to-date performance.

UBS’s North America brokerage business, which handles just over half the bank’s wealth management assets, saw net outflows of $2.3 billion, a blow to a business investors hope is on an upward curve.

“The market is expecting a lot from wealth management Americas because of the good economy and the rate increases,” said Mirabaud Securities Limited analyst Andreas Brun, who rates UBS’s stock “buy”.

The investment bank, which UBS has scaled back in recent years to free up resources for wealth management, saw adjusted pretax operating profit rise 2.9 percent to 352 million francs.

UBS’s common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, an important measure of balance sheet strength which UBS uses to help decide its dividend, rose to 13.7 percent from 13.5 percent in the second quarter. A drop in the second quarter CET1 ratio had been a source of concern for some investors.

However, Brun said pending legal cases and the uncertainty over future capital rules under Basel IV regulations meant it was too soon to draw conclusions for the dividend.

“That ratio is clearly good for all those who want to make a dividend story out of UBS,” said Brun. “For me it’s still too early to call it a dividend story.”",UBS cautions gains from wealthy client activity may not last,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubs-group-ag-results/ubs-cautions-gains-from-wealthy-client-activity-may-not-last-idUSKBN1CW0QC?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug.

CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No. 3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday. It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize.

If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.

“It’s an alternate model at this point. It’s not clear that it’s definitely a better one,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said. “More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.”

For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.

But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies.

UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.

Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path. It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years. That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.

CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp. If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cigna’s interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.

Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.

The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.

Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.

SWINGING PENDULUM

Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.

Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.

UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.

Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.

Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.

But with those profits in hand, and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending, they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits, Leerink’s Gupta said.

Another potential lure of a deal for Aetna would be to capitalize on the growing number of simple health services offered in a CVS store, from flu shots to blood pressure checks. Reimbursing such patient care outside of a doctor’s office or hospital could cut healthcare costs, Gupta said.",CVS bid for Aetna: A $66 billion bet on cutting drug costs,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-insurers/cvs-bid-for-aetna-a-66-billion-bet-on-cutting-drug-costs-idUSKBN1CY0EI

The auto safety agency said in a report that it wants to find any “unnecessary regulatory barriers” to self-driving cars “particularly those that are not equipped with controls for a human driver.”

The agency also wants comments on what research it needs to conduct before deciding whether to eliminate or rewrite regulations. But it could take the agency years to complete the research and finalize rule changes, and advocates are pushing Congress to act.

NHTSA said in a statement it plans to issue a formal notice in the “near future requesting comment” on the hurdles. The agency hopes to make the notice public by the end of November.

Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. The agency said last year that current regulations pose “significant” regulatory hurdles to vehicles without human controls.

In early October, a U.S. Senate committee unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls and would allow the agency to waive requirements.

General Motors Co (GM.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes.

The Senate Commerce Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from NHTSA for safety rules for up to 80,000 vehicles annually within three years.

Clauses that keep customers out of the courts have caused reputational problems for Wall Street before, and will again.

Industry lobbying paid off when the Senate overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on Tuesday night. The measure was proposed by Richard Cordray, the head of the CFPB appointed by former President Barack Obama, who argued consumers need protection from fine print forcing them to rely on private arbitration, which often favors the firms, when they feel they have been wronged. Banks said the CFPB rule would increase costs for consumers.

Their celebration could be short lived. Credit-scoring agency Equifax had to drop its arbitration clause for 145.5 million consumers affected by a data breach disclosed in September, after public pressure and threats from state attorneys general. And after U.S. lender Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million unauthorized accounts for customers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers slammed the bank for wanting to settle disputes through arbitration.

Before the vote, the industry had been largely enjoying a respite from the wrath of Democrats and other critics in Washington. Wall Street wasn’t even mentioned in the Democratic platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Instead, the party focused on big tech companies like Facebook, questioning whether they need further antitrust regulations.

China’s CCCC International Holding Ltd said on Thursday it intended to buy Aecon for C$1.51 billion ($1.18 billion), a deal that requires Ottawa’s approval under the Investment Canada Act.

Trudeau told a news conference in Quebec that Ottawa would examine the implications for intellectual property protections.

“In the case of this proposed Aecon purchase, certainly the Investment Canada Act will be applied in full and we will look very, very carefully at security issues, at economic impacts, at whether or not this is truly in the national interest,” he said.

Canada, citing national security needs, places strict restrictions on the Canadian assets that China and other nations can buy.

Canada recently encouraged plane maker Bombardier to sell control of its CSeries jet to European rival Airbus SE rather strike a deal with a Chinese firm. Ottawa sources said one reason was what some officials see as inadequate Chinese safeguards against intellectual property theft.

Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement.

He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,” Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.

The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.

Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.

“You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?” Rouhani said.

“Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.

IAEA HEAD VISITS

Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.

“Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,” it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.

“For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.”

Trump’s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano’s agency is in charge of policing.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal.

Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano: “He has no request in this area,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America’s preferred course.","Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear-missiles/rouhani-says-iran-will-keep-producing-missiles-state-tv-reports-idUKKBN1CY04N

“This squad reflects consistency and continuity, while we also rewarded players who have constantly shown good form this season,” Coetzee said in a media statement from South African Rugby on Sunday.

“Warrick and Lukhanyo are two examples of players who have excelled in the season so far. It’s great to have them in the squad and I look forward to working with them.”

Coetzee said the squad had been selected with an eye on the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.

“With the World Cup now less than two years away, this demanding tour gives us another very good opportunity to keep on building depth and experience,” he said.

“Eight new players were capped so far this season and a total of 19 new international players (have) made their Springbok debuts since the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

“Our process to rebuild the Bok team and steadily work towards the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan is continuing at a good and satisfying pace.”

Lock Eben Etzebeth will continue to lead the side in the absence of Whiteley, but the squad will be without Jan Serfontein, who asked not to be considered for the tour as he wants to settle in at French club Montpellier.

Siya Kolisi will return to Cape Town after the test against France in Paris on Nov. 18 as his wife, Rachel, is due to give birth the following week.

He will not be available for the Test against Italy on Nov. 25 in Padua, but will re-join the group for the final tour match in Cardiff against Wales the following week.

Players who are contracted to overseas clubs –- lock Franco Mostert, loose forward Francois Louw and flyhalf Elton Jantjies –- will not be considered for selection for the game against Wales as this test falls outside the international window.

The Boks start their tour against Ireland on Nov. 11.

The moves will be made during the country’s annual meeting of parliament early next year, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party’s anti-graft watchdog, said in its report to a five-yearly party congress last week.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

Picture taken on June 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mark Blinch

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

Current production limits have already been extended once, from the end of June 2017 to give more time for the oil market to rebalance.

Ministers and officials are now discussing lengthening the agreement again, possibly until the end of 2018 (“OPEC seeking consensus on oil supply cut extension before meeting”, Reuters, Oct. 19).

OECD crude oil inventories were still almost 160 million barrels above their five-year average in September, though the surplus has already narrowed by nearly 180 million barrels since the start of the year.

On current trends, inventories will not have normalised by the end of March, and OPEC is keen to reassure traders that production limits will be extended until the process is completed.

OPEC and its allies have been engaged in a form of forward guidance, borrowing from the central banking sector, pledging to do “whatever it takes” to bring inventories down to the five-year average.

MEETING SCHEDULE

In the past, OPEC has held multiple ordinary and extraordinary ministerial conferences each year to review and change production policy.

In recent years, however, the organisation has restricted itself to the two ministerial conferences annually required by its statute.

Conferences have typically been held towards the middle and end of each year, normally in May/June and November/December.

And OPEC has generally waited until a production agreement is close to expiry before deciding whether to extend or adjust the deal to preserve the organisation’s flexibility to respond to changing market conditions.

The problem is that the current production agreement expires in March 2018, which is midway between the already scheduled meeting in November 2017 and the next one likely in May or June 2018.

OPEC ministers could agree to meet again in March 2018 to review the agreement and decide on whether to extend or modify it, which would maximise their flexibility.

But they are under pressure from political leaders and oil traders to extend the agreement beyond March to complete the process of inventory normalisation.

The most important participants in the negotiation, Saudi Arabia and Russia, have already signalled their interest in extending the agreement beyond March.

So the questions are (1) how long to extend the agreement for and (2) whether to make it explicitly or implicitly conditional on some form of interim review.

EXTENSION OPTIONS

The simplest strategy would be to extend the agreement for three months until the end of June 2018, which would allow it to be reviewed again at the next regular ministerial conference.

The upside of a three-month extension is that it would maximise OPEC’s flexibility as the oil market gets close to balance, and align production limits with OPEC’s regular meeting cycle.

But it would risk disappointing traders and hedge funds who expect OPEC to do “whatever it takes” and are hoping for a bolder and longer commitment to production restraint.

A second strategy is to extend the pact for a full nine months, until the end of December 2018, which would also align the accord with the regular meeting cycle.

A nine-month extension would be bold, underscoring OPEC’s commitment to cutting stocks, but it would limit the organisation’s flexibility significantly.

In effect, OPEC would be committing to hold production unchanged for 12 months (the three unexpired months of the existing agreement and then nine months of extension).

With oil inventories declining steadily, the oil market moving from contango to backwardation, and spot prices on a rising trend, OPEC would risk losing control of the rebalancing process.

Given the current rate of drawdown in crude oil stocks, a 12-month extension would pose a significant risk of inventories and prices overshooting.

So OPEC could try an intermediate strategy: a firm extension for three months to June 2018 with an option to extend the production cuts for a further six months, conditional on market conditions in the middle of 2018.

There are several ways to structure an intermediate strategy, with the mid-year review and option for extension made more or less explicit, depending on what signal ministers want to provide to the market.

If the extension is firm only for three months, with any further extension explicitly conditional on a review at mid-year, there is a risk of disappointing traders and hedge funds, but OPEC would retain maximum flexibility.

Alternatively, OPEC could make the extension firm for nine months, and leave implicit the fact it will be reviewed at mid-year and any decision to prolong it will depend on market conditions at the time.

Ministerial conferences can always review and change production limits in the light of shifting market conditions, but negotiators might choose to leave this unspoken.

OPEC and its allies have also created a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee and an experts group, which carry out more frequent reviews of compliance and market conditions.

So far, the ministerial monitoring committee has not been authorised to recommend intermediate changes in the production deal but it could provide a vehicle for an interim review outside the normal OPEC cycle.

Ministers therefore have lots of options as they consider an extension of the current production pact beyond March 2018.

At some point ministers will also have to consider revised production limits once the current pact expires, which could prove a source of contention since some countries have much more spare capacity and ability to raise output than others.

Difficult decisions on a successor pact may therefore be put off as long as possible.

In the meantime, ministers must balance forward guidance to support prices with retaining flexibility to respond to changing market conditions, which are starting to shift rapidly.",Column: OPEC's options for extending production pact,https://in.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-kemp/column-opecs-options-for-extending-production-pact-idINKBN1CV1UY

The “Greater Jerusalem” legislation would put some settlements in the occupied West Bank, built on land Palestinians seek for a future state and viewed as illegal by most countries, under the jurisdiction of Jerusalem’s municipality.

The bill, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, was to have been submitted for approval on Sunday to a ministerial committee on legislation, a first step before a series of ratification votes in parliament.

But Likud lawmaker David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu’s coalition in parliament, said a vote by the cabinet committee would be delayed because Washington told Israel the bill’s passage could impede U.S. efforts to revive peace talks that collapsed in 2014.

“There is American pressure that claims this is about annexation and that this could interfere with the peace process,” Bitan told Army Radio.

“The prime minister doesn’t think this is about annexation. I don’t think so either. We have to take the time to clarify matters to the Americans. Therefore, if the bill passes in a week, or in a month, it’s less problematic,” he said.

Proponents of the legislation say it falls short of formal land annexation to Israel but will enable some 150,000 settlers to vote in Jerusalem city elections. Intelligence Minister Israel Katz, a supporter of the bill, has said this would “ensure a Jewish majority in a united Jerusalem”.

Israel’s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector it captured along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a 1967 Middle East war, has not won international recognition. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Israeli media reports said the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, had conveyed misgivings about the legislation, under which the large Maale Adumim and Beitar Illit settlements would become part of a Greater Jerusalem municipality.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as telling cabinet ministers on Sunday: “The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was all about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth continuing to talk and coordinate with them.”

A U.S. embassy spokeswoman declined immediate comment.

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

SLIGHT UNIONIST LEAD

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Slideshow (4 Images)

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia-poll/hundreds-of-thousands-march-for-unified-spain-poll-shows-depths-of-division-idUSKBN1CY072?il=0

The adults and teenagers of “Stranger Things 2” wrestle emotionally with the events of the first season: a town boy’s disappearance, a death, a mysterious girl with superpowers and a decaying parallel universe called the Upside Down.

“We wanted that trauma to really run through the entire season so it’s about these characters confronting the horrors,” said Matt Duffer, one half of the Duffer Brothers, the twins who created the show.

All nine episodes of “Stranger Things 2” will be released on Friday.

At the center of the show are its young teenage breakout stars. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) suffers worsening visions of the Upside Down after being rescued, forcing his friends to try to find a way to defeat the demon known as Demogorgon.

Eleven, the innocent, tormented young girl with superpowers played by Emmy-nominated 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is believed dead and is in hiding, staying with the town’s police chief, Jim Hopper. Frustrated at being kept away from her friends, Eleven clashes with Hopper (David Harbour) and embarks on a mission to find her mother and finally find a home.

“We wanted (Eleven) to go through her own journey in a way that was much more personal to her and wasn’t tied to the boys,” Matt Duffer said. “We wanted her to go through a journey of self-discovery without the help of anyone else.”

“Stranger Things” has become a phenomenon for Netflix Inc, landing Emmy wins and drawing a cadre of obsessed fans who launched a viral online campaign, #JusticeForBarb, sparked by the gruesome demise of supporting character Barb Holland.

The second season ramps up the quest to bring closure to her death while introducing new characters and expanding the story geographically.

The Duffers said they anticipate five seasons to bring “Stranger Things” to a conclusion.

“It was important to us this season to start to move out of Hawkins and to introduce this world,” said Ross Duffer.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

“At least we have something left,” he said, standing in a room with clothes, toys, ornaments and damaged pictures strewn across the floor.

“Others have nothing. They lost their homes, they lost their lives.”

Ismail, 44, the Imam of a nearby mosque, considers himself one of the luckiest people in Marawi. The city was devastated by more than 150 days of battles between government forces and pro-Islamic State militants that killed more than 1,100 people and displaced some 350,000.

His house is in Marawi’s safe zone, an area long abandoned by residents but untouched by unrelenting shelling and military air strikes that have all but flattened the city’s commercial heart, destroying thousands of homes, shops and vehicles.

Six days after troops killed the last remaining rebels, Ismail was among about 4,000 people allowed to return to their homes on Sunday in Marawi’s Basak Malutlot area.

Many like him have discovered their houses were looted and left in disarray.

“I opened the door and I was shocked, but I‘m still happy to be home,” he said.

Ismail fled with his family on May 24 during a fierce three-day firefight that erupted just 50 meters away, when security forces tried to raid the hideout of notorious militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State’s anointed “emir” in Southeast Asia.

Hapilon escaped, then issued a call to arms to hundreds of insurgents to initiate their planned takeover of Marawi. It sparked the Philippines’ biggest urban battle in recent history, and fears that Islamic State’s extremist agenda had gained a foothold in the south of the mainly Catholic country.

HAPPY HOMECOMING

There were scenes of joy and chaos as a convoy of returning residents poured in to Marawi to a cacophony of horns and whistles, jamming what only a few hours earlier were deserted streets.

Armed police at checkpoints cross-checked documents and pictures of each passengers from the 712 families, to guard against possible infiltration by militants.

The rival projections reflected the many unknowns swirling around the plan, expected to be unveiled in legislative form on Wednesday. Republicans were still undecided on some of the hardest parts, such as how to pay for the costly cuts proposed.

Weeks and possibly months of debate lie ahead for a project that Trump promised to tackle in his 2016 election campaign. In September, he unveiled a rough framework for cutting taxes. Now he wants Congress to approve a bill, which would mark his first major legislative victory, before the end of the year.

The Trump plan for tax cuts of the sort normally reserved for times of economic recession is taking shape in Congress amid signs the economy is already growing briskly.

Gross domestic product increased at a 3 percent annual rate in the July-September period, supported by strong business spending on equipment, the Commerce Department said on Friday.

The economic recovery begun under former President Barack Obama after the 2007-2009 recession is in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue amid a tightening labor market.

“It’s hard to say that we need to have tax cuts at the individual level ... you don’t need to provide further fiscal stimulus when the economy is already strong,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey.

Faced with improving economic prospects, Republicans have shifted their rhetoric on tax cuts away from getting the economy moving again to keeping it on an expansion track.

An analysis released by White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said slashing the top federal corporate tax rate and letting businesses write off the full cost of most capital investments immediately, as proposed in the plan, would bring faster growth and higher wages.

Hassett’s projections envisioned a 3 percent to 5 percent increase in GDP that, over 10 years, could represent an additional $700 billion to $1.2 trillion in economic output.

But the Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit Washington think tank, released an analysis that concluded the Trump tax plan would not produce a significant, permanent economic boost.

The group said the plan would reduce federal tax revenue by roughly $2.4 trillion over the next decade and by over $3 trillion in the decade after that, adding significantly to a U.S. national debt that already exceeds $20.4 trillion.

The center said Trump’s tax cuts would drive new activity at first, but that the impact would be blunted in later years by rising deficits, forcing more federal borrowing to finance the tax cuts and driving up borrowing costs for the private sector.

Hassett told reporters he does not expect tax reform to add significantly to the deficit. But he conceded that it would become “a big negative” if economic growth failed to materialize and the debt level soared.

The framework of Trump’s plan unveiled last month called for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the small business rate to 25 percent from up to 39.6 percent and the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent.

It also called specifically for repealing the estate tax on inheritances and the alternative minimum tax, both of which are typically paid by the country’s highest-income earners.

Less clear were the plan’s proposals to reduce the number of tax brackets, enhance the child tax credit and possibly put new limits on popular 401(k) retirement pension plans.

Because details of the unfinished tax legislation are unknown, its economic impact is unclear, said Omer Eisner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

Hours after the Commerce Department reported stronger-than-expected third quarter U.S. economic growth of 3 percent. Hassett said the data did not undercut the need for tax cuts.

He said economic expansion and stronger stock market performance could be undermined if the Republican-controlled Congress fails to enact the tax cuts.

“Firms are optimistic both because of regulatory reform but also because they expect corporate tax reform and overall tax reform,” Hassett said. “The thing that I‘m worried about is that if those expectations prove to be incorrect, then I would expect business capital spending to go back to a disappointing path and equity markets to decline as well.”

Kevin Brady, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives tax committee, said progress was being made toward satisfying Republicans who have held back support for the tax plan because it could end a deduction for state and local taxes. “I‘m hopeful ... we can find a good solution for them,” Brady said.",Rosy White House tax cut forecast clashes with independent analysis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/rosy-white-house-tax-cut-forecast-clashes-with-independent-analysis-idUSKBN1CW30T

Domino, who for a while was mistakenly thought to have been killed when Hurricane Katrina devastated his New Orleans neighborhood in 2005, died at home on Tuesday of natural causes, the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office said.

As one of the pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll in the 1950s, Domino sold 65 million records - more than anyone in that period except Elvis Presley, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He had dozens of songs on the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts, including “Blueberry Hill,” “Ain’t That a Shame,” “Blue Monday,” “I‘m Walkin’,” “Whole Lotta Loving,” “Hello, Josephine,” “Walking to New Orleans,” “I‘m Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day” and “Let the Four Winds Blow.”

“For lack of a better way of putting it, he’s a living, walking legend among us in New Orleans,” singer Irma Thomas told the New York Times in 2007. “Between him and Louis Armstrong, they were the first big names to put us on the musical map.”

Antoine Dominique Domino was born on Feb. 26, 1928 in New Orleans and one of nine children. A brother-in-law taught him piano, leading to a style that mixed the classic New Orleans sound with blues, country and Cajun music. He was performing in nightclubs while still a teenager and soon teamed with trumpet player Dave Bartholomew, who would become his co-writer and producer and help refine his piano style.

His nickname was attributed to his short, squatty stature, as well as a tribute to two other pianists - Fats Waller and New Orleans native Fats Pichon.

Like contemporaries Little Richard and Chuck Berry, Domino was a black performer whose music crossed over to white audiences and helped shape early rock.

His first hit was an R&B song, the autobiographical “The Fat Man,” recorded in 1949 and considered among the first songs in the rock ‘n’ roll genre.

DOMINO EFFECT

Also like Little Richard, one of his biggest hits, “Ain’t That a Shame,” was later recorded by Pat Boone, a white singer, whose version received more radio airplay. A live version of the song by the rock band Cheap Trick was a hit in 1978.

Domino would be a huge influence on rockers who came after him - John Lennon told a New York radio station that “Ain’t That a Shame” was the first song he learned to play - but his prominence began to wane after the British invasion and other forms of rock took root in the 1960s.

Harry Connick Jr., from a later generation of New Orleans musicians, said on Twitter, “You helped pave the way for New Orleans piano players... see you on top of that blueberry hill in the sky.” Guitarist Vernon Reid of the band Living Color mourned Domino’s death by tweeting, “Rock & Roll lost part of it’s soul.”

In his later years Domino was reluctant to perform and rarely left his beloved hometown, but he did go to Indianola, Mississippi, in 2015 to play “Amazing Grace” at B.B. King’s funeral.

Domino was a longtime resident of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward - the section of the city hit hardest by Katrina’s floodwaters - and had resisted early pleas to evacuate as the hurricane approached. For a time he was believed to have died in the flooding and the words “R.I.P. Fats You will be missed” were spray-painted on his house, which was flooded up to the roof.

It was later learned that Domino and his family had been rescued by boat and taken to the refugee center set up at the Superdome in the city before going to Baton Rouge. They lost most of their possessions in the flood but managed to save Domino’s couch, which was custom-made from the rear end of a vintage pink Cadillac.

After Katrina, he moved to a New Orleans suburb to live with his daughter.

The Recording Industry of America late gave Domino reproductions to replace the 20 gold record awards he lost. His Grammy Awards also were replaced and President George W. Bush visited Domino to give him a new National Medal of the Arts.

Domino titled his 2006 album “Alive and Kickin’” and proceeds went to help rebuild New Orleans and preserve its musical heritage.

With margins squeezed by a stagnant domestic market and rivalry from China and South Korea, many factories have cut costs, reducing their reliance on workers in lifetime employment in favor of laborers on temporary contracts.

As they have done so, safety scandals have erupted across the country’s much-vaunted manufacturing sector, with Subaru Corp on Friday joining Nissan Motor Co Ltd in admitting it failed to follow proper vehicle inspection procedures.

Earlier this month, Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, Kobe Steel Ltd, said its workers had tampered with product specifications for years, leaving companies around the world scrambling to verify the safety of cars, planes, trains and electrical goods.

Unable to easily lay off “regular” employees, full-time employees with permanent contracts and pay scales based on seniority that formed the heart of Japan’s post-war workforce, companies have increasingly come to rely on “non-regular” workers - temps, part-timers and short-term contract workers.

These non-regular workers allow companies to cut costs and adjust their workforce, said Koji Morioka, emeritus professor at Kansai University and an expert on workplace issues. But it has led to a de-skilling of the factory floor, lowering standards and increasing the likelihood of wrongdoing and accidents, he said.

“The use of these ‘disposable’ workers is greatly increasing,” Morioka said. “The loss of experienced, skilled workers on the factory floor is becoming more and more risky.”

The share of non-regular workers in the labor force has risen from 20 percent in the early 1990s to a record 37.5 percent last year - with the proportion in some companies higher still.

The pay gap is stark, with regular workers last year on average paid 321,700 yen ($2,830) monthly compared with 211,800 yen for contract workers.

Companies are failing to produce the skilled workers needed to ensure standards are met in areas like safety at a time when scrutiny is intensifying around the world and lapses are met with greater criticism, said Parissa Haghirian, professor of Japanese management at Sophia University in Tokyo.

“There is a real human resource problem,” she said, with the traditional model of hiring workers straight out of school or university, teaching them on the job and rotating them between departments no longer functioning well.

AFTERTHOUGHT

With the ratio of companies complaining of labor shortages at a 25-year high and with firms needing specialists but failing to produce them internally, competition for skilled workers is likely to become more fierce, Haghirian said.

“I predict high performers will leave more quickly... leaving companies in trouble because these people traditionally would stay and drag everyone else along,” she said.

Japanese companies are not alone in being caught up in scandals, with European and U.S. companies caught cutting corners and manipulating results in areas like vehicle emissions tests to the sale of meat. But the Japanese firms face questions over whether they can adapt quickly enough.

Some Japanese makers have taken the attitude that “because the factory floor is well run, quality control and inspection can be applied as an afterthought,” said Tadashi Kunihiro, a lawyer who is a director and auditor on company boards.

Companies, he said, were not placing their most skilled workers in quality control roles.

While safety lapses have been going on at some companies for years or even decades, the decline of the lifetime employment system has likely sapped the loyalty of workers who are more likely to raise concerns themselves, Kunihiro added.

Improving transparency at companies has been a key plank of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s corporate governance reforms through measures such as boosting the number of outside directors.

But experts question whether such reforms can do much to prevent safety scandals occurring in the first place.

“Even if there are more outside directors, if there is cheating on the factory floor there is no way they will be able find out,” a senior executive in the aluminum industry said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

“Even executives don’t know what’s happening on the factory floor,” he said.

Executives are guilty of becoming too detached from the operational side of the business, said Toshiyuki Shimegi, president of Porsche Japan.

“There is a need for more micromanagement,” he said on the sidelines of the Tokyo Motor Show. “They are missing the hands-on approach.”",Japan Inc.'s safety failures point to deeper malaise,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kobe-steel-scandal-workers-analysis/japan-inc-s-safety-failures-point-to-deeper-malaise-idUSKBN1CY05B

A growing number of Canadians identifying themselves as indigenous, a higher fertility rate and a higher life expectancy for indigenous people than in the past help explain the rapid growth rate, Statistics Canada said.

Canada’s indigenous population grew 42.5 percent in the 10 years to 2016 to 1.7 million people, compared to 11 percent growth for Canada as a whole, Statistics Canada said, in data released from the 2016 census.

The findings show a young population, with an average age of 32.1 years, compared with 40.9 for the non-aboriginal population.

The census, which showed indigenous people accounting for nearly 5 percent of the population overall, also found a younger generation significantly more likely to be raised in foster care. Indigenous children made up 7.7 percent of all Canadians under 5 but more than half of the children were in foster homes, according to the census data.

The census also found that one fifth of the indigenous population lives in over-crowded housing, and 44 percent of indigenous people on reserves were living in homes that needed major repairs.

Last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada had failed its indigenous people. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Trudeau acknowledged the dark history of Canada’s colonization as one of “humiliation, neglect and abuse” and promised to do more.

Statistics Canada estimated that by 2036, indigenous people will comprise one-fifth of the populations of the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan - potentially giving them greater political clout.

Canada’s indigenous people come from hundreds of nations and bands, with more than 70 distinct languages. They include First Nations, Métis, people of mixed indigenous and European background, and Inuit, who largely inhabit Canada’s north.

Population growth between 2006 and 2016 was highest for Métis, at 51.2 percent. That appeared to result, at least in part, from more people calling themselves Métis rather than from a mushrooming Métis birth rate, Statistics Canada figures suggest.

In 2011, Métis women’s birth rate was just 12.5 percent higher than that of non-indigenous women.

“I think these are people who are kind of dipping their toe into these identity waters,” said Chris Andersen, a professor and dean of Native Studies at the University of Alberta.",Canada's indigenous population undergoes dramatic growth: census,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CU2NK-OCADN

Italian Dovizioso overtook team mate Jorge Lorenzo with four laps remaining to claim his sixth win of the campaign at Sepang circuit and give Ducati a 1-2 finish for the first time this year.

Johann Zarco grabbed third on his non-works Yamaha, nursing a soft rear tyre to the finish, frustrating Marquez’s hopes of sealing his fourth MotoGP title with a race to spare.

Dovizioso’s win is only likely to stall the championship leader’s triumph for another two weeks as Honda-riding Marquez will take a 21-point lead over the Italian into the final race in Valencia.

Reigning champion Marquez moved to 282 points and with 25 up for grabs in Spain, should wrap up the title if his bike stays on two wheels.

Stranger things have happened, however, and 31-year-old Dovizioso was not ruling out his chances of a maiden title.

“Everything can happen during the weekend, and you never know about the weather,” he told reporters.

“We know it’s difficult but we are relaxed. We are going to Valencia in a relaxed way and will try to do the maximum.”

Dovizioso started third on the grid behind pole-sitter Dani Pedrosa yet it was Marquez charging into the lead with a brilliant start from seventh.

He was forced to turn wide, however, and fell quickly back to third behind Zarco and Lorenzo.

Dovizioso had the roughest start but roared past Marquez on the fourth lap and kept the Spaniard at bay thereafter.

Lorenzo made his move on Zarco midway through the 20-lap race and Dovizioso followed him moments later, leaving the two Ducatis to duel for the win.

With Marquez holding down fourth behind Zarco, Dovizioso needed to deal with his three-times world champion team mate to be assured of taking the title fight to Valencia.

With the controversial whiff of team orders in the muggy Malaysian air, Dovizioso drew ever closer to Lorenzo and was gifted the lead with four laps to go when the Spaniard skidded at turn 15 and very nearly came to grief.

Dovizioso swept past and held on for a 0.743 second-win, perhaps safe in the knowledge that there would be no further duelling from his team mate.

Pedrosa finished fifth for Honda ahead of Danilo Petrucci on a non-works Ducati. Italian great Valentino Rossi finished seventh on his Yamaha.

In the Moto2 category, Kalex rider Franco Morbidelli sewed up the championship before the race was even run after the Italian’s nearest challenger Thomas Luthi was forced to pull out after breaking a foot during qualifying.

Morbidelli finished third in the race, with KTM’s Miguel Oliveira taking the win.

Chief executive officer Timotheus Hoettges also urged the new German government to think twice before selling down its large stake in Deutsche Telekom, according to an interview in Welt am Sonntag.

T-Mobile US, majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, is close to agreeing tentative terms on a deal to merge with Sprint Corp, people familiar with the matter have said, a breakthrough in efforts to merge the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers.

Hoettges, in the interview published on Sunday, declined to comment directly on talks between the companies.

“In the U.S. there is a duopoly between two very big players, and then there are two smaller players well behind,” he said. “A third strong player would be good for competition.”

Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N) are the two largest wireless carriers.

Competition regulators have in the past quashed consolidation efforts by T-Mobile, but Hoettges said chances are now better under U.S. President Donald Trump.

“History has taught us that governments led by Republicans are more hands-off than Democratic administrations,” he said.

On the German state’s nearly 32 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom, Hoettges acknowledged it would be the new government’s decision whether to sell or keep.

But he said those who argued for a sale “should perhaps ask themselves who will buy the stake”.

“What interest would the owner have in infrastructure security? Would the owner want to invest in Germany, and if so, where and in particular, how much?”

“At least we have something left,” he said, standing in a room with clothes, toys, ornaments and damaged pictures strewn across the floor.

“Others have nothing. They lost their homes, they lost their lives.”

Ismail, 44, the Imam of a nearby mosque, considers himself one of the luckiest people in Marawi. The city was devastated by more than 150 days of battles between government forces and pro-Islamic State militants that killed more than 1,100 people and displaced some 350,000.

His house is in Marawi’s safe zone, an area long abandoned by residents but untouched by unrelenting shelling and military air strikes that have all but flattened the city’s commercial heart, destroying thousands of homes, shops and vehicles.

Six days after troops killed the last remaining rebels, Ismail was among about 4,000 people allowed to return to their homes on Sunday in Marawi’s Basak Malutlot area.

Many like him have discovered their houses were looted and left in disarray.

“I opened the door and I was shocked, but I‘m still happy to be home,” he said.

Ismail fled with his family on May 24 during a fierce three-day firefight that erupted just 50 meters away, when security forces tried to raid the hideout of notorious militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State’s anointed “emir” in Southeast Asia.

Hapilon escaped, then issued a call to arms to hundreds of insurgents to initiate their planned takeover of Marawi. It sparked the Philippines’ biggest urban battle in recent history, and fears that Islamic State’s extremist agenda had gained a foothold in the south of the mainly Catholic country.

There were scenes of joy and chaos as a convoy of returning residents poured in to Marawi to a cacophony of horns and whistles, jamming what only a few hours earlier were deserted streets.

Armed police at checkpoints cross-checked documents and pictures of each passengers from the 712 families, to guard against possible infiltration by militants.

Bush apologized through a spokesman on Wednesday for what an actress described as a sexual assault but which Bush said was intended as a friendly pat and a joke to put her at ease during a picture-taking session.

Heather Lind, who starred in the AMC cable television network’s historical drama “Turn: Washington’s Spies,” accused Bush of groping her as they posed for photos together with his wife and others during a promotional event for the show in 2014.

The allegation surfaced in an Instagram post from Lind featuring a photograph of Bush, 93, shaking hands with former President Barack Obama during an appearance of all five living former presidents at Saturday’s hurricane fund-raising benefit.

In the post, Lind, 34, said that seeing that photo reminded her of her own meeting with the 41st president three years earlier, when, according to her, “he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.”

“He didn’t shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side,” Lind wrote. “He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again.”

Lind said the former first lady “rolled her eyes as if to say, ‘not again.'”

The Instagram post, since deleted, carried the “MeToo” social media hashtag spawned by the recent outpouring of sexual assault and sexual harassment accusations leveled against former Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied engaging in non-consensual sex with anyone.

Bush’s spokesman Jim McGrath, issued a statement in response to Lind’s post that sought to explain the former president’s behavior as an attempt to make light of social awkwardness posed by his own physical disability during photo sessions.

Confined to a wheelchair, as Bush has been for about the past five years, “his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he take pictures,” McGrath said.

“To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke - and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate,” McGrath wrote. “To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.”

Clashes in Kawangware and in a village in western Kenya following Thursday’s vote were the first signs that face-offs between Odinga supporters and the police might eventually morph into neighbors turning against each other.

“A country cannot be ruled by the gun. Standing here in this church we want to condemn the militarization of politics in this country,” Odinga told residents in the Nairobi slum.

The veteran opposition leader had boycotted the re-run of an August presidential election that was nullified by Kenya’s Supreme Court on procedural grounds, leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta with an almost free run against six minor candidates.

On Friday, a day after the repeat vote was held in most of the country, ethnic violence in Kawangware saw dozens of homes and shops torched and one man killed. Most of buildings torched belonged to residents from the Kenyatta’s Kikuyu tribe.

One man from Odinga’s Luo group was killed overnight near Koguta village in the west of the country, after residents from two ethnic groups backing different candidates armed themselves.

If such isolated incidents become a trend, it could ignite large swathes of Kenya, as happened after a 2007 presidential election when weeks of violence left 1,200 dead. That sent ripples throughout East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and diplomatic hub.

In his speech, Odinga condemned violence generally and did not single out any particular attack.

“We have come here to give consolation to those who were beaten and killed. We as NASA condemn what happened,” he told worshippers at a church in Kawangware, referring to his National Super Alliance, an opposition coalition.

Odinga boycotted Thursday’s vote because he said the contest would not be fair. Instead, he wanted the Oct. 26 contest dismissed and fresh elections held within 90 days.

His withdrawal means Kenyans are watching the turnout, rather than the result, for an indication of Kenyatta’s popularity for a second, five-year term.

Results published on Sunday by the election commission showed that Kenyatta had won slightly more than 98 percent of the vote with results in from 244 out of 291 constituencies.

Turnout for the constituencies counted so far was 43 percent. That figure is likely to decrease when it includes returns of 0 from least 23 constituencies where authorities were unable to open even a single polling station because of protests by Odinga’s supporters.

King Bhumibol, the world’s longest reigning monarch when he died last year at the age of 88, ruled Thailand from shortly after World War Two and was revered as a stabilizing figure through coups, protests and natural disasters.

Over 19 million Thais - more than a quarter of the 69 million population - participated in ceremonies by presenting symbolic sandalwood flowers to be burned at temples and crematorium replicas across the country, according to the government.

On Sunday, the late king’s bones were moved to the Chakri Throne Hall, where royal relics are kept within the Grand Palace in a ceremony that involved senior monks from temples across the country. His son, new King Maha Vajiralongkorn, led the religious rite.

On Sunday evening, Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana led the final royal procession on horseback to the Wat Rajabopidh and Wat Bovoranives temples where her grandfather’s ashes were placed in keeping with a ceremony steeped in religious symbolism and tradition. Mourners, some in tears, were gathered outside the temples.

The Luo community largely boycotted Thursday’s election, which was supposed to again pit opposition leader Raila Odinga, a Luo, against President Uhuru Kenyatta, a Kikuyu with a Kalenjin deputy president.

The Supreme Court ordered a repeat after it nullified Kenyatta’s win in an August election on procedural grounds.

The motive and perpetrators for the killing in western Kenya were unclear, but it came a day after villagers from the Luo and Kalenjin communities armed themselves against each other.

The body of 64-year-old George Odumbe, a Luo laborer at the local sugar company, was found with three arrows in the back and severe head wounds, a Reuters witness in the village of Koguta said. It was found in a field between Koguta and the nearby Kalengin village of Mau.

Locals warned the death of the Luo man could spark tit-for-tat violence.

“There’s a desire for revenge by the Luo community, I‘m trying to tell them to stay calm, but they are so bitter and angry,” Gordon Onyango, 32, a Luo, said. “The two sides are both having meetings now and they are both armed.”

Reuters was unable to speak with the Kalenjin community in Mau, but saw a group of young men from the village gathered under a tree. Most were armed with bows and arrows.

Odinga withdrew from the rerun election, saying it would not be fair. In his strongholds in the west, an area that has long felt excluded from political and economic power, protesters prevented polling stations from opening in four counties.

Across Kenya, about 10 percent of polling stations were unable to open, although there were no problems in Kenyatta’s areas. Turnout plummeted to about 35 percent from 80 percent in August, undercutting Kenyata’s hopes for a decisive mandate for a second term.

In some parts of the country, such as Koguta in Kisumu county, protests damaged relations with other communities who wanted to vote for Kenyatta.

That anger risks igniting ethnic violence, which killed around 1,200 people after a disputed 2007 presidential vote, but which has been largely absent from this election.

At least 51 people have been killed in political violence since August, but most deaths have occurred in clashes between protesters and police.

Police, although stationed only 400 meters from where the body was discovered, declined to visit the scene for several hours until reinforcements arrived.

Around five hours after the body was found, police took it to the nearby town of Muhoroni.

Police did not answer calls from Reuters. But Julius Genga, a county legislator, said by phone while he was driving to the scene: “We want the police to be deployed to try to restore calm because after the death of this man, tension is boiling up and we don’t want it to escalate it to unmanageable levels.”

Kericho county governor Paul Chepkwony told Reuters that he hoped the death would be “an isolated one”.

On Saturday when he and the Kisumu county governor visited the area, he said, “We delivered the message, aside from parties or politics, that everyone wants peace. That’s still our message.”",Man killed with arrows in Kenyan village on edge over elections,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-election-killings/man-killed-with-arrows-in-kenyan-village-on-edge-over-elections-idUSKBN1CY0A6?il=0

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran.","These are challenging times for North Africa’s Muslim governments. Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite. Algiers was Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s first stop in North Africa in June.

Given the tiny number of Shi’ites living in North Africa and the tight control over mosques in the region, widespread Shi’ite religious influence on the ground is unrealistic. Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

The “Greater Jerusalem” legislation would put some settlements in the occupied West Bank, built on land Palestinians seek for a future state and viewed as illegal by most countries, under the jurisdiction of Jerusalem’s municipality.

The bill, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, was to have been submitted for approval on Sunday to a ministerial committee on legislation, a first step before a series of ratification votes in parliament.

But Likud lawmaker David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu’s coalition in parliament, said a vote by the cabinet committee would be delayed because Washington told Israel the bill’s passage could impede U.S. efforts to revive peace talks that collapsed in 2014.

“There is American pressure that claims this is about annexation and that this could interfere with the peace process,” Bitan told Army Radio.

“The prime minister doesn’t think this is about annexation. I don’t think so either. We have to take the time to clarify matters to the Americans. Therefore, if the bill passes in a week, or in a month, it’s less problematic,” he said.

Proponents of the legislation say it falls short of formal land annexation to Israel but will enable some 150,000 settlers to vote in Jerusalem city elections. Intelligence Minister Israel Katz, a supporter of the bill, has said this would “ensure a Jewish majority in a united Jerusalem”.

Israel’s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector it captured along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a 1967 Middle East war, has not won international recognition. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Israeli media reports said the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, had conveyed misgivings about the legislation, under which the large Maale Adumim and Beitar Illit settlements would become part of a Greater Jerusalem municipality.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as telling cabinet ministers on Sunday: “The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was all about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth continuing to talk and coordinate with them.”

A U.S. embassy spokeswoman declined immediate comment.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

The cross-party commission, comprising 40 parliamentarians, was set up to look into the scandals and crises that have rocked Italian banks in recent years.

“Only the commission as a whole will be able to make a final judgment, but indications of improper behavior have certainly been found,” Casini said in the interview published on Sunday.

Casini said the initial findings pointed to a “network of complicity” that resulted in offers of employment and consultancy jobs.

“It’s certainly not a good thing seeing Bank of Italy directors quickly take up top positions at the banks that were the target of inquiries,” Casini said. “If this had happened to a politician, it would certainly have triggered a chorus of deserved criticism.”

The cross-party commission has the same investigative powers as the magistrature, although it has little to reach conclusions before the legislature ends. The role of the Bank of Italy and market watchdog Consob, which share supervision of the sector, is expected to come under scrutiny.

The government has had to spend more than 20 billion euros ($23.22 billion) this year to prop up the sector, injecting 5.4 billion euros to salvage Italy’s fourth-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), and offering billions of euros in guarantees as it wound down two major banks in the Veneto region.

Four other, smaller banks were wound down in 2015, hitting thousands of small savers.

Critics have accused both the Bank of Italy and Consob of failing in their oversight duties - allegations both bodies have rejected.

Casini said, however, that the initial findings also showed how many of the judiciary investigations had been triggered by inspections launched by the Bank of Italy itself.

“It’s a mix bag of positives and negatives. We need to understand which had dominated,” he said.

Asked about a risk that the inquiry could serve only as electoral propaganda before a forthcoming election, Casini said he had voiced the same concerns when the commission was set up but now would seek to guarantee that it does not become “political battleground”.

China regards self-ruled Taiwan as sovereign territory and regularly calls it the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States, complaining to Washington about transit stops by Taiwanese presidents.

China has not renounced the possible use of force to bring the island under its control.

Tsai, who China believes is seeking formal independence for Taiwan, left on Saturday on a week-long trip to three Pacific island allies - Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands - via Honolulu and the U.S. territory of Guam.

For her part, Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan’s democracy and security.

Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department said Tsai’s transits through U.S. soil would be “private and unofficial” and were based on long-standing U.S. practice consistent with “our unofficial relations with Taiwan”.

It noted there was “no change to the U.S. one-China policy” which recognizes that Beijing takes the view that there is only one China, and Taiwan is part of it.

Tsai, accompanied by her entourage and members of the media, left on a short boat ride for the USS Arizona Memorial, which is built over the remains of the battleship sunk in Pearl Harbor in the Second World War, on Saturday afternoon.

The memorial, where Tsai was expected to lay a wreath, now forms a centerpiece of the World War Two Valor in the Pacific National Monument, a site administered by the National Park Service.

U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit China in less than two weeks. He angered Beijing last December by taking a telephone call from Tsai shortly after he won the presidential election.

The trip to the United States is Tsai’s second this year. In January she stopped over in Houston and San Francisco on her way to and from Latin America, visiting the headquarters of Twitter, which is blocked in China.

With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement’s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament.

Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one.

The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom.

Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust.

The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s use of offshore tax havens.

In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world’s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability.

After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties.

The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament’s 63 seats.

“The opposition has a majority, so that’s a message. But we’ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,” Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday.

The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.

The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament.

The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year’s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland’s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters.

Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said: ”I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it’s normal that we should be a part of a future government.

“We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,” he said. “We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.”

His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.

The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year’s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.

“I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,” said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government.

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

SLIGHT UNIONIST LEAD

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Slideshow (4 Images)

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CY072-OCATP

Instead, the struggle will, as it did during the fight against the Sunni extremists of Islamic State, involve shifting Sunni and Shi’ite allegiances.

For the moment, there seems to be an easing in the historic tensions between the two main – and often warring – branches of Islam. Religious differences are not the focus; this is a classic geopolitical power struggle for control of Iraq, Syria, and Kurdistan, and for expanding diplomatic and strategic reach throughout the region.

Iran is lined up to be the big winner in Syria. Islamic State's defeat will significantly lessen Sunni influence, and Tehran’s role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's protector will only increase now that it appears Assad will remain in control of some portion of the country. Iran will have pieced together a land corridor to the Mediterranean. The Saudis will be left with little influence.

The same goes for the United States. American forces have been largely relegated to playing traffic cop among various on-again off-again allies such as the Turks and Kurds, each with its own agenda in Syria. Any influence Washington thinks it still has is further diluted by the presence of the Russians, who are there to support Assad while maintaining a permanent presence in the heart of the Middle East. American efforts may wind up as little more than fumbling around to keep Israel and Jordan from overreacting to the increased Iranian influence on their borders.

In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Riyadh appears to be pivoting towards warmer relations with the Shi’ite government in Baghdad. That a Saudi airline is announcing the first return of direct service between the two countries since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 is no coincidence, nor is it an isolated event.

The Saudis also appear ready to take advantage of a looming intra-Shi’ite power struggle in Baghdad among Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, the most religiously zealous of the group, has always been something of a nationalist and is wary of Iranian influence. It is thus not surprising he made friendly trips under official invitation to Sunni Riyadh, and the United Arab Emirates, in recent months.

Sadr is an interesting choice for the Saudis to use to gain influence in Baghdad. Real progress for Riyadh means untangling years of close Iranian cooperation in Iraq, to include limiting the power of the Iranian-backed militias. Sadr has significant influence in that respect, and can use his popularity and credibility to sell Saudi cooperation to his followers who remember Saudi funding of al Qaeda in Iraq and Islamic State over the years. Enhancing Sadr's Shi’ite religious status can further Sunni Saudi goals. During his visit, the Saudis gifted Sadr with $10 million for “rebuilding,” and also astutely threw in some visas for this year’s Hajj pilgrimage for Sadr to distribute.

The Saudis otherwise have little to work with in Iraq compared to Iran. Tehran’s ties to officials in Baghdad are just a tiny part of a deep relationship forged in the bloody fight against the American occupiers and the ousting of Islamic State. Iranian money continues to support Iraq, and the Shi’ite militias are still mostly under Iranian influence.

Iran is also probably the most stable Muslim nation in the Middle East. It has existed more or less within its current borders for thousands of years, and is largely religiously, culturally, and linguistically homogeneous (though keep an eye on the Kurdish minority.) While governed in significant part by its clerics, the country has held a series of increasingly democratic elections. And unlike the Saudi monarchs, Iran’s leaders do not rule in fear of an Islamic revolution. They already had one.

Power struggles create flashpoints, and the Saudi-Iranian fight post-Islamic State is no exception. The Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen has settled into a version of World War One-style trench warfare, with neither side strong enough to win nor weak enough to lose. In an ugly form of stasis, the conflict seems likely to stay within its present borders.

The powder keg is Kurdistan. Though arguably a de facto state since 2003, after the Kurds voted formally voted for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum, Iran and the Iranian-backed government in Baghdad were pressed to make clear they will not tolerate an actual Kurdish nation. With Islamic State nearly defeated and combat-tested Shi’ite militias ready for their next tasks, Tehran and Baghdad no longer need to keep the Kurds on their side. Fighting has already broken out around Kirkuk, an oil-rich city in Iraqi Kurdistan, between forces supported by Baghdad/Tehran and Kurdish fighters – leaving a gap for the Saudis to offer financial or covert support to the Iraqi Kurds.

Saudi involvement could morph an Iraqi civil war into a new proxy struggle right on Iran’s own western border, with the possible complication of further unrest inside Iran by its Kurdish minority.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

While it may seem odd to write about the changing balance of power in the Middle East largely leaving out the United States, that may well describe America’s range of options post-Islamic State.

Washington’s influence in Baghdad is limited and relations with Iran are in shambles under the Trump administration. It is highly unlikely America will join Iran to fight against Kurdish allies who helped defeat Islamic State. Nor are American troops likely to battle Iranian-led militias in support of Kurdish independence that Washington says it doesn’t really support right now.

That leaves the United States sidelined, with few options other than perhaps supporting the Saudis from afar in whatever anti-Iranian meddling they do in Iraq.

Some lawmakers from states where state and local taxes are high and people benefit most from the federal income tax deduction are reluctant to contemplate such an elimination. It would be one of several measures aimed at offsetting lost revenue under sweeping tax cuts planned by President Donald Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress.

“We’re working with these lawmakers. We are making progress, but we aren’t there yet,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News Channel. “I‘m hopeful at the end of the day we can find a good solution for them.”

A budget blueprint central to Republican efforts to enact the tax cut package - because it will enable easier passage of the package through the Senate - barely squeaked through the House on Thursday, with Democrats solidly opposed and a number of Republicans voting no in an effort to protect the deduction.

Republican leaders had sketched out a tax cut plan that would eliminate the tax break, although detailed legislation will not be unveiled until next Wednesday.

Brady also said lawmakers were exchanging ideas with Trump over how to handle 401(k) retirement savings plans.

In another measure to offset lost revenue, House Republicans have considered eliminating or capping the ability to contribute to the plans on a pre-tax basis, but Trump has said he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program.

“We want to increase the amount that you can give to your 401(k) or IRA (individual retirement account), for 401(k)s up to $20,000 or more,” Brady told Fox, without specifying whether that would be on a pre-tax or after-tax basis.

“We’re actually exchanging ideas with the president on how we help people save more and save sooner in their lives.”

White Tale, the investment vehicle of hedge fund manager Keith Meister and New York-based fund 40 North, had raised its Clariant stake to above 20 percent, Reuters reported on Thursday ahead of the announcement the tie-up was dead.

White Tale’s rising stake, coupled with other Clariant shareholders who came out against the deal, left the Swiss company doubtful of mustering the two-thirds support necessary for the merger to go through.

The successful revolt comes amid a wave of investor activism in Switzerland, where Credit Suisse and Nestle both face demands for change.

Chief Executive Hariolf Kottmann said Clariant still had options to explore after further talks with White Tale, which had so far not presented the company with an alternative plan.

“To do a merger of equals ... is one option, to make a large transformational transaction is another option, to continue to stand alone is a third option,” Kottmann told reporters on a call where he vowed to remain CEO.

Some analysts said Clariant could become a bid target, though its shares fell about 5 percent on Friday.

“Clariant is again the No. 1 takeover target,” said Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer, who said bidders might wait until Clariant’s share price fell further, or to see if White Tale could install management more favorable to a takeover.

The collapse of the merger also poses a challenge for Huntsman’s founding family, which was set to hold a significant stake in the combined entity but could now struggle to play a role in a consolidating industry without losing influence.

‘SOMETHING MORE SHORT TERM’

Clariant and Huntsman in May struck an agreement that would have given Clariant 52 percent of the combined entity, saying the deal would produce around $400 million in annual cost synergies and create the world’s second-biggest specialty chemicals maker behind Evonik.

In fighting the Huntsman tie-up, Meister and 40 North’s David Winter and David Millstone contended the merger would not deliver enough benefits, while exposing Clariant to Huntsman’s debt and volatile commodity chemicals business.

Speculation the deal might fail had been mounting as even supporters sold down their stakes.

“I thought it was a fantastic deal,” said one investor, who sold out on fears White Tale was gaining the upper hand. “I think White Tale want something more short term.”

Alex Roepers, CEO of the $1.3 billion Atlantic Investment Management group, said he had sold the rest of his Clariant stake on Friday, locking in a 50 percent gain in under a year.

“As a stand-alone company, without the potential merger synergies and portfolio optimization, we regard Clariant as fairly valued at the current share price level,” he said, adding he would monitor Clariant for another attractive entry point.

Clariant shares had risen about 38 percent this year before Friday’s announcement but were still more cheaply rated than rivals, trading at a multiple of 18.7 times forecast earnings against an average 21.3 ratio of peers in the chemicals industry, according to Starmine data.

TAKEOVER TARGET

A source familiar with the acquisition strategy of Germany’s Evonik said it would potentially be interested in acquiring portions of Clariant should the Swiss company be broken up. Evonik declined to comment.

Two years ago, Evonik held talks with buyout group CVC over a potential joint offer for Clariant, although Kottmann has said he never received a formal bid.

“There were never serious discussions with another peer, where we were asked if we would divest ourselves, shop the company and be taken over,” Kottmann said.

Huntsman CEO Peter Huntsman said separately he was disappointed the merger with Clariant did not go through.

Clariant and Huntsman, which said its third-quarter costs linked to the merger were $18 million, agreed to forgo breakup fees. Clariant had faced a potential $210 million hit from walking away from the deal, and a $60 million fee if Clariant shareholders failed to approved the transaction.

Clariant, which had hired Goldman Sachs to try to rescue the merger, makes aircraft de-icer, retardant for wildfires, plastics colorings, chemicals to help oil drillers separate oil from water and ingredients for shampoos.

Kottmann said Clariant would sit down again with Meister, Millstone and Winter.

A White Tale spokesman said only it would seek talks with management before commenting. Previously it said it would accept a seat on Clariant’s board as biggest shareholder.

Konstantin Winterstein, a Clariant board member and one of the representatives of Bavarian families that own 14 percent of Clariant, had supported the merger and is sticking by Kottmann.

“Clariant’s development under the long engagement of Hariolf Kottmann and his team has been outstanding and remains well positioned to continue its successful course even without the merger,” Winterstein said.",Activist investors scupper $20 billion Clariant-Huntsman merger,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clariant-huntsman-statement/activist-investors-scupper-20-billion-clariant-huntsman-merger-idUSKBN1CW0FX

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Friday ordered a 24-hour suspension of military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq. The two sides held a first round of talks on Friday and Saturday .

Abadi said the talks are meant to prepare for the peaceful deployment of Iraqi troops at the border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria in Iraq’s Kurdistan region.

Clashes broke out between the two sides after Iraqi forces captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk from the Peshmerga, in a surprise offensive ordered by Abadi after the Kurds held an independence referendum in northern Iraq on Sept. 25.

Kirkuk is part of so-called disputed areas, claimed by both the Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq.

“The second round of talks about deploying federal troops in the disputed areas has started,” State TV said, giving no further details.

Abadi wants to take control of the disputed areas and the border crossings, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.

The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution” - a call rejected by Baghdad.

U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country.

The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG’s official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16. But the Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region.

The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by KRG President Masoud Barzani, since it halved the region’s oil export revenue.

The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur and south of their capital, Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides.

Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he was “disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution” and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG “overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution”.

Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,” he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.","Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga start new round of talks, Iraqi State TV says",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-talks/iraqi-forces-kurdish-peshmerga-start-new-round-of-talks-iraqi-state-tv-says-idUSKBN1CY0GF

Lo hanno riferito a Reuters due fonti a conoscenza del dossier.

“Il ministero dello Sviluppo Economico ha chiesto a Cdp di valutare l‘ingresso in Am InvestCo perché teme che la Commissione Europea possa rilevare problemi di concorrenza. Cdp sta valutando”, ha detto la prima fonte.

Am InvestCo è il consorzio che fa capo per 85% ad ArcelorMittal che a giugno si è aggiudicato la gara per Ilva. Nel consorzio è presente con il 15% il gruppo Marcegaglia. ArcelorMittal è il più grande gruppo siderurgico mondiale, mentre Marcegaglia si definisce “gruppo industriale leader mondiale nella trasformazione dell‘acciaio”.

“Non si tratta di una richiesta formale, ma il ministero teme problemi con l‘Antitrust. Arcelor ci sta lavorando e Cdp potrebbe rilevare parte o tutta la quota del Gruppo Marcegaglia”, ha detto la seconda fonte.

Una fonte di settore spiega che il problema riguarda “i prodotti rivestiti, in particolare le zincature, perché sommando capacità produttiva di Arcelor, Marcegaglia e Ilva si supererebbero i limiti”.

Una fonte industriale dice di non sapere se Cdp sarà coinvolta o meno, ma conferma che c‘è un rischio di concentrazione in alcuni “segmenti” per Arcelor e Marcegaglia, e che in questo caso la soluzione passerebbe per l‘uscita parziale o totale del gruppo italiano.

La decisione dell‘Antitrust europeo sull‘acquisizione di Ilva da parte di Am InvestCo, in un primo tempo fissata entro il 26 ottobre, è stata rinviata al 13 novembre.

Nel frattempo, il 19 ottobre scorso, Arcelor ha offerto alcune concessioni alla Commissione Europea sul dossier per favorire il via libera, anche se Bruxelles non ha fornito dettagli a riguardo.

Il semaforo verde della Commissione Europea è uno dei passi essenziali per arrivare al closing dell‘operazione Ilva, insieme all‘accordo con i sindacati sul piano industriale.

Cdp faceva parte della cordata sconfitta nella gara per Ilva, insieme ad Arvedi, Delfin e l‘indiana Jindal.

Nei mesi scorsi Arcelor ha annunciato che al termine dell‘acquisizione Intesa Sanpaolo sarebbe entrata nella compagine del consorzio. La banca acquisirebbe, secondo un‘altra fonte industriale, il 9% mentre Marcegaglia che scenderebbe al 6% dall‘attuale 15%.

L‘ingresso di Cdp nel capitale della “nuova” Ilva era stato chiesto nelle scorse settimane anche da alcuni sindacalisti, che contestano il taglio di circa 4.000 dipendenti di Ilva chiesto da Am InvestCo oltre alla riduzione salariale.

Il ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, Cdp, Arcelor Mittal e una portavoce della direzione concorrenza della Commissione Europea non commentano la notizia. Non è stato possibile raggiungere il Gruppo Marcegaglia.

The moves will be made during the country’s annual meeting of parliament early next year, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party’s anti-graft watchdog, said in its report to a five-yearly party congress last week.

Roma, who host Chelsea in a Champions League Group C match on Tuesday, clocked up their third successive 1-0 win when they beat midtable Bologna on Saturday after previously overcoming Torino and lowly Crotone by the same score.

Roma’s visit to Chelsea two weeks ago ended in a 3-3 draw but that performance seems very much the exception for a side who have scored 17 goals and conceded five in 10 league games this season and boast the best defensive record in Serie A.

Di Francesco, however, has never been associated with negative tactics and blamed the low scoring on Roma’s flaws in the final third of the field.

“I wouldn’t say we won ugly, nor would I describe our win against Crotone as such,” he said after Saturday’s game. “When you create lots of openings it casts a 1-0 win in a different light.”

”We made too many mistakes in the opposition half during the opening period today and we didn’t always keep our heads in front of goal. We fashioned lots of good chances -– we just needed to be a bit more clinical in finishing off moves.”

Di Francesco built his coaching reputation during a five-year spell at Sassuolo during which he led them out of Serie B, making their home town of the same name the smallest ever to be represented in the top flight.

There was a six-week interruption in January 2014 when he was sacked but he was quickly reappointed the following month.

In June, he became the eighth coach to occupy the hot seat at Roma in the last nine seasons when he replaced Luciano Spalletti, who left despite leading them to second place in Serie A with a club-record points total.

A former Roma player, Di Francesco quickly brought in his favoured 4-3-3 formation which features one holding player in midfield and two wide players in attack.

Despite a 3-1 home defeat to Spalletti’s new side Inter Milan, Roma have adapted well to Di Francesco’s system, winning eight of their opening 10 Serie A games.

Di Francesco praised his players for “putting in the work both when defending and when attacking, and trying to play the way I want them to play -– which is by having the ball.”

”They’re taking on board certain ideas we’ve been working on since the start of the season, when we had a few teething difficulties,” he said. “Our movement is looking much better oiled now.”

He was especially pleased with the way his midfield and attack had adapted to his pressing-based system.

“The best work for our defensive line is what our midfielders and forwards are doing,” he said. “Even Edin Dzeko up front is chasing down opponents on every ball.”","Soccer: Roma not as dull as results suggest, coach says",https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-champions-rom/soccer-roma-not-as-dull-as-results-suggest-coach-says-idINKBN1CY0FA?il=0

The indictment was sealed under orders from a federal judge so it was not clear what the charges were or who the target was, the source said, adding that it could be unsealed as early as Monday.

The filing of charges by the grand jury in Washington was first reported on Friday by CNN, which said the target could be taken into custody as soon as Monday.

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the election to try to help President Donald Trump defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her campaign.

Special counsel Robert Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is investigating whether Trump campaign officials colluded with those Russian efforts.

“If the Special Counsel finds it necessary and appropriate, the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a May 17 letter appointing Mueller.

Sources familiar with Mueller’s investigation said he has used that broad authority to investigate links between Trump aides and foreign governments as well as possible money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on Friday.

Trump, a Republican who was elected president last November, has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as “a witch hunt”.

The Kremlin has denied the allegations.

Mueller’s investigation also includes an effort to determine whether Trump or any of his aides tried to obstruct justice.

The special counsel’s team has conducted interviews with former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, former spokesman Sean Spicer and other current and former White House officials.

In July, FBI agents raided the home in Virginia of Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose financial and real estate dealings and prior work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine are being investigated by Mueller’s team.

Mueller was appointed to lead the investigation a week after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was heading a federal probe into possible collusion with Russia.

Trump initially said he fired Comey because his leadership of the FBI was inadequate and hurt morale, but in a later interview with NBC he cited “this Russia thing” as his reason.

SHADOW

The Russia investigation has cast a shadow over Trump’s nine-month-old presidency and widened the partisan rift between Republicans and Democrats.

Republican lawmakers earlier this week launched investigations to examine several of Trump’s longstanding political grievances, including the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton’s emails and her alleged role in a sale of U.S. uranium to a Russian firm.

Mueller’s team has also investigated Michael Flynn, who was an adviser to Trump’s campaign and later briefly served as his national security adviser.

Flynn was fired from that post in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year.

While he was on Trump’s campaign team, Flynn also had a $600,000 contract from a Turkish businessman to help discredit U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Turkey’s government of instigating a failed coup in July 2016.

Former CIA director James Woolsey, who was also an adviser to the Trump campaign, has alleged that Flynn discussed with the businessman and two Turkish government ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States to face charges in Turkey.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey, said on Friday that Woolsey and his wife have been in communication with the FBI and Mueller’s team about the claim.

Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, “have responded to every request, whether from the FBI, or, more recently, the Office of the Special Counsel,” Franks said in a statement.

Flynn has previously denied through a spokesperson that such a plan was ever discussed.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Woolsey and his wife last year pitched a $10 million project to the same Turkish businessman who had agreed a smaller contract with Flynn. They did not win a contract.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal but Flynn came under scrutiny because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did on the Gulen project.",First charges filed in U.S. special counsel's Russia investigation: source,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-charges/first-charges-filed-in-u-s-special-counsels-russia-investigation-source-idUSKBN1CX00V?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president for ads, said in a blog post that the company would launch a publicly searchable archive next year containing details about the advertisements it runs related to U.S. federal elections.

Details will include the size of spending and the demographics of the audience the ads reached, Goldman said. The archive, beginning with ads carried in 2018, will cover a rolling four-year period, he said.

Internet political ads have boomed in recent years as U.S. politicians looked for different ways to reach potential supporters, and as companies including Facebook have created tools to allow targeted marketing.

Online ads, though, are generally viewable only to the intended audience, raising concerns among transparency advocates, researchers and lawmakers about how to hold politicians accountable for what they say.

The planned archive reflects a change in corporate policy for the world’s largest social network, which had previously resisted the idea.

In June, Facebook told Reuters that it would go on treating political ads like all others and that creating an online repository would violate the confidentiality of those advertisers.

Since then, Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google have all said that Russia-based operatives bought ads and used fake names on their services to spread politically divisive messages in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. election.

Moscow has denied interfering in the election.

Next week, general counsels for Facebook, Google and Twitter will testify before public hearings of three U.S. congressional committees about the alleged interference and proposed legislation to require them to disclose election-related ads.

Goldman wrote in his post: “Transparency helps everyone, especially political watchdog groups and reporters, keep advertisers accountable for who they say they are and what they say to different groups.”

Facebook said its archive will eventually expand beyond the United States and show ads from elections in other countries and jurisdictions.

In the future, advertisers on Facebook will also be required to include a disclosure in election-related ads, to read: “Paid for by,” the company said.

The announcement fleshes out ideas that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg outlined in September, as criticism of California-based Facebook built inside the United States over the Russian ads.

The changes will test in Canada before being brought to the United States ahead of November 2018 elections, Facebook said.

Twitter took similar steps this week, saying it would add labels to election-related ads and say who is behind them, and it barred two Russian media outlets from running ads.","Facebook, in reversal, to publish cache of political ads",https://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-advertising/facebook-in-reversal-to-publish-cache-of-political-ads-idINKBN1CW2LC

With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement’s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament.

Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one.

The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom.

Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust.

The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s use of offshore tax havens.

In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world’s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability.

After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties.

The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament’s 63 seats.

“The opposition has a majority, so that’s a message. But we’ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,” Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday.

The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.

The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament.

The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year’s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland’s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters.

Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said: ”I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it’s normal that we should be a part of a future government.

“We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,” he said. “We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.”

His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.

The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year’s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.

“I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,” said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government.

The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history.

The Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for this weekend’s attack. The government responded by sacking two of the country’s top security officials.

“So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,” Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters.

At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. And a woman, Madobe Nunow, was beheaded while her “three children were shot dead,” he said.

A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel.

Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said.

The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel’s defenses. Then gunmen stormed the building.

The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.

The government sacked the country’s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, a statement from the prime minister’s office said.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.

”After the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces.

Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. The government and al Shabaab typically give different figures for victims in such attacks.

The twin bombings in Mogadishu on Oct. 14 killed at least 358 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history, igniting nationwide outrage. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but the method - a large truck bomb - is one it has often used.

(Reuters) - The Weinstein Co film company on Thursday was sued by its founder and former co-chairman Harvey Weinstein who is seeking information that could help defend himself against sexual assault allegations, and also help defend the company against potential liability.

In the lawsuit filed in Delaware’s Court of Chancery, Weinstein said he needed the information to prevent the company, in which he and his brother remain the largest investors, from being harmed by unjustified legal settlements.

Representatives for Weinstein and The Weinstein Co did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Weinstein Co has been one of Hollywood’s most influential forces since its launch in October 2005 and has produced and distributed films including “The King’s Speech” and “Silver Linings Playbook.”

The New York Times reported earlier this month that Weinstein, 65, had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.

The New Yorker magazine reported that 13 women had claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.

On Tuesday, an actress who accuses Weinstein of sexually assaulting her filed a negligence lawsuit against the company, saying it was aware Weinstein had previously settled other allegations of harassment and assault and should not have let her meet privately with the movie producer in a hotel room.

The New York City Police Department has said it is investigating an allegation of sexual assault by Weinstein in 2004.

The Los Angeles Police Department also said earlier this month that it is investigating a 2013 sexual assault allegation against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

In Thursday’s lawsuit, Weinstein said he also wants to investigate whether confidential information was leaked to the press, if the Weinstein Company’s board and executives wrongly terminated him as chief executive, and if the board is pursuing a “fire sale” of the company, according to the complaint and attached exhibits.

“Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account -- which is the only one he used throughout the time he was employed by the company -- will contain information exonerating him, and therefore the company, from claims that may be asserted against them,” Weinstein’s lawyer wrote in an email to the Weinstein company, according to Thursday’s filing.

With margins squeezed by a stagnant domestic market and rivalry from China and South Korea, many factories have cut costs, reducing their reliance on workers in lifetime employment in favor of laborers on temporary contracts.

As they have done so, safety scandals have erupted across the country’s much-vaunted manufacturing sector, with Subaru Corp on Friday joining Nissan Motor Co Ltd in admitting it failed to follow proper vehicle inspection procedures.

Earlier this month, Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, Kobe Steel Ltd, said its workers had tampered with product specifications for years, leaving companies around the world scrambling to verify the safety of cars, planes, trains and electrical goods.

Unable to easily lay off “regular” employees, full-time employees with permanent contracts and pay scales based on seniority that formed the heart of Japan’s post-war workforce, companies have increasingly come to rely on “non-regular” workers - temps, part-timers and short-term contract workers.

These non-regular workers allow companies to cut costs and adjust their workforce, said Koji Morioka, emeritus professor at Kansai University and an expert on workplace issues. But it has led to a de-skilling of the factory floor, lowering standards and increasing the likelihood of wrongdoing and accidents, he said.

“The use of these ‘disposable’ workers is greatly increasing,” Morioka said. “The loss of experienced, skilled workers on the factory floor is becoming more and more risky.”

The share of non-regular workers in the labor force has risen from 20 percent in the early 1990s to a record 37.5 percent last year - with the proportion in some companies higher still.

The pay gap is stark, with regular workers last year on average paid 321,700 yen ($2,830) monthly compared with 211,800 yen for contract workers.

Companies are failing to produce the skilled workers needed to ensure standards are met in areas like safety at a time when scrutiny is intensifying around the world and lapses are met with greater criticism, said Parissa Haghirian, professor of Japanese management at Sophia University in Tokyo.

“There is a real human resource problem,” she said, with the traditional model of hiring workers straight out of school or university, teaching them on the job and rotating them between departments no longer functioning well.

AFTERTHOUGHT

With the ratio of companies complaining of labor shortages at a 25-year high and with firms needing specialists but failing to produce them internally, competition for skilled workers is likely to become more fierce, Haghirian said.

“I predict high performers will leave more quickly... leaving companies in trouble because these people traditionally would stay and drag everyone else along,” she said.

Japanese companies are not alone in being caught up in scandals, with European and U.S. companies caught cutting corners and manipulating results in areas like vehicle emissions tests to the sale of meat. But the Japanese firms face questions over whether they can adapt quickly enough.

Some Japanese makers have taken the attitude that “because the factory floor is well run, quality control and inspection can be applied as an afterthought,” said Tadashi Kunihiro, a lawyer who is a director and auditor on company boards.

Companies, he said, were not placing their most skilled workers in quality control roles.

While safety lapses have been going on at some companies for years or even decades, the decline of the lifetime employment system has likely sapped the loyalty of workers who are more likely to raise concerns themselves, Kunihiro added.

Improving transparency at companies has been a key plank of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s corporate governance reforms through measures such as boosting the number of outside directors.

But experts question whether such reforms can do much to prevent safety scandals occurring in the first place.

“Even if there are more outside directors, if there is cheating on the factory floor there is no way they will be able find out,” a senior executive in the aluminum industry said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

“Even executives don’t know what’s happening on the factory floor,” he said.

Executives are guilty of becoming too detached from the operational side of the business, said Toshiyuki Shimegi, president of Porsche Japan.

“There is a need for more micromanagement,” he said on the sidelines of the Tokyo Motor Show. “They are missing the hands-on approach.”",Japan Inc.'s safety failures point to deeper malaise,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kobe-steel-scandal-workers-analysis/japan-inc-s-safety-failures-point-to-deeper-malaise-idUKKBN1CY05B

Morneau, who was named finance minister shortly after his election to Parliament, said last week he would put his assets in a blind trust and divest his stockholding in the family business in response to criticism that his proposals for pension or tax reform could benefit his company and his personal finances.

On Thursday, Morneau said he will donate to charity any profit that his Morneau Shepell shares have made since he was elected.

The company’s stock, currently trading at C$21.17, closed at C$15.77 in the session before the election, which would put the potential profit for the 1 million shares Morneau has said he holds at C$5.4 million.

Morneau told reporters on Thursday he did not know what the difference in the value of the shares will be.

The law, which President Donald Trump signed on Aug. 2, requires sanctions on individuals who engage in “a significant transaction” with the Russian entities.

Friday’s action does not itself impose new sanctions, and determinations will be made on a case by case basis, State Department officials said.

Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have complained that Trump has been tardy in enforcing the law, which required the list of Russian entities be ready by Oct. 1.

The list includes major Russian arms makers as well as Rosoboronexport, the state-run Russian arms exporter. Also listed is the St. Petersburg-based Special Technology Center, which former President Barack Obama sanctioned in December, saying it played a role in Moscow’s hacking and other interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Russia has denied such meddling.

State Department officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, indicated the Trump administration would move carefully in imposing sanctions and dealing with issues such as U.S. allies who buy Russian-made weaponry or spare parts.

“There is a significance threshold that would exclude certain things that are less than significant,” one official said. “Obviously we’re going to consider the totality of circumstances.”

State Department guidance released on Friday says that in determining whether a transaction is “significant,” officials would weigh its impact on U.S. national security; its size and scope; and the importance of the deal to Russia’s defense and intelligence sector.

The law requires Trump to impose sanctions by Jan. 29 on transactions that are found to meet the definition and which took place after he signed the legislation in August.

“We’ll be implementing the sanctions legislation robustly, in keeping with our understanding of Congress’ intent and the facts that precipitated that legislation, including interference in our election,” a second State Department official said.

The same official did not dispute a report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had eliminated a department office charged with coordinating economic sanctions. The office traditionally had been led by a senior U.S. diplomat.

The official added that individuals throughout the department work on sanctions and that coordination of such work would continue.","U.S. State Department names Russian defense, intel firms under sanctions law",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/u-s-state-department-names-russian-defense-intel-firms-under-sanctions-law-idUSKBN1CW2XR?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Despite deep capital spending cuts and a refocusing on projects that can generate faster paybacks in recent years, the results on Friday showed the pair, neither of whom hedge oil output, are still at the mercy of price gyrations.

Exxon and Chevron have pointed to aggressive plans for boosting low-cost U.S. shale production. But in recent quarters total output at both has atrophied and shale is unlikely to deliver a marked lift until the next decade, based on corporate projections.

“Both are trying to be disciplined and show growth,” said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst with Edward Jones. “But it’s a little bit of a transition, especially as they’re trying to increase shale (output).”

The pair reported the same day as French rival Total SA posted a 29 percent jump in its third-quarter net profit as project ramp-ups and new investments lifted production.

Exxon, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly, said its Permian oil production will grow 45 percent each year through 2020, to more than 400,000 barrels per day. The company also has a large shale position in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation.

Still, Exxon said higher prices contributed $860 million to its earnings while volume increases added only $20 million to the latest quarter’s exploration profit. Exxon’s total output in the quarter was the lowest this year.

Also on Friday Exxon, part of a consortium with Norway’s Statoil and Portugal’s Petrogal, a unit of Galp Energia, won one of four blocks in Brazil’s coveted pre-salt oil region in an auction.

Exxon stock edged up 0.1 percent to $83.53 on Friday afternoon.

At Chevron, a writedown of its Bangladesh operations and a drop in U.S. production weighed on results, which missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin.

Chevron’s stock slid 4.5 percent to $113.15, a drop that surprised Chief Executive Officer John Watson, he said during an investors conference call.

The San Ramon, California, company, which has been one of the Permian’s largest acreage holders since the 1930s, has only recently begun to aggressively develop its oil reserves there. Watson told Reuters earlier this year the Permian is “very important” in the company’s portfolio.

While the company has yet to forecast 2018 production goals for the Permian, Watson said on Friday that Chevron will grow aggressively in the region.

Chevron’s overall average daily output was up 8 percent over a year ago, but that was largely due to the start of giant natural-gas projects. U.S. oil production at Chevron fell overall, as aging field output offset a jump in Permian production.

With Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw set to take the mound for Sunday’s pivotal Game Five in Houston, the best team in baseball all season are suddenly back on track in their quest for a first World Series title since 1988.

“It’s now a three-game series, and we’ve got our ace going tomorrow. So I know that in our clubhouse we feel good,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.

The Dodgers, who breezed through regular season and into World Series, were staring at a potential 3-1 series deficit until Cody Bellinger’s bat came alive when he doubled and scored the tying run in the seventh inning.

Bellinger, who had been hitless in his previous 13 plate appearances, then put the Dodgers ahead in the ninth with a run-scoring double as part of a five-run inning that was capped by Joc Pederson’s three-run blast.

“We’ve been doing it all year. We’re a super resilient team,” said Bellinger, whose Dodgers are now guaranteed to host a Game Six on Tuesday. “Taking one here to make sure we go back to LA is huge.”

The game had been a tight affair as both teams got stellar outings from their starting pitchers.

Dodgers left-hander Alex Wood was working on a no-hitter when George Springer opened the scoring with a two-out homer in the sixth that ended the pitcher’s night. The Dodgers responded an inning later when a Logan Forsythe scored single Bellinger.

“I was glad to keep us in it long enough to where our bats came alive. That felt like us there those last few innings,” said Wood. “It’s a big win for us. We’ve got our guy going tomorrow, so we’re excited to be able to take it back to LA, too.”

Houston’s Charlie Morgan was nearly as impressive as he allowed just three hits in 6-1/3 innings.

The Astros sent closer Ken Giles out for the ninth and he promptly allowed a single to Corey Seager, a walk to Justin Turner before Bellinger put the Dodgers ahead.

“He hadn’t faced those guys a ton, but they didn’t have good swings against him in LA,” Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Giles. “One ground-ball base hit to start the inning and things sort of sped up on him a little bit, the walk after that.”

With the Astros down to their final strike, Alex Bregman homered to left but it proved too little too late as Houston’s unbeaten home stretch in the postseason ended at seven games.

The mainly French-speaking province last week passed the law which does not specify which face coverings are prohibited but has largely focused debate on the niqab worn by some Muslim women, which covers everything but the eyes.

People affected by the law would include public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, hospital and daycare workers and those dealing with them.

Quebec’s Justice Minister Stephanie Vallee said the province wants to ensure accurate identification and better communication and public safety.

Vallee said women would have to remove their veils when necessary for identification but not for the entirety of a transit ride or other public service. She said no-one would be denied emergency medical care, even if they refused to unveil.

“These are common-sense rules,” Vallee told reporters in Quebec City.

Vallee’s remarks come amid continuing protests against the law, including from Muslim groups and rights advocates. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government has no place dictating what women wear but stopped short of saying Ottawa would challenge the law.

Vallee said those who refused to uncover their faces for religious reasons can apply for accommodation on religious grounds, although it was not immediately clear what that would entail.

Right-wing extremist groups and some local French-speaking media in recent years have targeted Quebec’s Muslims as part of a broader debate on the accommodation of religious and cultural minorities in the province.

The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history.

The Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for this weekend’s attack. The government responded by sacking two of the country’s top security officials.

“So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,” Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters.

At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. And a woman, Madobe Nunow, was beheaded while her “three children were shot dead,” he said.

A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel.

Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said.

The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel’s defenses. Then gunmen stormed the building.

The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.

The government sacked the country’s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, a statement from the prime minister’s office said.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.

“If there’s not the tax cut that everyone is expecting, then the correction could be a whole lot more serious.”","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly pricing in the effect of a corporate tax cut into the shares of U.S. companies, leaving the market primed for a steep sell-off if the Republican-controlled Congress fails to pass one of President Donald Trump’s top priorities.

FILE PHOTO: A street sign is seen in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New York, February 10, 2009. REUTERS/Eric Thayer (UNITED STATES)

The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX is up nearly 6 percent from its August lows as the Trump administration has rolled out its tax reform proposal, which would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from the current 35 percent and allow companies to bring back some of the $2.6 trillion in cash currently held offshore at reduced rates.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that a positive boost from taxes “had been priced out of stocks” in July but “has been making a solid comeback.”

Yet there are signs that the Trump administration has little room for error as it gets ready to introduce its tax legislation next week. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget measure on Thursday necessary for a vote on a tax bill, with Republicans from such high-tax states as New York and New Jersey among the opponents out of concerns that a bill would eliminate the deduction of state and local taxes.

Trump must also stem potential revolts over a proposal to scale back the level of tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans, which many middle-class Americans rely on for their retirement.

“The nature of the rally over the last two months has been tax-cut led. If we don’t get a cut then the market is going down” several percentage points, said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.

Such a decline would be the first significant sell-off of the year, he said, but would not likely be near the 20 percent decline that signifies the start of a bear market.

A collapse in the tax measure would likely send the S&P 500 down 5 percent or more, Goldman Sachs said in an Oct. 20 note.

“Tax reform will determine the direction of the S&P 500’s next 100 points,” the report said.

Over the last 30 days, roughly 75 companies - ranging from delivery service United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) - have discussed how they would benefit from a corporate tax cut on conference calls with analysts, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings call transcripts, a sign that Wall Street is increasingly focused on the tax bill.

The White House’s plan would boost 2018 S&P 500 adjusted earnings per share by 12 percent, to $156, Goldman Sachs estimates, while leading to an additional $75 billion in stock buybacks.

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said that Trump’s clashes over the last week with members of his own party could threaten the tax bill’s success because it could alienate other Republicans. Because Republicans hold only a slim 52-48 seat advantage in the Senate, Trump can afford to lose only two votes.

“When the possibility of a defection of some Republican senators increases, that kind of puts the whole tax reform thing in jeopardy. He needs them all,” Tuz said.

At the same time, the 14.4 percent year-to-date rally in the S&P 500 leaves the index primed for a decline of at least 5 percent, said Barry James, a co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund (GLRBX.O).

The S&P 500 trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 22.6, and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, both well above their historical norms.

“We’re at levels today that are historically very risky for stocks and we’re primed for a correction,” James said. “If there’s not the tax cut that everyone is expecting, then the correction could be a whole lot more serious.”","As Trump tax comes to floor, failure could spell stocks selloff",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/as-trump-tax-comes-to-floor-failure-could-spell-stocks-selloff-idUSKBN1CW1EV?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

(Reuters) - About 300 white nationalists and neo-Nazis held back-to-back rallies in two small Tennessee cities on Saturday to protest refugee resettlement in the state, which sued the federal government over the issue earlier this year.

The “White Lives Matter” rallies in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, organized by some of the same groups involved in a Virginia march that turned violent in August, drew an equal number of counter-demonstrators and a heavy police presence.

The protesters started in Shelbyville, then traveled about 35 miles north to Murfreesboro for a second rally. Both towns are near Nashville, center of a metropolitan area has become home to refugees from Somalia, Iraq and elsewhere.

“We don’t want the federal government to keep dumping all these refugees into middle Tennessee,” said Brad Griffin, a member of a group known as the League of the South who has written about his desire to create a white “ethnostate.”

Saturday’s rallies were organized by the Nationalist Front coalition, which embraces groups considered neo-Nazi or neo-Confederate by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups.

To help keep the peace, Shelbyville police used temporary fencing to separate the white nationalists from counter-demonstrators. Anyone seeking to enter the area was searched. Guns, backpacks, sticks and other items that might double as weapons were banned.

The white nationalist demonstrators gathered behind a half dozen white shields emblazoned with red crosses. Counter-protesters carried signs with slogans including “Don’t Hate” and “Veterans for Peace.” Two lines of police, some in riot gear, stood between the two sides, who shouted at each other.

One man was arrested for disorderly conduct, but there were no injuries, local media said. The reports could not be immediately confirmed.

Later in Murfreesboro, where protesters were prohibited from carrying shields, or wearing masks or helmets, the rally remained peaceful, the city said on Twitter.

Local officials and faith leaders had denounced the gatherings, fearing they could inflame racial, ethnic and religious animosities in the state.

Over the last 15 years, about 18,000 refugees have been resettled in Tennessee, less than 1 percent of the state’s population, according to the Tennessean newspaper.

The state filed a lawsuit the federal government in March saying it had been unduly forced to pay for refugee resettlements. It was the first state to bring such a case on the basis of the 10th Amendment, which limits U.S. government powers to those provided by the Constitution. Other states have filed similar suits on different legal grounds.

“When they say refugees, what they really mean is Muslims,” said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, referring to Saturday’s protesters.

He noted that a Murfreesboro mosque has been a source of controversy and vandalism for years.

“Tennessee is one of the states that has seen a rise in anti-Muslim bigotry in recent years, particularly since the election,” Hooper said.

President Donald Trump has sought to ban travel from six Muslim-majority countries since he took office and called during his 2016 election campaign for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”",White nationalists stage anti-refugee protests in Tennessee,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennessee-protests/white-nationalists-stage-anti-refugee-protests-in-tennessee-idUSKBN1CX0BZ

The “Greater Jerusalem” legislation would put some settlements in the occupied West Bank, built on land Palestinians seek for a future state and viewed as illegal by most countries, under the jurisdiction of Jerusalem’s municipality.

The bill, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, was to have been submitted for approval on Sunday to a ministerial committee on legislation, a first step before a series of ratification votes in parliament.

But Likud lawmaker David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu’s coalition in parliament, said a vote by the cabinet committee would be delayed because Washington told Israel the bill’s passage could impede U.S. efforts to revive peace talks that collapsed in 2014.

“There is American pressure that claims this is about annexation and that this could interfere with the peace process,” Bitan told Army Radio.

“The prime minister doesn’t think this is about annexation. I don’t think so either. We have to take the time to clarify matters to the Americans. Therefore, if the bill passes in a week, or in a month, it’s less problematic,” he said.

Proponents of the legislation say it falls short of formal land annexation to Israel but will enable some 150,000 settlers to vote in Jerusalem city elections. Intelligence Minister Israel Katz, a supporter of the bill, has said this would “ensure a Jewish majority in a united Jerusalem”.

Israel’s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector it captured along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a 1967 Middle East war, has not won international recognition. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Israeli media reports said the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, had conveyed misgivings about the legislation, under which the large Maale Adumim and Beitar Illit settlements would become part of a Greater Jerusalem municipality.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as telling cabinet ministers on Sunday: “The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was all about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth continuing to talk and coordinate with them.”

A U.S. embassy spokeswoman declined immediate comment.

MILANO, 26 ottobre (Reuters) - I commissari straordinari di Alitalia non hanno alcuna preclusione nei confronti dell‘operatore di private Cerberus.

E’ quanto dice, in un‘intervista al Sole 24 Ore, Stefano Paleari, uno dei tre commissari impegnati a garantire la continuità aziendale della compagnia aerea e, contemporaneamente, a venderla.

“Con Cerberus abbiamo avuto incontri”, rivela Paleari, “e i rappresentanti del fondo hanno avuto accesso alla dataroom ... Siamo lusingati per ogni soggetto che abbia manifestato interesse”.

Dunque, nessuna preclusione nei confronti dei soggetti non industriali? “Assolutamente no”, risponde Paleari. “Alitalia ha bisogno di un azionista stabile e con adeguate risorse da investire per lo sviluppo. Non conta se a comprare sia un fondo di private equity come Cerberus o un grande vettore internazionale”.

Per quanto riguarda il processo di risanamento di Alitalia, Paleari anticipa che “il secondo semestre del 2017 si chiuderà con un ebitda in sostanziale pareggio”. E ancora: “Entreremo nel 2018 con una dotazione finanziaria di oltre 800 milioni, di poco inferiore al prestito ponte ricevuto. Non solo: i ricavi per la prima volta da alcuni anni sono tornati a crescere e siamo riusciti a tagliare nel complesso oltre 120 milioni di costi operativi su base annua”. Insomma, “possiamo garantire già ora la continuità aziendale per il 2018”.

Paleari, però, si lamenta dei “costi esterni che gravano su Alitalia”. E riserva una critica ad AdR (Atlantia: la compagnia paga “oltre 200 milioni all‘aeroporto di Fiumicino... siamo costretti a sostenere costi crescenti pur restando a parità di servizi”. Pertanto, il commissario chiede una discussione “su come arrivare ad una competizione (nei trasporti) su basi più equilibrate e paritarie”. “Quello del commissario straordinario Paleari è un discorso relativo ai costi sostenuti dalla compagnia aerea. Con Adr c‘è un costante dialogo nella ricerca delle migliori soluzioni per la soddisfazione dell‘utente e la crescita del traffico aereo italiano” precisa l‘ufficio stampa Alitalia.

Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement.

He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,” Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.

The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.

Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.

“You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?” Rouhani said.

“Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.

IAEA HEAD VISITS

Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.

“Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,” it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.

“For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.”

Trump’s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano’s agency is in charge of policing.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal.

Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano: “He has no request in this area,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America’s preferred course.","Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-missiles/rouhani-says-iran-will-keep-producing-missiles-state-tv-reports-idUSKBN1CY04S

The “Greater Jerusalem” legislation would put some settlements in the occupied West Bank, built on land Palestinians seek for a future state and viewed as illegal by most countries, under the jurisdiction of Jerusalem’s municipality.

The bill, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, was to have been submitted for approval on Sunday to a ministerial committee on legislation, a first step before a series of ratification votes in parliament.

But Likud lawmaker David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu’s coalition in parliament, said a vote by the cabinet committee would be delayed because Washington told Israel the bill’s passage could impede U.S. efforts to revive peace talks that collapsed in 2014.

“There is American pressure that claims this is about annexation and that this could interfere with the peace process,” Bitan told Army Radio.

“The prime minister doesn’t think this is about annexation. I don’t think so either. We have to take the time to clarify matters to the Americans. Therefore, if the bill passes in a week, or in a month, it’s less problematic,” he said.

Proponents of the legislation say it falls short of formal land annexation to Israel but will enable some 150,000 settlers to vote in Jerusalem city elections. Intelligence Minister Israel Katz, a supporter of the bill, has said this would “ensure a Jewish majority in a united Jerusalem”.

Israel’s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector it captured along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a 1967 Middle East war, has not won international recognition. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Israeli media reports said the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, had conveyed misgivings about the legislation, under which the large Maale Adumim and Beitar Illit settlements would become part of a Greater Jerusalem municipality.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as telling cabinet ministers on Sunday: “The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was all about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth continuing to talk and coordinate with them.”

A U.S. embassy spokeswoman declined immediate comment.

The comments presage a fight over what Nasdaq described as $300,000 profit generated each month by the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK.P), a one-time collaboration between a group now owned by Nasdaq, PureShares LLC and ETF Managers Group LLC (ETFMG).

Nasdaq on Thursday sued ETFMG, run by Samuel Masucci, saying it stole the ETF and several others. PureShares also sued ETFMG in May. ETFMG has called both lawsuits frivolous.

Launched in 2014, HACK was among a relatively small group of ETFs that found success despite lacking the support of asset managers like BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group, a handful of which attract the majority of ETF assets.

Smaller companies with ideas for new ETFs can take them to “white-label” providers like Summit, New Jersey-based ETFMG, who help get those products up and running.

The dispute over HACK is revealing the intensity of the steeplechase for a rare blockbuster ETF idea as more investors have flocked to lower-cost index funds. PureShares has said verdicts on the lawsuits could change the way ETF managers do business.

In an interview, Masucci said Nasdaq was failing to actively research and update the index of mostly technology stocks the fund tracked before being removed as index provider this summer. He said that may have caused the fund to lag a rival product, First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR.O), that tracks a different Nasdaq index.

“They were not managing the index as the methodology said they would,” said Masucci. “I don’t think they were doing research on it.”

Nasdaq declined to comment, but said in its complaint that Masucci and ETFMG concocted frivolous reasons to take control of HACK and other ETFs. Nasdaq also said it spent “millions” of dollars between 2012 and 2017 to support the fund and honored its obligations.

HACK delivered a 14.5 percent total return for the year ended July 31, when the Nasdaq index was replaced, short of the 16.9 percent return of CIBR. HACK has continued to lag CIBR in the nearly three months since Nasdaq was removed, though Masucci said it holds stocks that are more “liquid,” easier to buy and sell.

Masucci said Nasdaq also pushed back against plans to cut the fund’s fees, a move that could help the fund perform better.

Chief executive officer Timotheus Hoettges also urged the new German government to think twice before selling down its large stake in Deutsche Telekom, according to an interview in Welt am Sonntag.

T-Mobile US, majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, is close to agreeing tentative terms on a deal to merge with Sprint Corp, people familiar with the matter have said, a breakthrough in efforts to merge the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers.

Hoettges, in the interview published on Sunday, declined to comment directly on talks between the companies.

“In the U.S. there is a duopoly between two very big players, and then there are two smaller players well behind,” he said. “A third strong player would be good for competition.”

Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N) are the two largest wireless carriers.

Competition regulators have in the past quashed consolidation efforts by T-Mobile, but Hoettges said chances are now better under U.S. President Donald Trump.

“History has taught us that governments led by Republicans are more hands-off than Democratic administrations,” he said.

On the German state’s nearly 32 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom, Hoettges acknowledged it would be the new government’s decision whether to sell or keep.

But he said those who argued for a sale “should perhaps ask themselves who will buy the stake”.

“What interest would the owner have in infrastructure security? Would the owner want to invest in Germany, and if so, where and in particular, how much?”

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

No. 2: A woman walks across the campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts May 16, 2012. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

“At least we have something left,” he said, standing in a room with clothes, toys, ornaments and damaged pictures strewn across the floor.

“Others have nothing. They lost their homes, they lost their lives.”

Ismail, 44, the Imam of a nearby mosque, considers himself one of the luckiest people in Marawi. The city was devastated by more than 150 days of battles between government forces and pro-Islamic State militants that killed more than 1,100 people and displaced some 350,000.

His house is in Marawi’s safe zone, an area long abandoned by residents but untouched by unrelenting shelling and military air strikes that have all but flattened the city’s commercial heart, destroying thousands of homes, shops and vehicles.

Six days after troops killed the last remaining rebels, Ismail was among about 4,000 people allowed to return to their homes on Sunday in Marawi’s Basak Malutlot area.

Many like him have discovered their houses were looted and left in disarray.

“I opened the door and I was shocked, but I‘m still happy to be home,” he said.

Ismail fled with his family on May 24 during a fierce three-day firefight that erupted just 50 meters away, when security forces tried to raid the hideout of notorious militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State’s anointed “emir” in Southeast Asia.

Hapilon escaped, then issued a call to arms to hundreds of insurgents to initiate their planned takeover of Marawi. It sparked the Philippines’ biggest urban battle in recent history, and fears that Islamic State’s extremist agenda had gained a foothold in the south of the mainly Catholic country.

HAPPY HOMECOMING

There were scenes of joy and chaos as a convoy of returning residents poured in to Marawi to a cacophony of horns and whistles, jamming what only a few hours earlier were deserted streets.

The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX is up nearly 6 percent from its August lows as the Trump administration has rolled out its tax reform proposal, which would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from the current 35 percent and allow companies to bring back some of the $2.6 trillion in cash currently held offshore at reduced rates.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that a positive boost from taxes “had been priced out of stocks” in July but “has been making a solid comeback.”

Yet there are signs that the Trump administration has little room for error as it gets ready to introduce its tax legislation next week. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget measure on Thursday necessary for a vote on a tax bill, with Republicans from such high-tax states as New York and New Jersey among the opponents out of concerns that a bill would eliminate the deduction of state and local taxes.

Trump must also stem potential revolts over a proposal to scale back the level of tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans, which many middle-class Americans rely on for their retirement.

“The nature of the rally over the last two months has been tax-cut led. If we don’t get a cut then the market is going down” several percentage points, said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.

Such a decline would be the first significant sell-off of the year, he said, but would not likely be near the 20 percent decline that signifies the start of a bear market.

A collapse in the tax measure would likely send the S&P 500 down 5 percent or more, Goldman Sachs said in an Oct. 20 note.

“Tax reform will determine the direction of the S&P 500’s next 100 points,” the report said.

Over the last 30 days, roughly 75 companies - ranging from delivery service United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) - have discussed how they would benefit from a corporate tax cut on conference calls with analysts, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings call transcripts, a sign that Wall Street is increasingly focused on the tax bill.

The White House’s plan would boost 2018 S&P 500 adjusted earnings per share by 12 percent, to $156, Goldman Sachs estimates, while leading to an additional $75 billion in stock buybacks.

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said that Trump’s clashes over the last week with members of his own party could threaten the tax bill’s success because it could alienate other Republicans. Because Republicans hold only a slim 52-48 seat advantage in the Senate, Trump can afford to lose only two votes.

“When the possibility of a defection of some Republican senators increases, that kind of puts the whole tax reform thing in jeopardy. He needs them all,” Tuz said.

At the same time, the 14.4 percent year-to-date rally in the S&P 500 leaves the index primed for a decline of at least 5 percent, said Barry James, a co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund (GLRBX.O).

The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history.

The Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for this weekend’s attack. The government responded by sacking two of the country’s top security officials.

“So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,” Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters.

At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. And a woman, Madobe Nunow, was beheaded while her “three children were shot dead,” he said.

A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel.

Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said.

The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel’s defenses. Then gunmen stormed the building.

The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.

The government sacked the country’s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, a statement from the prime minister’s office said.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.

”After the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces.

Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. The government and al Shabaab typically give different figures for victims in such attacks.

The twin bombings in Mogadishu on Oct. 14 killed at least 358 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history, igniting nationwide outrage. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but the method - a large truck bomb - is one it has often used.

The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug.

CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No. 3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday. It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize.

If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.

“It’s an alternate model at this point. It’s not clear that it’s definitely a better one,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said. “More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.”

For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.

But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies.

UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.

Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path. It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years. That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.

CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp. If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cigna’s interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.

Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.

The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.

Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.

SWINGING PENDULUM

Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.

Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.

UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.

Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.

Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.

But with those profits in hand, and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending, they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits, Leerink’s Gupta said.

Another potential lure of a deal for Aetna would be to capitalize on the growing number of simple health services offered in a CVS store, from flu shots to blood pressure checks. Reimbursing such patient care outside of a doctor’s office or hospital could cut healthcare costs, Gupta said.",CVS bid for Aetna: A $66 billion bet on cutting drug costs,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-insurers/cvs-bid-for-aetna-a-66-billion-bet-on-cutting-drug-costs-idUSKBN1CY0EI?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

“At least we have something left,” he said, standing in a room with clothes, toys, ornaments and damaged pictures strewn across the floor.

“Others have nothing. They lost their homes, they lost their lives.”

Ismail, 44, the Imam of a nearby mosque, considers himself one of the luckiest people in Marawi. The city was devastated by more than 150 days of battles between government forces and pro-Islamic State militants that killed more than 1,100 people and displaced some 350,000.

His house is in Marawi’s safe zone, an area long abandoned by residents but untouched by unrelenting shelling and military air strikes that have all but flattened the city’s commercial heart, destroying thousands of homes, shops and vehicles.

Six days after troops killed the last remaining rebels, Ismail was among about 4,000 people allowed to return to their homes on Sunday in Marawi’s Basak Malutlot area.

Many like him have discovered their houses were looted and left in disarray.

“I opened the door and I was shocked, but I‘m still happy to be home,” he said.

Ismail fled with his family on May 24 during a fierce three-day firefight that erupted just 50 meters away, when security forces tried to raid the hideout of notorious militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State’s anointed “emir” in Southeast Asia.

Hapilon escaped, then issued a call to arms to hundreds of insurgents to initiate their planned takeover of Marawi. It sparked the Philippines’ biggest urban battle in recent history, and fears that Islamic State’s extremist agenda had gained a foothold in the south of the mainly Catholic country.

Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement.

He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,” Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.

The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.

Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.

“You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?” Rouhani said.

“Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.

IAEA HEAD VISITS

Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.

“Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,” it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.

“For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.”

Trump’s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano’s agency is in charge of policing.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal.

Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano: “He has no request in this area,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America’s preferred course.","Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CY04S-OCATP

The private sector bank is still waiting for the final report of the central bank’s annual supervision exercise, Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar told reporters on a conference call, adding they will disclose the findings of this audit in the third quarter.

As part of this review, the central bank looks to see if banks have correctly classified loans, taking into account repayment trends and other factors.

A record $145 billion soured loans due to an economic slowdown and, in some cases, profligate lending has stifled new bank credit in India. But private sector banks have been able to gain market share from their dominant state-run rivals which account for bulk of the troubled loans.

But some of ICICI’s private sector rivals have disclosed additional bad loans following a central bank audit of their books for the last financial year.

A $32 billion recapitalisation for the state-run banks announced this week also risks curtailing the private-sector banks’ competitive advantage and their higher valuations.

Kochhar reiterated that the bank expected total bad loan additions in the current financial year to March to be lower than last year. She forecast domestic loan growth in the financial year to be about 15 percent, led by as much 20 percent rise in retail loans.

ICICI, among the three domestic banks considered “too big to fail” by the country’s central bank, reported a net profit of 20.58 billion rupees ($316.51 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30, missing analysts’ expectations of 24.91 billion rupees.

Non-interest income in the quarter included gains of 20.12 billion rupees from sale of stake in the initial public offering of unit ICICI Lombard General Insurance, ICICI said, lower than 56.82 billion rupees raked in from the stake sale in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance in the year ago quarter.

ICICI, which has the highest bad loans in absolute terms among private-sector lenders in the country, said its total provisions, including for loan losses, were 45.03 billion rupees in the September quarter, higher than 26.09 billion rupees three months ago, but 36 percent lower than a year ago.

Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans stood at 7.87 percent at end-September, versus 7.99 percent at end-June and 6.12 percent a year ago. Net interest income and fee income rose by 9 percent each in the quarter.

On October 5, the militant group lost the northern town of Hawija – its last urban stronghold after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul and Tal Afar earlier this year. The brutal battles for these cities have been well documented. Less noticed, however, has been how the near-total defeat of IS is reshaping political and sectarian alliances in the region.

The rise and fall of IS has had a sobering and unifying effect on relationships between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In Iraq, where thousands died in the vicious sectarian war that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, residents of the mainly-Sunni cities of Mosul and Hawija nonetheless jubilantly welcomed the mostly-Shi’ite Iraqi forces who freed the cities from the Sunni extremists of IS. “They helped liberate us,” one Hawija Sunni leader told the New York Times of the fighters. Nor does a Shi’ite backlash against Sunnis seem imminent given Shi’ite recognition of Sunni suffering in the IS-occupied cities.

The IS experience has affected Iranian politics too. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to show a softer attitude toward Sunnis in a rare pronouncement – seen as carrying the weight of a fatwa – publicly prohibiting any discrimination against minorities. Sunnis have fewer rights than Shi’ites in Iran, and Khamenei’s August comment was made in response to an inquiry by Molavi Abdul Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric from Iran's impoverished Sunni-dominated Sistan-Baluchistan province on the Pakistan border. In Syria too, IS's faster-than-expected battlefield defeats suggest that the group does not enjoy much local support among the Sunni tribes and populations it has been ruling for the past couple of years.

The biggest changes can be seen in Iraq, where Shi’ite leaders’ attempts to develop a post-IS foreign policy are driven in part by fear of Iran’s growing influence and in part by the IS-inflicted suffering in Iraq. Many observers believe that the pursuit of sectarian policies at the expense of Iraqi Sunnis – as systematically practiced under the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki – expedited the rise of IS.

The result of the new dynamic is that Iraq’s main Shi’ite leaders are distancing themselves from Iran as they make once-unthinkable overtures to the region’s Sunni Arab bloc. In one of the latest signs of that shift, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi declined Tehran’s official invitation to take part in President Hassan Rouhani’s second-term inauguration ceremony on August 5. Such a refusal would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

Similarly, prominent Shi’ite leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada al-Sadr snubbed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the newly-appointed chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council – a governing body set up to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians over whether planned legislation conforms with Islamic law – during an official visit to Iraq as the envoy of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Sadr said after the meeting that he hoped it was 'the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region.' Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS

Underscoring the point, Baghdad publicly slammed a deal made by Hezbollah, Iran’s chief proxy in the region, to evacuate a group of IS fighters from Lebanon to eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. The Tehran-backed agreement was “unacceptable” and “an insult to the Iraqi people,” Prime Minister Abadi said in August.

Iranian influence on Iraq’s domestic politics is shrinking too. Ammar al-Hakim resigned as head of the Tehran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq – the country’s largest Shi’ite party – a month after a June meeting with Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and an informal advisor to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Hakim promptly went on to form the National Wisdom Movement, a political party to “embrace” all Iraqis.

At the same time, Iran-funded, Shi’ite-dominated militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces are divided over whether they should be integrated into the regular Iraqi army – a measure that would loosen Iran’s foothold in Iraq’s security apparatus – or whether they should remain independent of the Iraqi government. Groups loyal to Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have started taking steps to register with the army; those led by Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization and Qais al-Khazali of Asaib Ahl al-Haq remain in the pro-Iran camp.

Against this backdrop, Iraq is trying to improve its ties with Saudi Arabia. In addition to several recent diplomatic visits between the two countries, including one by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Riyadh, Moqtada al-Sadr – an influential Shi’ite cleric with a large following among Iraq’s urban poor – made rare and well-received visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Sadr issued a statement saying that he was “very pleased with what we found to be a positive breakthrough in the Saudi-Iraqi relations,” and that he hoped it was “the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region."" Sadr’s Aug. 13 meeting with Emirati crown prince Zayed al-Nahayan appeared equally successful. “Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,” Nahyan told Sadr, in a veiled reference to Iran as one of the dividers.

It is clearly in Iraq’s strategic interests to diversify its relationships beyond reflexive sectarian or ideological lines. Improved ties with Riyadh pave the way for Baghdad to receive much-needed financial aid from Saudi Arabia and establish an economic relationship that could help counter the political and military influence established when Iran cultivated Shi’ite proxies to fight U.S.-backed forces in Iraq. The outreach can also signal to Iraq’s Sunni minority that the Baghdad government is not an Iranian stooge.

Iraq’s post-IS foreign policy could have broader regional benefits too. For Riyadh, closer ties with Baghdad can help the Saudi leadership feel less threatened by Iran’s rising influence and the perception that Riyadh’s share of regional power has diminished as a result. That in turn may lead to a thaw in Iranian-Saudi ties and a broader contribution to regional security.

Nonetheless, the fact is that neither Riyadh nor Tehran can achieve sustainable hegemony in the region at the expense of the other. It’s ironic that it may be the routing of extremist IS that serves as the catalyst to ease the bitter sectarian rifts that have divided them for so long.",Commentary: The unlikely – and ironic – effects of Islamic State’s fall in Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afterislamicstate-commentar/commentary-the-unlikely-and-ironic-effects-of-islamic-states-fall-in-iraq-idUSKBN1CU2LW

Mark Garnier, a junior international trade minister, asked secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy two sex toys and he also called her “sugar tits”, the Mail on Sunday reported.

Garnier told the newspaper that the comment was part of an amusing conversation about a television show, and that asking her to buy the toys was “good humored high jinks”.

Edmondson, in comments to the paper, disputed Garnier’s recollection of the incidents, including his assertion that they were “high jinks”.

Garnier was not immediately available for comment to Reuters through his constituency or parliamentary offices.

The report comes after May’s spokeswoman said on Friday any unwanted sexual behavior was “completely unacceptable” and any minister who acted inappropriately would face “serious action”.

She was reacting to a report in another British newspaper that described a culture of sexual harassment among lawmakers and their staff working in parliament.

Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said on Sunday May had asked officials to investigate if Garnier, whose role is outside the cabinet immediately surrounding the May, had broken the government ministers’ code of behavior.

“These stories, if they are true, are obviously totally unacceptable,” Hunt told BBC television.

“The Cabinet Office will be conducting an investigation as to whether there has been a breach of the ministerial code in this particular case, but as you know the facts are disputed.”

May will also write to John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, to ask for his advice about changing the culture there, Hunt said.

Reports of inappropriate behavior in British politics, and in other industries, have followed dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove apologized on Saturday after he likened being interviewed by a BBC radio presenter to entering Weinstein’s bedroom. After the analogy was widely criticized, Gove apologized for what he said was a “clumsy attempt at humor”.

The Sun newspaper said on Friday that women working in politics in Westminster had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators.

“The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics,” May’s spokeswoman said on Friday.",British minister to be investigated over sexual harassment allegation,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-harassment/british-minister-to-be-investigated-over-sexual-harassment-allegation-idUKKBN1CY0HO?il=0

The victims in Poland and the Czech Republic were killed by falling trees. The storm also knocked out power to thousands of Czechs and Poles.

Winds reached more than 100 kph in several parts of the Czech Republic and topped out at 180 kph on Snezka, at 1,602 metres the country’s highest mountain, Czech Television reported.

Bild newspaper reported that a 63-year-old German man drowned at a campsite in Lower Saxony as a result of a storm surge.

In Germany, railway operator Deutsche Bahn cited what it called “significant damage” on main routes, and said rail traffic on many routes in northern and central Germany would remain suspended until Monday.

The decision left thousands of travellers stranded and cut rail access to cities such as Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Hanover and Kiel. The closures also affect popular routes such as from Frankfurt to Berlin and Dortmund to Hamburg.

Hamburg saw widespread flooding in the inner city area, including the area around the new Elbphilharmonie symphony hall.

The winds felled trees in the Czech Republic, with one man dying after being hit on a sidewalk in a town in the north of the country and one woman killed by a tree in a wooded area, media reported.

The weather delayed or halted traffic on several railway lines and slowed road traffic, with a fallen tree blocking one highway just outside of the capital, Prague, the website of newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes reported.

Prague Zoo closed because of the winds, but Prague Airport was running without problems, newspaper Lidove Noviny’s website reported.

The winds also hit Poland, damaging a pipeline at Poland’s liquefied natural gas terminal in the port of Swinoujscie. They caused a small leak but no greater damage, according to a spokesman for the state gas pipeline operator, Gaz-System.","Strong winds batter central Europe, killing at least five",https://in.reuters.com/article/europe-weather/strong-winds-batter-central-europe-killing-at-least-four-idINKBN1CY0CV

The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX is up nearly 6 percent from its August lows as the Trump administration has rolled out its tax reform proposal, which would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from the current 35 percent and allow companies to bring back some of the $2.6 trillion in cash currently held offshore at reduced rates.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that a positive boost from taxes “had been priced out of stocks” in July but “has been making a solid comeback.”

Yet there are signs that the Trump administration has little room for error as it gets ready to introduce its tax legislation next week. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget measure on Thursday necessary for a vote on a tax bill, with Republicans from such high-tax states as New York and New Jersey among the opponents out of concerns that a bill would eliminate the deduction of state and local taxes.

Trump must also stem potential revolts over a proposal to scale back the level of tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans, which many middle-class Americans rely on for their retirement.

“The nature of the rally over the last two months has been tax-cut led. If we don’t get a cut then the market is going down” several percentage points, said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.

Such a decline would be the first significant sell-off of the year, he said, but would not likely be near the 20 percent decline that signifies the start of a bear market.

A collapse in the tax measure would likely send the S&P 500 down 5 percent or more, Goldman Sachs said in an Oct. 20 note.

“Tax reform will determine the direction of the S&P 500’s next 100 points,” the report said.

Over the last 30 days, roughly 75 companies - ranging from delivery service United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) - have discussed how they would benefit from a corporate tax cut on conference calls with analysts, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings call transcripts, a sign that Wall Street is increasingly focused on the tax bill.

The White House’s plan would boost 2018 S&P 500 adjusted earnings per share by 12 percent, to $156, Goldman Sachs estimates, while leading to an additional $75 billion in stock buybacks.

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said that Trump’s clashes over the last week with members of his own party could threaten the tax bill’s success because it could alienate other Republicans. Because Republicans hold only a slim 52-48 seat advantage in the Senate, Trump can afford to lose only two votes.

“When the possibility of a defection of some Republican senators increases, that kind of puts the whole tax reform thing in jeopardy. He needs them all,” Tuz said.

At the same time, the 14.4 percent year-to-date rally in the S&P 500 leaves the index primed for a decline of at least 5 percent, said Barry James, a co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund (GLRBX.O).

The S&P 500 trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 22.6, and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, both well above their historical norms.

“We’re at levels today that are historically very risky for stocks and we’re primed for a correction,” James said. “If there’s not the tax cut that everyone is expecting, then the correction could be a whole lot more serious.”","As Trump tax comes to floor, failure could spell stocks selloff",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/as-trump-tax-comes-to-floor-failure-could-spell-stocks-selloff-idUKKBN1CW1EV

The Luo community largely boycotted Thursday’s election, which was supposed to again pit opposition leader Raila Odinga, a Luo, against President Uhuru Kenyatta, a Kikuyu with a Kalenjin deputy president.

The Supreme Court ordered a repeat after it nullified Kenyatta’s win in an August election on procedural grounds.

The motive and perpetrators for the killing in western Kenya were unclear, but it came a day after villagers from the Luo and Kalenjin communities armed themselves against each other.

The body of 64-year-old George Odumbe, a Luo labourer at the local sugar company, was found with three arrows in the back and severe head wounds, a Reuters witness in the village of Koguta said. It was found in a field between Koguta and the nearby Kalengin village of Mau.

Locals warned the death of the Luo man could spark tit-for-tat violence.

“There’s a desire for revenge by the Luo community, I‘m trying to tell them to stay calm, but they are so bitter and angry,” Gordon Onyango, 32, a Luo, said. “The two sides are both having meetings now and they are both armed.”

Reuters was unable to speak with the Kalenjin community in Mau, but saw a group of young men from the village gathered under a tree. Most were armed with bows and arrows.

Odinga withdrew from the rerun election, saying it would not be fair. In his strongholds in the west, an area that has long felt excluded from political and economic power, protesters prevented polling stations from opening in four counties.

Across Kenya, about 10 percent of polling stations were unable to open, although there were no problems in Kenyatta’s areas. Turnout plummeted to about 35 percent from 80 percent in August, undercutting Kenyata’s hopes for a decisive mandate for a second term.

In some parts of the country, such as Koguta in Kisumu county, protests damaged relations with other communities who wanted to vote for Kenyatta.

That anger risks igniting ethnic violence, which killed around 1,200 people after a disputed 2007 presidential vote, but which has been largely absent from this election.

At least 51 people have been killed in political violence since August, but most deaths have occurred in clashes between protesters and police.

Police, although stationed only 400 metres from where the body was discovered, declined to visit the scene for several hours until reinforcements arrived.

Around five hours after the body was found, police took it to the nearby town of Muhoroni.

Police did not answer calls from Reuters. But Julius Genga, a county legislator, said by phone while he was driving to the scene: “We want the police to be deployed to try to restore calm because after the death of this man, tension is boiling up and we don’t want it to escalate it to unmanageable levels.”

Kericho county governor Paul Chepkwony told Reuters that he hoped the death would be “an isolated one”.

On Saturday when he and the Kisumu county governor visited the area, he said, “We delivered the message, aside from parties or politics, that everyone wants peace. That’s still our message.”",Man killed with arrows in Kenyan village on edge over elections,https://www.reuters.com/article/kenya-election-killings/man-killed-with-arrows-in-kenyan-village-on-edge-over-elections-idINKBN1CY0A4?il=0

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

SLIGHT UNIONIST LEAD

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

Pro-unity supporters take part in a demonstration in central Barcelona, Spain, October 29, 2017. REUTERS/Yves Herman

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Slideshow (3 Images)

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",https://in.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia-poll/first-catalan-poll-gives-slight-lead-to-anti-independence-parties-idINKBN1CY06U

Tony West will join Uber next month from PepsiCo Inc, where as general counsel he led a team of lawyers across more than 200 countries. He was also a former federal prosecutor and senior official in the U.S. Department of Justice under former President Barack Obama.

At Uber, West will contend with a number of criminal probes and one of the biggest legal battles playing out in Silicon Valley, a lawsuit against Uber from Alphabet Inc’s self-driving car unit, Waymo.

“Tony is exactly what Uber needs now,” Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters.

West is the first significant hire for Khosrowshahi, whom the Uber board hired in August after former CEO Travis Kalanick was pressured by investors to resign following a series of company controversies.

Salle Yoo formerly held Uber’s top legal job, but she is departing the company in the coming weeks. Last month, Yoo said she would leave Uber when a new general counsel was hired.

Many of Uber’s senior jobs remain vacant, including chief financial officer, but the general counsel role was among Uber’s most critical to fill. The company faces a long list of legal tangles, including the lawsuit from Waymo that alleges trade-secrets theft; a class-action lawsuit from drivers; and a number of federal investigations that span possible bribery of foreign officials in Asian countries and the use of software to evade regulators.

Earlier this week, three Latina software engineers sued Uber in San Francisco, alleging discrimination based on their gender and race.

During his three-year tenure at Pepsi, West was also one of that company’s leading advocates for diversity, Khosrowshahi said.

While in government, West helped the Justice Department secure a nearly $17 billion settlement with Bank of America over toxic mortgage securities and played an integral role in the 2011 decision by the Obama administration to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages.

West also has family ties to government. He is married to Maya Harris, a former senior adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and his sister-in-law is California Senator Kamala Harris.

His house is in Marawi’s safe zone, an area long abandoned by residents but untouched by unrelenting shelling and military air strikes that have all but flattened the city’s commercial heart, destroying thousands of homes, shops and vehicles.

Ismail fled with his family on May 24 during a fierce three-day firefight that erupted just 50 meters away, when security forces tried to raid the hideout of notorious militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State’s anointed “emir” in Southeast Asia.

Hapilon escaped, then issued a call to arms to hundreds of insurgents to initiate their planned takeover of Marawi. It sparked the Philippines’ biggest urban battle in recent history, and fears that Islamic State’s extremist agenda had gained a foothold in the south of the mainly Catholic country.

Andrew Cuomo of New York and Jerry Brown of California spoke in a joint conference call a day after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure that advanced President Donald Trump’s tax plan.

Republican leaders have sketched out an outline of the tax measures that would eliminate the tax break, although detailed legislation will not be unveiled until next Wednesday.

If the SALT deduction were eliminated the tax package would disproportionately hit residents of states that have high income taxes, many of which are historically Democratic, the governors said.

“This is an attack on California, New York and New Jersey, and other states that would not vote for Trump,” Brown said. “It’s a gross manipulation of our tax code.”

The SALT deduction allows residents to subtract income taxes paid to states and local governments from the total income taxed by the federal government taxes. Its elimination would be one among a series of measures to offset lost revenues from what are envisaged as sweeping overall cuts on corporate and personal taxes.

While analysts say the overall tax package would cut taxes for companies and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, many residents of high-tax states who use the deduction would pay more, the governors said.

In New York, taxpayers would pay an average of an additional $5,300 in federal income taxes a year without the SALT deduction, Cuomo’s office said in a separate statement.

That sharp increase in taxes would likely lead to an exodus of residents, starting with high earners, who would see the greatest increases, Cuomo said. “Higher-income people will move,” he said.

Some Republican lawmakers from high-tax states voted against the budget measure on Thursday to express opposition to the elimination of the SALT deduction. Republican congressional leaders are working to allay their concerns.

“If the SALT is repealed, we would expect some deterioration of credit quality for affected states and localities in the medium term, including some price pressure on housing markets in areas bordering states with lower local taxes (eg, southern New Jersey),” Barclays analysts wrote to clients on Thursday.

“However, municipal bonds issued by high tax states and localities would likely become even more valuable to investors, and there could be stronger demand from retail investors, bringing yields and muni-Treasury ratios down,” Barclays said.","NY, California governors say residents would suffer under Trump tax cuts",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-governors/ny-california-governors-say-residents-would-suffer-under-trump-tax-cuts-idUSKBN1CW2UU

The company’s shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.

Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.

“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.

“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”

The company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

FILE PHOTO: An attendee checks out a new iPhone X during an Apple launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam

Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades.

Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday. The base price for the phone is $999.

He noted that Sprint Corp’s iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.

However, electronics retailer Best Buy Co is charging shoppers an extra $100, if they wish to buy an unactivated iPhone X outright.

King Bhumibol, the world’s longest reigning monarch when he died last year at the age of 88, ruled Thailand from shortly after World War Two and was revered as a stabilizing figure through coups, protests and natural disasters.

Over 19 million Thais - more than a quarter of the 69 million population - participated in ceremonies by presenting symbolic sandalwood flowers to be burned at temples and crematorium replicas across the country, according to the government.

On Sunday, the late king’s bones were moved to the Chakri Throne Hall, where royal relics are kept within the Grand Palace in a ceremony that involved senior monks from temples across the country. His son, new King Maha Vajiralongkorn, led the religious rite.

On Sunday evening, Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana led the final royal procession on horseback to the Wat Rajabopidh and Wat Bovoranives temples where her grandfather’s ashes were placed in keeping with a ceremony steeped in religious symbolism and tradition. Mourners, some in tears, were gathered outside the temples.

“I will always have him stored in my heart. Whether as pictures, however old and torn, the memory of him will always be kept in my heart,” said Chalermporm Prabutr, 72.

REUTERS/Geirix

With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement’s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament.

Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one.

The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom.

Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust.

The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s use of offshore tax havens.

In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world’s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability.

After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties.

The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament’s 63 seats.

“The opposition has a majority, so that’s a message. But we’ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,” Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday.

The Independence Party members and supporters react as they watch the first results of the snap parliamentary election in Reykjavik, Iceland October 28, 2017. REUTERS/Geirix

The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.

The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament.

The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year’s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland’s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters.

Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said: ”I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it’s normal that we should be a part of a future government.

“We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,” he said. “We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.”

His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.

The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year’s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.

“I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,” said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government.

The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes.

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

SLIGHT UNIONIST LEAD

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Slideshow (4 Images)

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia-poll/hundreds-of-thousands-march-for-unified-spain-poll-shows-depths-of-division-idUSKBN1CY072

The “Greater Jerusalem” legislation would put some settlements in the occupied West Bank, built on land Palestinians seek for a future state and viewed as illegal by most countries, under the jurisdiction of Jerusalem’s municipality.

The bill, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, was to have been submitted for approval on Sunday to a ministerial committee on legislation, a first step before a series of ratification votes in parliament.

But Likud lawmaker David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu’s coalition in parliament, said a vote by the cabinet committee would be delayed because Washington told Israel the bill’s passage could impede U.S. efforts to revive peace talks that collapsed in 2014.

“There is American pressure that claims this is about annexation and that this could interfere with the peace process,” Bitan told Army Radio.

“The prime minister doesn’t think this is about annexation. I don’t think so either. We have to take the time to clarify matters to the Americans. Therefore, if the bill passes in a week, or in a month, it’s less problematic,” he said.

Proponents of the legislation say it falls short of formal land annexation to Israel but will enable some 150,000 settlers to vote in Jerusalem city elections. Intelligence Minister Israel Katz, a supporter of the bill, has said this would “ensure a Jewish majority in a united Jerusalem”.

Israel’s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector it captured along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a 1967 Middle East war, has not won international recognition. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Israeli media reports said the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, had conveyed misgivings about the legislation, under which the large Maale Adumim and Beitar Illit settlements would become part of a Greater Jerusalem municipality.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as telling cabinet ministers on Sunday: “The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was all about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth continuing to talk and coordinate with them.”

A U.S. embassy spokeswoman declined immediate comment.

The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug.

CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No. 3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday. It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize.

If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.

“It’s an alternate model at this point. It’s not clear that it’s definitely a better one,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said. “More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.”

For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.

But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies.

UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.

Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path. It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years. That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.

CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp. If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cigna’s interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.

Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.

The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.

Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.

SWINGING PENDULUM

Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.

Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.

UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.

Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.

Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.

But with those profits in hand, and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending, they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits, Leerink’s Gupta said.

Another potential lure of a deal for Aetna would be to capitalize on the growing number of simple health services offered in a CVS store, from flu shots to blood pressure checks. Reimbursing such patient care outside of a doctor’s office or hospital could cut healthcare costs, Gupta said.",CVS bid for Aetna: A $66 billion bet on cutting drug costs,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-insurers/cvs-bid-for-aetna-a-66-billion-bet-on-cutting-drug-costs-idINKBN1CY0EQ?il=0

The Luo community largely boycotted Thursday’s election, which was supposed to again pit opposition leader Raila Odinga, a Luo, against President Uhuru Kenyatta, a Kikuyu with a Kalenjin deputy president.

The Supreme Court ordered a repeat after it nullified Kenyatta’s win in an August election on procedural grounds.

The motive and perpetrators for the killing in western Kenya were unclear, but it came a day after villagers from the Luo and Kalenjin communities armed themselves against each other.

The body of 64-year-old George Odumbe, a Luo labourer at the local sugar company, was found with three arrows in the back and severe head wounds, a Reuters witness in the village of Koguta said. It was found in a field between Koguta and the nearby Kalengin village of Mau.

Locals warned the death of the Luo man could spark tit-for-tat violence.

“There’s a desire for revenge by the Luo community, I‘m trying to tell them to stay calm, but they are so bitter and angry,” Gordon Onyango, 32, a Luo, said. “The two sides are both having meetings now and they are both armed.”

Reuters was unable to speak with the Kalenjin community in Mau, but saw a group of young men from the village gathered under a tree. Most were armed with bows and arrows.

Odinga withdrew from the rerun election, saying it would not be fair. In his strongholds in the west, an area that has long felt excluded from political and economic power, protesters prevented polling stations from opening in four counties.

Across Kenya, about 10 percent of polling stations were unable to open, although there were no problems in Kenyatta’s areas. Turnout plummeted to about 35 percent from 80 percent in August, undercutting Kenyata’s hopes for a decisive mandate for a second term.

In some parts of the country, such as Koguta in Kisumu county, protests damaged relations with other communities who wanted to vote for Kenyatta.

That anger risks igniting ethnic violence, which killed around 1,200 people after a disputed 2007 presidential vote, but which has been largely absent from this election.

At least 51 people have been killed in political violence since August, but most deaths have occurred in clashes between protesters and police.

Police, although stationed only 400 metres from where the body was discovered, declined to visit the scene for several hours until reinforcements arrived.

Around five hours after the body was found, police took it to the nearby town of Muhoroni.

Police did not answer calls from Reuters. But Julius Genga, a county legislator, said by phone while he was driving to the scene: “We want the police to be deployed to try to restore calm because after the death of this man, tension is boiling up and we don’t want it to escalate it to unmanageable levels.”

Kericho county governor Paul Chepkwony told Reuters that he hoped the death would be “an isolated one”.

In the bright green sugarcane fields where the western Nyanza region rolls toward the Nandi hills, two tribes -- the Luo and the Kalenjin -- have lived in relative peace for years.

But in the village of Koguta, down the road from the town of Mugoroni in Kisumu County, Thursday’s polarizing vote reignited old grievances.

The stand-off, defused by an emergency intervention of three county governors, was a stark reminder of how easily Kenya’s months-long political crisis could spark the type of ethnic violence that killed 1,200 people after a flawed 2007 vote.

On one side of Koguta are Kalenjins, here ardent supporters of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Kalenjin deputy, William Ruto. But the Luos across the road support opposition leader Raila Odinga, who called for a boycott of the vote because he said it would not be fair.

Some of the Luos here fought police to stop ballot boxes being delivered. The Luo accused the Kalenjin of stealing cattle and burning their sugarcane crop in revenge, prompting both sides to grab machetes, spears, bows and arrows, and wooden clubs.

“This is an area where they tried to come in with ballot boxes, there was serious resistance, so that was the genesis of all this enmity between the Kalenjins and the Luos,” said Julius Genga, a county legislator, as a colleague stood atop a sports utility vehicle to calm a crowd of men with spears.

The opposition dismissed the vote as a “sham” although Kenyatta’s supporters say it was legitimate. Protests stopped four counties from opening polling stations at all. Only a third of voters turned up, and the opposition is likely to challenge the poll in court.

“This has to do with politics,” said Collins Owuor, 21, holding a machete. “Before politics we did not have problems with these people.”

In the distance, where smoke rose from sugarcane fields, Reuters saw police speaking to spear-wielding Kalenjins, but the local police chief warned journalists away.

By the end of the afternoon’s meetings, the cattle had been returned and officials said they hoped the risk of violence had been quelled.

ELECTORAL SAGA

Koguta is not the only place where simmering ethnic tensions have broken into the open.

On Friday night in the Nairobi slum of Kawangware, a man was beaten to death and homes and shop burned down amid rumors that a TRIBAL militia had infiltrated the neighborhood of a different tribe.

In Thursday’s vote, Kenyatta only faced six minor candidates, none of whom won more than 1 percent in August, and that and the low turnout have quashed his hopes of securing a decisive mandate to lead east Africa’s richest economy.

Deputy president William Ruto, Kenyatta’s running mate, told CNN on Saturday he expected the final tally from the vote to be ready by Sunday:

“Shortly we will be having a declaration and finally a swearing in, in accordance with the constitution.”

The election board said on Saturday it would soon announce a new plan for the nearly 30 of 290 constituencies that have not voted yet. The constitution says the vote must be held in every constituency.

More legal cases against the election are expected next week.

If the courts fail to find a path out of the crisis, including a possible order for another rerun, the protracted and economically damaging stalemate between the Kenyatta and Odinga camps is likely to continue.

The electoral saga is polarizing the nation and slowing growth in what has been one of Africa’s most vibrant economies, which is also a regional trade hub and a security ally for Western nations.

In Odinga strongholds, residents accused authorities of trying to “force” voter participation.

“This is pure oppression,” said Hassan Hussein, a Muslim community leader. “The law says if you want to vote, you vote, if not, you don‘t.”","In Kenya, polarizing election re-run rekindles ethnic tensions",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CX07W-OZATP

Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement.

He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,” Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.

The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.

Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.

“You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?” Rouhani said.

“Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.

Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.

“Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,” it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.

“For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.”

Trump’s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano’s agency is in charge of policing.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal.

Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano: “He has no request in this area,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America’s preferred course.","Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear-missiles/rouhani-says-iran-will-keep-producing-missiles-state-tv-reports-idUKKBN1CY04N?il=0

FILE PHOTO: Akzo Nobel's logo is seen in Amsterdam, Netherlands, February 16, 2012. REUTERS/Robin van Lonkhuijsen/United Photos/File Photo

Akzo Nobel’s move indicates that its new CEO Thierry Vanlancker is continuing to look for big deals as a way to buttress the company, after it managed to fend off a takeover approach by PPG Industries (PPG.N) earlier this year.

Philadelphia-based Axalta is in the early stages of considering a deal with Akzo Nobel, and there is no certainty that the two companies will agree to a merger, one of the sources said on Friday.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Akzo Nobel and Axalta did not respond to requests for comment.

Shares in Axalta soared nearly 22 percent on the news and were last up 18 percent at $33.27 in early afternoon trading, giving the company a market capitalization of $8.1 billion. Akzo Nobel’s shares had finished flat in Amsterdam, valuing it at 19.5 billion euros.

Earlier this year, the Dutch maker of Dulux rejected a 26-billion euro acquisition offer from U.S. rival PPG. As an alternative transaction, Akzo Nobel has announced it plans to sell or spin off its specialty chemicals division, which represents about a third of sales and profits.

Such a divestiture will concentrate Akzo on coatings, and so a tie-up with Axalta, the No. 1 supplier to the North American heavy truck market, would round out its business to include vehicle coatings.

PPG CEO Michael McGarry said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call earlier this month that, when it came to Akzo Nobel, PPG had “moved on.” A PPG spokesman declined to comment on Friday on how the company will respond to Akzo Nobel’s merger discussions with Axalta.

A tie-up with Axalta, the former car paint unit of DuPont, is be the major first merger being pursued by Vanlancker, who took over as Akzo Nobel CEO when Ton Buechner resigned for health reasons in July.

Vanlancker has cut Buechner’s profit goals, made in the heat of the takeover battle, twice in the space of six weeks, blaming disruption caused by hurricane Harvey, rising raw materials costs and “headwinds” at its marine coatings business.

He has also focused on trying to cultivate Akzo Nobel’s investor base. Having won a court case in which activist investor Elliott Advisors sought but failed to get the removal of president Antony Burgmans, Akzo Nobel pledged to mend its relationship with shareholders.

Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), Axalta’s former owner, had considered selling the company to Akzo in 2014 before taking it public.",Exclusive: Akzo Nobel approaches Axalta about possible merger - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-axalta-akzonobel/exclusive-akzo-nobel-approaches-axalta-about-possible-merger-sources-idUSKBN1CW2FO

Nemo, the young dog adopted this year by France’s Emmanuel Macron, was caught on camera relieving himself on a gilded fireplace in the Elysee Palace behind a group of junior ministers meeting with the president.

The footage, captured by French TV channel TF1, showed Nemo interrupting the gathering as the sound of him peeing caused those present to turn around before they started giggling.

“He’s doing something quite exceptional,” a laughing Macron said.

Asked by junior minister for housing Julien Denormandie whether it was something that happened often, Macron added: “No ... you’ve triggered some completely unusual behavior in my dog, sorry.”

Nemo, a black labrador-griffon cross, was adopted by Macron and his wife Brigitte from a shelter home in August.

The investment bank, which UBS has scaled back in recent years to free up resources for wealth management, saw adjusted pretax operating profit rise 2.9 percent to 352 million francs.
A drop in the second quarter CET1 ratio had been a source of concern for some investors.
“That ratio is clearly good for all those who want to make a dividend story out of UBS,” said Brun.","ZURICH (Reuters) - A pick-up at UBS’s (UBSG.S) core wealth management business is likely to weaken in the final months of 2017 as clients withdraw money to take part in tax amnesty programs, the world’s biggest private bank said.

UBS, which manages more than more than $2 trillion of the world’s wealth, saw continued improvement in the third quarter at its flagship business after a sluggish 2016 in which trading activity by rich clients hit a record low.

But finance chief Kirt Gardner said the fourth quarter, traditionally a seasonally slow three months, would be hit by an estimated 8 billion Swiss francs ($8 billion) in withdrawals as wealthy customers participate in government programs to declare offshore assets.

“We would expect that after the outflows in the fourth quarter you will see a drop-off in recurring revenue as a consequence and also reduction in margin,” he said in a call with analysts on Friday.

Gardner added UBS expected to see a recovery by the second quarter of 2018.

The bank, which also has investment banking, asset management, and Swiss retail and corporate divisions, said political and monetary policy uncertainty made it cautious too.

Third-quarter group net profit came in at 946 million francs, lagging the average forecast in a Reuters survey of six analysts but ahead of the Swiss bank’s own poll.

UBS shares were down 1.1 percent at 1120 GMT, a steeper drop than the European banking sector index .SX7P.

‘EXPECTING A LOT’

Net new money inflows - a closely watched indicator of future earnings in money management - totaled 4.6 billion francs at UBS’s international wealth management unit in the third quarter.

A bright spot for the unit was the contribution from Asia Pacific, a priority growth region for UBS which has seen its best ever year-to-date performance.

UBS’s North America brokerage business, which handles just over half the bank’s wealth management assets, saw net outflows of $2.3 billion, a blow to a business investors hope is on an upward curve.

“The market is expecting a lot from wealth management Americas because of the good economy and the rate increases,” said Mirabaud Securities Limited analyst Andreas Brun, who rates UBS’s stock “buy”.

The investment bank, which UBS has scaled back in recent years to free up resources for wealth management, saw adjusted pretax operating profit rise 2.9 percent to 352 million francs.

UBS’s common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, an important measure of balance sheet strength which UBS uses to help decide its dividend, rose to 13.7 percent from 13.5 percent in the second quarter. A drop in the second quarter CET1 ratio had been a source of concern for some investors.

However, Brun said pending legal cases and the uncertainty over future capital rules under Basel IV regulations meant it was too soon to draw conclusions for the dividend.

“That ratio is clearly good for all those who want to make a dividend story out of UBS,” said Brun. “For me it’s still too early to call it a dividend story.”",UBS cautions gains from wealthy client activity may not last,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubs-group-ag-results/ubs-cautions-gains-from-wealthy-client-activity-may-not-last-idUSKBN1CW0QC

The decision left thousands of travelers stranded and cut rail access to cities such as Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Hanover and Kiel. The closures also affect popular routes such as from Frankfurt to Berlin and Dortmund to Hamburg.

Hamburg saw widespread flooding in the inner city area, including the area around the new Elbphilharmonie symphony hall.

The companies together generated more than $100 billion in revenue in the September quarter, roughly 2 percent of United States’ national output.

Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their price targets, with the most bullish pegging the companies’ stocks to rise between 21 percent and 47 percent in the next 12 months.

Google is “looking 20 years young,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, who bumped up his price target on the stock by 9 percent to $1,150.

Amazon’s (AMZN.O) shares rose as much as 9 percent to a three-month high of $1,063.77. Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet and Intel hit their highest in a decade.

“I expect markets to close the week on new record highs and a good portion of that should be attributed to the results that came from the tech companies,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.

Amazon, which is winning business from older, big-box rivals, pleased investors with its transparency around Whole Foods, the premium grocer it recently bought.

“The Street went into third quarter earnings concerned about lack of disclosure around Whole Foods, and Amazon surprised to the upside here by breaking out Whole Foods contribution,” analysts at JP Morgan said.

Amazon’s shares, have risen 30 percent this year through Thursday’s close, as its AWS cloud business has stayed ahead of the competition.

Alphabet’s Google, a relatively smaller player in the cloud business, doesn’t break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but analysts estimate the business is growing very fast, complementing the company’s core advertising business.

The company’s stock is also relatively cheap, trading at 25.8 times forward 12-month earnings, despite its 30 percent run this year, excluding gains on Friday.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Friday ordered a 24-hour suspension of military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq. The two sides held a first round of talks on Friday and Saturday .

Abadi said the talks are meant to prepare for the peaceful deployment of Iraqi troops at the border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria in Iraq’s Kurdistan region.

Clashes broke out between the two sides after Iraqi forces captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk from the Peshmerga, in a surprise offensive ordered by Abadi after the Kurds held an independence referendum in northern Iraq on Sept. 25.

Kirkuk is part of so-called disputed areas, claimed by both the Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq.

“The second round of talks about deploying federal troops in the disputed areas has started,” State TV said, giving no further details.

Abadi wants to take control of the disputed areas and the border crossings, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.

The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution” - a call rejected by Baghdad.

U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country.

The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG’s official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16. But the Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region.

The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by KRG President Masoud Barzani, since it halved the region’s oil export revenue.

The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur and south of their capital, Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides.

Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he was “disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution” and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG “overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution”.

Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,” he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.","Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga start new round of talks, Iraqi State TV says",https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-talks/iraqi-forces-kurdish-peshmerga-start-new-round-of-talks-iraqi-state-tv-says-idINKBN1CY0GJ?il=0

“Natürlich würden wir gerne Verantwortung übernehmen. Das ist doch völlig klar: Ministerien, Gesetze machen, mit Milliarden in die Bildung reingehen und große Probleme lösen”, sagte FDP-Chef Christian Lindner. Schon am nächsten Morgen begannen CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne allerdings mit der taktischen Positionierung für die nächste Sondierung - und sparten nicht mit gegenseitiger Kritik. Das wirft die Frage auf, ob das Quartett auf dem Weg nach Jamaika bereits vom Ziel abgekommen ist. Mit “50 zu 50” bezifferte etwa die FDP-Politikerin Katja Suding am Freitag die Chancen auf ein Bündnis.

Der Theaterdonner sollte nicht verdecken, dass die Verhandlungspartner tatsächlich bereits einen erheblichen Teil des Weges zurückgelegt haben: Nach der Wahl folgte zunächst eine Abkühl-Phase von drei Wochen. Trotz der Verzögerung galt dies als wichtige psychologische Pause, in der die vier Parteien das nach dem frühen Rückzug der SPD scheinbar Unvermeidliche akzeptieren lernten. Es schloss sich eine Woche des Schnupperns am Ex-Gegner mit Vor-Sondierungen an, in der etwa CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer einen fast schon historischen Besuch in der Grünen-Parteizentrale absolvierte. Nun liegen die ersten echten Runden mit harten Themen wie Finanzen, Klima oder Migration hinter den Verhandlern und es gibt - kaum überraschend - erste Probleme.

ERSTE LERNERFAHRUNG EINES UNGLEICHEN QUARTETTS

Natürlich betonen sowohl Lindner als auch Grünen-Politiker wie Robert Habeck oder CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer, dass die Koalition noch lange nicht in trockenen Tüchern ist. CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt warnte die Grünen nach Teilnehmerangaben in den Gesprächen am Donnerstag gar, dass ohne eine Begrenzung der Zuwanderung keine Regierung zustande kommen werde. Aber die ersten Gespräche waren auch ein Testfall, wie so unterschiedliche Parteien miteinander zurecht kommen können. “Und die Bilanz ist entgegen dem öffentlichen kritischen Trommeln besser als gedacht”, heißt es in der CDU.

Das liegt zum einen daran, dass eigentlich Undenkbares für viele CSU- und FDP-Politiker wie direkte Verhandlungen mit dem linken Grünen Jürgen Trittin längst eingetreten ist. Bei den Themen Finanzen und Europa liegen zudem die ersten Papiere vor, die die weiteren Debatten strukturieren und Vorentscheidungen festlegen. Dass es bisher noch keine Ergebnisse über Klima und Flüchtlinge gibt, ist wenig überraschend. Denn diese beiden Themen berühren die Markenkerne von Grünen und CSU. Die FDP wiederum will auf beiden Feldern deutlich machen, dass es “Trendwenden” zur bisherigen Politik der großen Koalition gibt.

Folglich wurden im grünen Verhandlungsteam die am Donnerstag aufgetretenen Schwierigkeiten nicht als Bruchstellen der Sondierungen gewertet. Mit den Vorwürfen vor allem an die Adresse der FDP, bei den vereinbarten Klima-Zielen einen Rückzieher gemacht zu haben, sollte vor allem den Partei-Linken signalisiert werden, man lasse sich nicht über den Tisch ziehen. Denn im linken Flügel, der vor der Wahl ein rot-rot-grünes Bündnis favorisiert hatte, ist das Misstrauen gegen eine Jamaika-Koalition viel stärker als bei den Realos, die schwarz-grünen Bündnissen gegenüber aufgeschlossen sind.

WO STECKEN DIE TORPEDOS?

In der CDU will man von Alarmismus ohnehin nichts wissen. Denn es sei ja bewusst entschieden worden, die Sondierung mit den schwersten Brocken zu beginnen - quasi als Testlauf, ob Gespräche überhaupt sinnvoll seien. Alle Dissonanzen dieser Woche werden deshalb als Anfängerfehler einer ungewöhnlichen Parteienkonstellation gewertet: Dabei zeigte sich auch, von wem die Jamaika-Gespräche noch torpediert werden könnten. So stellte Trittin das Erreichen der “Schwarzen Null” im Etat kurz nach der Veröffentlichung des gemeinsamen Papiers wieder infrage. Die FDP revanchierte sich mit der Interpretation, dass der im Papier erwähnte “Abbau” des Soli als “Abschaffung” verstanden werden müsse - was wiederum die drei anderen Partner provozierte.

Von allen Seiten wird eingeräumt, dass in den Gesprächen die Kluft zwischen den vier Parteien tatsächlich groß gewesen sei. Aber es sei eben auch klar geworden, dass eine Einigung nicht unmöglich sei. In einer einstündigen Aussprache versicherten sich die Verhandlungsführer am Donnerstag deshalb erst einmal gegenseitig guten Willen und gelobten Besserung. Am Wochenende sollen alle in Ruhe nachdenken, wie sie “konstruktiver” in die nächsten Sondierungsrunden kommende Woche ziehen.

Mark Garnier, a junior international trade minister, asked secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy two sex toys and he also called her “sugar tits”, the Mail on Sunday reported.

Garnier told the newspaper that the comment was part of an amusing conversation about a television show, and that asking her to buy the toys was “good humored high jinks”.

Edmondson, in comments to the paper, disputed Garnier’s recollection of the incidents, including his assertion that they were “high jinks”.

Garnier was not immediately available for comment to Reuters through his constituency or parliamentary offices.

The report comes after May’s spokeswoman said on Friday any unwanted sexual behavior was “completely unacceptable” and any minister who acted inappropriately would face “serious action”.

She was reacting to a report in another British newspaper that described a culture of sexual harassment among lawmakers and their staff working in parliament.

Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said on Sunday May had asked officials to investigate if Garnier, whose role is outside the cabinet immediately surrounding the May, had broken the government ministers’ code of behavior.

“These stories, if they are true, are obviously totally unacceptable,” Hunt told BBC television.

“The Cabinet Office will be conducting an investigation as to whether there has been a breach of the ministerial code in this particular case, but as you know the facts are disputed.”

May will also write to John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, to ask for his advice about changing the culture there, Hunt said.

Reports of inappropriate behavior in British politics, and in other industries, have followed dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove apologized on Saturday after he likened being interviewed by a BBC radio presenter to entering Weinstein’s bedroom. After the analogy was widely criticized, Gove apologized for what he said was a “clumsy attempt at humor”.

The Sun newspaper said on Friday that women working in politics in Westminster had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators.

A blockbuster deal with Airbus SE (AIR.PA) that saw the European company take control of the CSeries for $1 leaves Bombardier’s commercial aviation division with the soft-selling turboprop and regional jets lines.

Meanwhile, on the rail side, Bombardier recently lost out on a merger with Germany’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and now faces off against China’s merged rail company CRRC Corp (601766.SS) and a soon-to-be-formed European giant in Siemens-Alstom.

Macquarie on Friday said it would tweak 2019 company valuations to focus on corporate jets and rail, in the wake of the Airbus deal and media speculation on further commercial aircraft sales.

While the Airbus partnership boosts the CSeries and potentially Bombardier’s small aerostructures and engineering division, which produces aircraft components, the remaining lines in its commercial aerospace arm are “mature and stay stable at best as the industry changes around them,” according to AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray.

Removal of the CSeries headache means the company can focus on its more profitable rail and business jet divisions.

Yet even there, concerns remain with Moody’s this week downgrading Bombardier partly on “longer-term concerns” about the competitiveness of its rail business and concerns about its “future in the commercial aircraft space.” Bombardier said Moody’s action was “ill-founded.”

Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said recently the firm continues to weigh options for the rail unit. Asked about the future of the commercial aerospace unit on Oct. 20, he told reporters, “Right now the focus is to keep on selling these aircraft.”

“I think they will be forced to take a decision (to) either fix, coast or sell,” U.S. analyst Richard Aboulafia said of the commercial plane unit. “But fix means putting some serious money into product upgrades.”

Upgrading a regional jet with a new engine and wings would cost upwards of $1 billion, an amount likely to be prohibitive for the company as it spends on ramping up its CSeries and bringing its strong-selling Global 7000 to market, analysts say.

Bombardier has long weighed a sale or partnership venture to boost orders for its Q400 prop planes, which trail European rival ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo SpA (LDOF.MI). Such a deal, however, would be complicated by the need to ensure Canadian job security because the aircraft are assembled in Canada, government and union sources said.

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

SLIGHT UNIONIST LEAD

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Slideshow (4 Images)

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia-poll/hundreds-of-thousands-march-for-unified-spain-poll-shows-depths-of-division-idUKKBN1CY06S?il=0

The auto safety agency said in a report that it wants to find any “unnecessary regulatory barriers” to self-driving cars “particularly those that are not equipped with controls for a human driver.”

The agency also wants comments on what research it needs to conduct before deciding whether to eliminate or rewrite regulations. But it could take the agency years to complete the research and finalize rule changes, and advocates are pushing Congress to act.

NHTSA said in a statement it plans to issue a formal notice in the “near future requesting comment” on the hurdles. The agency hopes to make the notice public by the end of November.

Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. The agency said last year that current regulations pose “significant” regulatory hurdles to vehicles without human controls.

In early October, a U.S. Senate committee unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls and would allow the agency to waive requirements.

General Motors Co (GM.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes.

The Senate Commerce Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from NHTSA for safety rules for up to 80,000 vehicles annually within three years.

An Apple spokesman confirmed the acquisition, which was earlier reported in New Zealand media. Both companies declined to provide details of the purchase.

Wireless charging allows users to recharge devices by placing them on a pad or other surface rather than inserting them in a cradle or attaching a cable.

Apple has been slow to adopt the technology, lagging behind its biggest rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other mobile phone companies that have offered wireless charging in some of their devices for several years.

Apple joined the industry body that develops the Qi wireless charging standard, the Wireless Power Consortium, in February. The iPhone 8 and X both support the standard.

This could allow Apple to offer much larger pads that could quickly charge multiple consumer devices, including laptops and even electric scooters, he added.

For consumers, charging a single device on one pad may not be that appealing, “but when you get into multiple device charging it starts to get attractive”, Saunders said.

The announcement came a day after a federal judge had given an unnamed bank more time to respond to the congressional panel’s subpoena to Fusion GPS, the research outfit that hired a former British spy to compile a dossier on presidential candidate Donald Trump.

The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative online publication backed by billionaire Republican mega-donor Paul Singer, said on Friday it was the original funder of the Fusion GPS project to compile opposition research on multiple Republican presidential candidates, including Trump.

Trump and other Republicans have alleged that Russians paid Fusion GPS for research on their own dealings with the president and his campaign.

But the Free Beacon said all the material it was provided came from public sources and that the effort was separate from a former British spy’s dossier of allegations of Russian financial and personal links to President Donald Trump’s campaign and associates.

Known as the Steele dossier because it was compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, the document identified Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the Russian government.

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee began paying Fusion GPS in April 2016 for research on Trump, an arrangement that later produced the Steele dossier.

Trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax, has repeatedly called the dossier fake news.

Much of the inflammatory and at times salacious content of the dossier has not been verified. However, U.S. officials have confirmed certain details.

In a closed-door hearing with Senate Judiciary Committee investigators, Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson said there was no connection between the firm’s work on the dossier and its legal research on a lawsuit involving Russians who attended a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law and close aide, Jared Kushner, and former campaign chief Paul Manafort, sources familiar with the hearing said.",U.S. House panel says agreement reached over Fusion GPS bank records,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-dossier/u-s-house-panel-says-agreement-reached-over-fusion-gps-bank-records-idUSKBN1CX0OL

Applauding Pruitt’s move, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the plan to stop power plants from dumping unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere ”a vast, unlawful expansion of government authority” into the energy sector that had been “especially devastating” to coal country.

The reality is different. Republicans say that deregulating carbon pollution will revive the coal industry, but it won’t. The decades-long decline in coal jobs reflects larger economic forces: mechanization, tapped-out coal veins in Appalachia, and stiffer competition from increasingly cheap energy production from solar panels, wind turbines, and natural gas. In the last decade, coal’s share of the U.S. energy portfolio declined from half to one-third. This predates the Clean Power Plan, which has not yet even taken effect.

The Trump administration may not even be able to repeal the Clean Power regulation. Liberal states and environmental groups already are lining up to challenge Pruitt’s plans in court. The federal government is legally obligated to limit carbon pollution and coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source. Unless Republicans change the law, they may be forced to uphold the plan. Anyway, the Democrats will reinstate the rule if they win back control of the White House.

Although Ryan called the Clean Power Plan a “signature climate rule” of the Obama administration, it was Republican President Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which requires EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger human health. In 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that clear evidence — some of it produced by the government’s own scientists — demonstrated that carbon emissions cause global warming, which in turn causes dangers such as smog, deadly heat waves, and hurricanes. Therefore, the court ruled that EPA had to regulate carbon.

George W. Bush stalled on implementation until the end of his administration, and Barack Obama spent his first few years in office trying to craft legislation in which the government would create a cap-and-trade program to regulate carbon. Because the Senate failed to pass cap-and-trade, the Obama administration eventually came up with the Clean Power Plan.

Even if Pruitt were able to convince courts that the Clean Power Plan’s costs outweigh its benefits – an argument for which environmentalists have plenty of counter-evidence – the EPA would still be obligated to come up with a replacement carbon pollution regulation. Courts could order EPA to produce a regulation by a certain time and hold Pruitt in contempt of court if he fails to comply. That’s what happened to EPA administrator William D. Ruckelshaus in 1984 for not issuing standards on radioactive airborne materials.

Although other regulatory rollbacks might trigger apoplexy among green organizations, in this case they say they are certain of victory. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, the largest U.S. environmental organization, while predicting that “Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt will go down in infamy for launching one of the most egregious attacks ever on public health,” also noted, “No matter who is in the White House, EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution.”

To be sure, Pruitt’s plan represents a threat to the environment. Coal is the dirtiest major source of energy in the United States. In addition to contributing to climate change, it produces a host of toxins such as nitrous oxide and mercury and is a major source of smog. When it drafted the Clean Power rule, the EPA estimated that it would prevent 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths per year by 2030. If the courts do let Pruitt repeal the rule, it could slow the transition away from coal, causing dirtier air and more global warming.

However, the only way to lastingly prevent carbon regulation would be to revise the Clean Air Act to stipulate that its standards do not apply to carbon. Republicans in Congress have tried to do just that. Their most recent bill, released in February, immediately attracted over 100 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans.

Preventing carbon regulation would be extremely unpopular. Polls show large majorities of the public, sometimes including a majority of Republican voters, support regulating climate pollution.

As David Doniger, director of the climate program at the left-leaning Natural Resources Defense Council and a former EPA official, told me in April for an article I wrote in The Washington Post: “After the Bush administration...the Clean Air Act was still in effect and the Obama administration started to set things right. It’s not a very satisfying thing to think of this as a 30-years war, but it’s longer than a four-year battle.”

Trump does have considerable political capital invested in the battle. In March, he issued an executive order directing Pruitt to get rid of the Clean Power rule. As a candidate, the president repeatedly promised to end his predecessor’s “war on coal” and put the miners back to work.

However, market realities will make this promise impossible to keep as coal’s slide continues. In 2016, natural gas passed coal as the leading source of American electricity, a shift the U.S. Energy Information Agency finds is “mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices.” There’s no sign of the fracking-driven cheap gas boom abating.

“The law says if you want to vote, you vote, if not, you don‘t.”","MUHORONI, Kenya (Reuters) - Kenya’s repeat presidential election, boycotted this week by millions, has reignited long-running tensions between ethnic communities in some areas, leading inhabitants of one small village in the west to pick up traditional arms on Saturday.

In the bright green sugarcane fields where the western Nyanza region rolls toward the Nandi hills, two tribes -- the Luo and the Kalenjin -- have lived in relative peace for years.

But in the village of Koguta, down the road from the town of Mugoroni in Kisumu County, Thursday’s polarizing vote reignited old grievances.

The stand-off, defused by an emergency intervention of three county governors, was a stark reminder of how easily Kenya’s months-long political crisis could spark the type of ethnic violence that killed 1,200 people after a flawed 2007 vote.

On one side of Koguta are Kalenjins, here ardent supporters of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Kalenjin deputy, William Ruto. But the Luos across the road support opposition leader Raila Odinga, who called for a boycott of the vote because he said it would not be fair.

Some of the Luos here fought police to stop ballot boxes being delivered. The Luo accused the Kalenjin of stealing cattle and burning their sugarcane crop in revenge, prompting both sides to grab machetes, spears, bows and arrows, and wooden clubs.

“This is an area where they tried to come in with ballot boxes, there was serious resistance, so that was the genesis of all this enmity between the Kalenjins and the Luos,” said Julius Genga, a county legislator, as a colleague stood atop a sports utility vehicle to calm a crowd of men with spears.

The opposition dismissed the vote as a “sham” although Kenyatta’s supporters say it was legitimate. Protests stopped four counties from opening polling stations at all. Only a third of voters turned up, and the opposition is likely to challenge the poll in court.

“This has to do with politics,” said Collins Owuor, 21, holding a machete. “Before politics we did not have problems with these people.”

In the distance, where smoke rose from sugarcane fields, Reuters saw police speaking to spear-wielding Kalenjins, but the local police chief warned journalists away.

By the end of the afternoon’s meetings, the cattle had been returned and officials said they hoped the risk of violence had been quelled.

ELECTORAL SAGA

Koguta is not the only place where simmering ethnic tensions have broken into the open.

On Friday night in the Nairobi slum of Kawangware, a man was beaten to death and homes and shop burned down amid rumors that a TRIBAL militia had infiltrated the neighborhood of a different tribe.

In Thursday’s vote, Kenyatta only faced six minor candidates, none of whom won more than 1 percent in August, and that and the low turnout have quashed his hopes of securing a decisive mandate to lead east Africa’s richest economy.

Deputy president William Ruto, Kenyatta’s running mate, told CNN on Saturday he expected the final tally from the vote to be ready by Sunday:

“Shortly we will be having a declaration and finally a swearing in, in accordance with the constitution.”

The election board said on Saturday it would soon announce a new plan for the nearly 30 of 290 constituencies that have not voted yet. The constitution says the vote must be held in every constituency.

More legal cases against the election are expected next week.

If the courts fail to find a path out of the crisis, including a possible order for another rerun, the protracted and economically damaging stalemate between the Kenyatta and Odinga camps is likely to continue.

The electoral saga is polarizing the nation and slowing growth in what has been one of Africa’s most vibrant economies, which is also a regional trade hub and a security ally for Western nations.

In Odinga strongholds, residents accused authorities of trying to “force” voter participation.

“This is pure oppression,” said Hassan Hussein, a Muslim community leader. “The law says if you want to vote, you vote, if not, you don‘t.”","In Kenya, polarizing election re-run rekindles ethnic tensions",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-election/in-kenya-polarizing-election-re-run-rekindles-ethnic-tensions-idUSKBN1CX07N?il=0

Clashes in Kawangware and in a village in western Kenya following Thursday’s vote were the first signs that face-offs between Odinga supporters and the police might eventually morph into neighbors turning against each other.

“A country cannot be ruled by the gun. Standing here in this church we want to condemn the militarization of politics in this country,” Odinga told residents in the Nairobi slum.

The veteran opposition leader had boycotted the re-run of an August presidential election that was nullified by Kenya’s Supreme Court on procedural grounds, leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta with an almost free run against six minor candidates.

On Friday, a day after the repeat vote was held in most of the country, ethnic violence in Kawangware saw dozens of homes and shops torched and one man killed. Most of buildings torched belonged to residents from the Kenyatta’s Kikuyu tribe.

One man from Odinga’s Luo group was killed overnight near Koguta village in the west of the country, after residents from two ethnic groups backing different candidates armed themselves.

If such isolated incidents become a trend, it could ignite large swathes of Kenya, as happened after a 2007 presidential election when weeks of violence left 1,200 dead. That sent ripples throughout East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and diplomatic hub.

In his speech, Odinga condemned violence generally and did not single out any particular attack.

“We have come here to give consolation to those who were beaten and killed. We as NASA condemn what happened,” he told worshippers at a church in Kawangware, referring to his National Super Alliance, an opposition coalition.

Odinga boycotted Thursday’s vote because he said the contest would not be fair. Instead, he wanted the Oct. 26 contest dismissed and fresh elections held within 90 days.

His withdrawal means Kenyans are watching the turnout, rather than the result, for an indication of Kenyatta’s popularity for a second, five-year term.

Results published on Sunday by the election commission showed that Kenyatta had won slightly more than 98 percent of the vote with results in from 244 out of 291 constituencies.

Turnout for the constituencies counted so far was 43 percent. That figure is likely to decrease when it includes returns of 0 from least 23 constituencies where authorities were unable to open even a single polling station because of protests by Odinga’s supporters.

With margins squeezed by a stagnant domestic market and rivalry from China and South Korea, many factories have cut costs, reducing their reliance on workers in lifetime employment in favour of labourers on temporary contracts.

As they have done so, safety scandals have erupted across the country’s much-vaunted manufacturing sector, with Subaru Corp (7270.T) on Friday joining Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) in admitting it failed to follow proper vehicle inspection procedures.

Earlier this month, Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T), said its workers had tampered with product specifications for years, leaving companies around the world scrambling to verify the safety of cars, planes, trains and electrical goods.

Unable to easily lay off “regular” employees, full-time employees with permanent contracts and pay scales based on seniority that formed the heart of Japan’s post-war workforce, companies have increasingly come to rely on “non-regular” workers - temps, part-timers and short-term contract workers.

These non-regular workers allow companies to cut costs and adjust their workforce, said Koji Morioka, emeritus professor at Kansai University and an expert on workplace issues. But it has led to a de-skilling of the factory floor, lowering standards and increasing the likelihood of wrongdoing and accidents, he said.

“The use of these ‘disposable’ workers is greatly increasing,” Morioka said. “The loss of experienced, skilled workers on the factory floor is becoming more and more risky.”

The share of non-regular workers in the labour force has risen from 20 percent in the early 1990s to a record 37.5 percent last year - with the proportion in some companies higher still.

The pay gap is stark, with regular workers last year on average paid 321,700 yen (£2,095) monthly compared with 211,800 yen for contract workers.

Companies are failing to produce the skilled workers needed to ensure standards are met in areas like safety at a time when scrutiny is intensifying around the world and lapses are met with greater criticism, said Parissa Haghirian, professor of Japanese management at Sophia University in Tokyo.

“There is a real human resource problem,” she said, with the traditional model of hiring workers straight out of school or university, teaching them on the job and rotating them between departments no longer functioning well.

AFTERTHOUGHT

With the ratio of companies complaining of labour shortages at a 25-year high and with firms needing specialists but failing to produce them internally, competition for skilled workers is likely to become more fierce, Haghirian said.

“I predict high performers will leave more quickly... leaving companies in trouble because these people traditionally would stay and drag everyone else along,” she said.

Japanese companies are not alone in being caught up in scandals, with European and U.S. companies caught cutting corners and manipulating results in areas like vehicle emissions tests to the sale of meat. But the Japanese firms face questions over whether they can adapt quickly enough.

Some Japanese makers have taken the attitude that “because the factory floor is well run, quality control and inspection can be applied as an afterthought,” said Tadashi Kunihiro, a lawyer who is a director and auditor on company boards.

Kobe Steel President and CEO Hiroya Kawasaki speaks at a news conference in Tokyo, Japan, October 26, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai

Companies, he said, were not placing their most skilled workers in quality control roles.

While safety lapses have been going on at some companies for years or even decades, the decline of the lifetime employment system has likely sapped the loyalty of workers who are more likely to raise concerns themselves, Kunihiro added.

Improving transparency at companies has been a key plank of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s corporate governance reforms through measures such as boosting the number of outside directors.

But experts question whether such reforms can do much to prevent safety scandals occurring in the first place.

The 27-year-old former world number one entered the contest having lost to the evergreen Williams seven times in as many matches but the resilient Dane served and retrieved brilliantly and emerged with a deserved victory after 89 minutes.

Wozniacki was faultless for an hour as she raced to a one-set and 5-0 lead but Williams always plays to win and the 37-year-old American reeled off four games in a row before the Dane could finally lift the title at the elite, eight-woman event in her fifth appearance.

“It was all going well at 5-0 in the second set, then she went for her shots and I was just so happy to get it done in the end,” Wozniacki, who will rise three places to third in the world rankings after the win, said in a courtside interview.

“Well eight is my lucky number and I figured if I was ever going to beat her it would be today... and I just went out there and did my best.”

The first three games were dominated by the server until the Dane started to find the corners with her powerful backhand and fashioned the first break of the match with back-to-back winners off both flanks.

Williams was trying to get to the net at every opportunity and came forward to good effect after dropping her serve. A vicious cross-court backhand enabled the American to break back immediately on her way to leveling the score at 3-3.

She continued to be the aggressor but the Dane held on in the face of some brutal hitting for her opponent and somehow forged her second break of the set with some exquisite deep hitting to move within one game of taking the opener.

The American came roaring back once more, leaving the Dane looking on as a helpless spectator, with a barrage of winners to get the high-class contest back on serve.

After working so hard to stay in touch, Williams would have been deeply frustrated to gift her opponent the set when the Dane did not have to work to seize the third break in a row, the wayward American sending forehands wide, long and into the net.

Wozniacki had seized the momentum with her variation, depth of shot and complete lack of errors preventing Williams from grabbing any sort of foothold in the contest and the flying Dane raced into a 5-0 lead in 11 second-set minutes.

Needing to hold serve just to stay in the contest, Williams found her rhythm to belatedly get on the scoreboard in the second set and then secured her first break of the second with some solid play against an increasingly anxious Wozniacki.

Williams suddenly appeared relaxed and free, holding easily to heap more pressure on the Dane before stretching every muscle and sinew in an impressive ninth game to break once more and get it back to 5-4.

The crowd wanted more but Wozniacki was not prepared to give them what they wanted, breaking again and sealing victory on her second match point with a backhand winner down the line, and tossing her racket in the air as she celebrated a stunning triumph.

The approximately 2-foot (0.61-meter) robots come with a tower that is fitted with cameras that scan aisles to check stock and identify missing and misplaced items, incorrect prices and mislabeling. The robots pass that data to store employees, who then stock the shelves and fix errors.

Out-of-stock items are a big problem for retailers since they miss out on sales every time a shopper cannot find a product on store shelves.

Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer has been testing shelf-scanning robots in a handful of stores in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and California.

“If you are running up and down the aisle and you want to decide if we are out of Cheerios or not, a human doesn’t do that job very well, and they don’t like it,” Jeremy King, chief technology officer for Walmart U.S. and e-commerce, told Reuters.

The company said the robots would not replace workers or affect employee headcount in stores.

The robots are 50 percent more productive than their human counterparts and can scan shelves significantly more accurately and three times faster, King said. Store employees only have time to scan shelves about twice a week.

The idea of installing robots to automate retail is not new. Rival Amazon.com Inc uses small Kiva robots in its warehouses to handle picking and packing, saving almost 20 percent in operating expenses.

In the past year, it has installed giant “pickup towers” that operate like self-service kiosks and where customers can pick up their online orders.

The company has also speeded up the checkout process by allowing customers to scan their own purchases, and it has digitized operations like pharmacy and financial services in stores.

Oficiais dos EUA disseram que serão construtivos na reunião anual com 195 países em Bonn, Alemanha, entre 6 e 17 de novembro, para trabalhar em um “livro de regras” para o plano do Acordo de Paris de 2015, de reduzir o uso de combustíveis fósseis na economia mundial, neste século.

Mas outras nações estão divididas entre receber ou repreender os enviados de Washington, depois da decisão de Trump, em junho, de retirar os Estados Unidos do acordo e promover a indústria americana de combustíveis fósseis.

Washington mantém seu lugar nas conversas porque o pacto de Paris estipula que nenhum país pode formalmente sair do acordo antes de novembro de 2020.

“O regime Trump precisa se afastar e não fazer o resto do mundo de refém da inépcia do presidente”, disse Ian Fry, que representa Tuvalu, uma pequena nação no Pacífico, sob o risco de tempestades e inundações.

Ele disse à Reuters que as políticas pró-carvão de Trump e os questionamentos se as mudanças climáticas são causadas pela emissão de gases de efeito estufa podem prejudicar a emergência da reunião entre representantes oficiais e ministros do Meio-Ambiente.

A Casa Branca não respondeu aos pedidos por comentários, e o Departamento de Estado não programou uma entrevista coletiva antes da reunião, como faz tradicionalmente.

The victims in Poland and the Czech Republic were killed by falling trees. The storm also knocked out power to thousands of Czechs and Poles.

Winds reached more than 100 kph in several parts of the Czech Republic and topped out at 180 kph on Snezka, at 1,602 meters the country’s highest mountain, Czech Television reported.

Bild newspaper reported that a 63-year-old German man drowned at a campsite in Lower Saxony as a result of a storm surge.

In Germany, railway operator Deutsche Bahn [DBN.UL] cited what it called “significant damage” on main routes, and said rail traffic on many routes in northern and central Germany would remain suspended until Monday.

The decision left thousands of travelers stranded and cut rail access to cities such as Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Hanover and Kiel. The closures also affect popular routes such as from Frankfurt to Berlin and Dortmund to Hamburg.

Hamburg saw widespread flooding in the inner city area, including the area around the new Elbphilharmonie symphony hall.

The adults and teenagers of “Stranger Things 2” wrestle emotionally with the events of the first season: a town boy’s disappearance, a death, a mysterious girl with superpowers and a decaying parallel universe called the Upside Down.

“We wanted that trauma to really run through the entire season so it’s about these characters confronting the horrors,” said Matt Duffer, one half of the Duffer Brothers, the twins who created the show.

All nine episodes of “Stranger Things 2” will be released on Friday.

At the center of the show are its young teenage breakout stars. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) suffers worsening visions of the Upside Down after being rescued, forcing his friends to try to find a way to defeat the demon known as Demogorgon.

Eleven, the innocent, tormented young girl with superpowers played by Emmy-nominated 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is believed dead and is in hiding, staying with the town’s police chief, Jim Hopper. Frustrated at being kept away from her friends, Eleven clashes with Hopper (David Harbour) and embarks on a mission to find her mother and finally find a home.

“We wanted (Eleven) to go through her own journey in a way that was much more personal to her and wasn’t tied to the boys,” Matt Duffer said. “We wanted her to go through a journey of self-discovery without the help of anyone else.”

“Stranger Things” has become a phenomenon for Netflix Inc, landing Emmy wins and drawing a cadre of obsessed fans who launched a viral online campaign, #JusticeForBarb, sparked by the gruesome demise of supporting character Barb Holland.

The second season ramps up the quest to bring closure to her death while introducing new characters and expanding the story geographically.

The Duffers said they anticipate five seasons to bring “Stranger Things” to a conclusion.

“It was important to us this season to start to move out of Hawkins and to introduce this world,” said Ross Duffer.

FILE PHOTO - A pump jack used to help lift crude oil from a well in South Texas’ Eagle Ford Shale formation stands idle in Dewitt County, Texas, U.S. on January 13, 2016. REUTERS/Anna Driver/File Photo

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

The “Greater Jerusalem” legislation would put some settlements in the occupied West Bank, built on land Palestinians seek for a future state and viewed as illegal by most countries, under the jurisdiction of Jerusalem’s municipality.

The bill, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, was to have been submitted for approval on Sunday to a ministerial committee on legislation, a first step before a series of ratification votes in parliament.

But Likud lawmaker David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu’s coalition in parliament, said a vote by the cabinet committee would be delayed because Washington told Israel the bill’s passage could impede U.S. efforts to revive peace talks that collapsed in 2014.

“There is American pressure that claims this is about annexation and that this could interfere with the peace process,” Bitan told Army Radio.

“The prime minister doesn’t think this is about annexation. I don’t think so either. We have to take the time to clarify matters to the Americans. Therefore, if the bill passes in a week, or in a month, it’s less problematic,” he said.

Proponents of the legislation say it falls short of formal land annexation to Israel but will enable some 150,000 settlers to vote in Jerusalem city elections. Intelligence Minister Israel Katz, a supporter of the bill, has said this would “ensure a Jewish majority in a united Jerusalem”.

Israel’s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector it captured along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a 1967 Middle East war, has not won international recognition. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Israeli media reports said the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, had conveyed misgivings about the legislation, under which the large Maale Adumim and Beitar Illit settlements would become part of a Greater Jerusalem municipality.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as telling cabinet ministers on Sunday: “The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was all about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth continuing to talk and coordinate with them.”

A U.S. embassy spokeswoman declined immediate comment.

King Bhumibol, the world’s longest reigning monarch when he died last year at the age of 88, ruled Thailand from shortly after World War Two and was revered as a stabilizing figure through coups, protests and natural disasters.

Over 19 million Thais - more than a quarter of the 69 million population - participated in ceremonies by presenting symbolic sandalwood flowers to be burned at temples and crematorium replicas across the country, according to the government.

On Sunday, the late king’s bones were moved to the Chakri Throne Hall, where royal relics are kept within the Grand Palace in a ceremony that involved senior monks from temples across the country. His son, new King Maha Vajiralongkorn, led the religious rite.

On Sunday evening, Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana led the final royal procession on horseback to the Wat Rajabopidh and Wat Bovoranives temples where her grandfather’s ashes were placed in keeping with a ceremony steeped in religious symbolism and tradition. Mourners, some in tears, were gathered outside the temples.

“I will always have him stored in my heart. Whether as pictures, however old and torn, the memory of him will always be kept in my heart,” said Chalermporm Prabutr, 72.

“A potential combination would diversify CVS profit streams ahead of an Amazon entry and set the stage for a new healthcare-retail delivery model,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is planning to move into online prescription drug sales, multiple media reports have said, potentially posing an existential threat to brick-and-mortar pharmacies.

That possibility has hit shares of most drugstore operators on fears that the online retailer would leverage its vast ecommerce platform in prescription drug sales.

“We believe CVS does need to respond to the potential threat and strike a different path,” Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a note.

A deal would make CVS-Aetna a one-stop shop for customers’ health care needs - ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores.

The vertical integration of retail pharmacy, PBM, and insurers fits with broader healthcare themes of expanded access, consumerism and cost reduction, Jefferies analysts said, adding that the deal chatter was not a complete surprise.

“It would address each company’s need for a fresh script.”

The deal between companies in two very concentrated industries will likely prompt concern about their rivals having an access to market, or foreclosure, two antitrust expert said.

But the deal will likely win approval from antitrust enforcers because the two companies are in different businesses along the same supply chain, or a vertical merger, other experts said.

“I don’t doubt that there will be a lot of people that will be concerned about such a huge deal,” said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard. “But articulating an antitrust theory (to stop it) is difficult.”

The two companies overlap in at least one area - providing Medicare Part D pharmacy prescription drug coverage. Analysts at Evercore ISI estimated that 23 percent of Aetna’s Part D clients were in counties where there may be antitrust concerns but these could likely be remedied through asset sales.

Some analysts said the deal could also trigger a wave of consolidation across the industry.

It could be a possible catalyst for higher health insurance sector valuation, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Bosch said, adding that WellCare Health Plans (WCG.N), Humana (HUM.N) and Centene (CNC.N) could be possible acquisition targets.

Aetna earlier this year scrapped plans to merge with rival Humana after antitrust enforcers said that the combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) were anti-competitive.",CVS deal for Aetna could help retailer face Amazon entry: analysts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health-research/cvs-deal-for-aetna-could-help-retailer-face-amazon-entry-analysts-idUSKBN1CW1YC

At Kinfe Abera's (not pictured) garage in Addis Ababa, cranky, 50-year-old Volkswagen Beetles enjoy a kind of life after death; their parts are never discarded but re-used to keep the city's remaining Beetles on the road.

The Beetle was born in the 1930s out of dictator Adolf Hitler's desire to produce a cheap ""people's car"" for the German family. After World War Two it sold in the tens of millions around the globe and in the 1960s even starred in a Disney movie as Herbie the ""Love Bug"".

Production of the original version of the curvy little vehicles ended in 2003, and authentic spare parts can be hard to come by. So Ethiopian mechanics have to ""slaughter"" some cars to keep others alive. ""If one is in a bad condition, we will cannibalise it and give its parts to other cars. That is how we extend their life,"" said Kinfe, the 74-year-old garage-owner who has been working on Beetles for six decades.

""The Volkswagen Beetle is a servant car for lower income people. They never fail you - they take you anywhere and have excellent functionality,"" he said.

About 8,000 commercial and other vehicles are assembled in Ethiopia for the home market, about a quarter of them cars. The numbers of expensive imported models on the roads is also rising as a new middle class emerges.

With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement’s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament.

Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one.

The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom.

Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust.

The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s use of offshore tax havens.

In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world’s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability.

After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties.

The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament’s 63 seats.

“The opposition has a majority, so that’s a message. But we’ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,” Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday.

The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.

The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament.

The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year’s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland’s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters.

Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said: ”I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it’s normal that we should be a part of a future government.

“We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,” he said. “We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.”

His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.

The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year’s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.

“I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,” said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government.

The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes.

The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history.

The Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for this weekend’s attack. The government responded by sacking two of the country’s top security officials.

“So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,” Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters.

At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. And a woman, Madobe Nunow, was beheaded while her “three children were shot dead,” he said.

A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel.

Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said.

The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel’s defenses. Then gunmen stormed the building.

The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.

The government sacked the country’s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, a statement from the prime minister’s office said.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.

”After the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces.

Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. The government and al Shabaab typically give different figures for victims in such attacks.

The twin bombings in Mogadishu on Oct. 14 killed at least 358 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history, igniting nationwide outrage. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but the method - a large truck bomb - is one it has often used.

The German international repeatedly came to Barca’s rescue in a typically gruelling game at the atmospheric San Mames stadium as 17 shots flew at his goal over the course of the game, and he thwarted Athletic’s top scorer Aritz Aduriz on four separate occasions.

The Liga leaders were only able to withstand an early onslaught from the Basques thanks to Ter Stegen, who flew to his right to repel an Aduriz header in the 17th minute. Moments later he denied the veteran striker from point blank range after the visiting defence had been caught out by a chipped pass.

Lionel Messi eventually gave Barca the lead nine minutes before halftime but Athletic continued to rain shots down on Ter Stegen’s area after the break.

The goalkeeper made his most impressive intervention with six minutes remaining, stooping low to his near post to claw away a close range header from Aduriz.

Brazilian midfielder Paulinho put an extra shine on a closely fought victory for Barca by tapping in the second goal in injury time.

“A huge part of this win belongs to him, he’s playing at a great level and was vital in making sure we won the game,” said Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets in praise of Ter Stegen.

“We’re happy to have him with us and once again he was decisive in those big moments, at 0-0 and then 1-0 in the final minutes, which would have led to a draw.”

Ter Stegen arrived at Barca from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2014 as the long term replacement for Victor Valdes but had to battle with Chilean Claudio Bravo for two seasons before becoming the club’s undisputed number one custodian.

He had teething problems and was ridiculed at times for his wild rushes from his area which have cost Barca in the past. One of his worst performances came at San Mames when his current coach Ernesto Valverde was in charge of Athletic, who thrashed the Catalans 4-0 in the Spanish Super Cup in 2015.

“IN SAFE HANDS”

He has been one of Barca’s most decisive players this season, however, also coming to his side’s rescue in closely fought games against Getafe and Atletico Madrid and helping his side take a joint-record 28 points from their first 10 games.

The German was on Sunday hailed as “Super Ter Stegen” on the cover of Spanish newspaper Sport, while daily Mundo Deportivo declared Barca were “in safe hands” thanks to him.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Friday ordered a 24-hour suspension of military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq. The two sides held a first round of talks on Friday and Saturday .

Abadi said the talks are meant to prepare for the peaceful deployment of Iraqi troops at the border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria in Iraq’s Kurdistan region.

Clashes broke out between the two sides after Iraqi forces captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk from the Peshmerga, in a surprise offensive ordered by Abadi after the Kurds held an independence referendum in northern Iraq on Sept. 25.

Kirkuk is part of so-called disputed areas, claimed by both the Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq.

“The second round of talks about deploying federal troops in the disputed areas has started,” State TV said, giving no further details.

Abadi wants to take control of the disputed areas and the border crossings, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.

The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution” - a call rejected by Baghdad.

U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country.

The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG’s official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16. But the Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region.

The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by KRG President Masoud Barzani, since it halved the region’s oil export revenue.

The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur and south of their capital, Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides.

Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he was “disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution” and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG “overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution”.

Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,” he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.","Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga start new round of talks, Iraqi State TV says",https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-talks/iraqi-forces-kurdish-peshmerga-start-new-round-of-talks-iraqi-state-tv-says-idINKBN1CY0GJ

Clashes in Kawangware and in a village in western Kenya following Thursday’s vote were the first signs that face-offs between Odinga supporters and the police might eventually morph into neighbors turning against each other.

“A country cannot be ruled by the gun. Standing here in this church we want to condemn the militarization of politics in this country,” Odinga told residents in the Nairobi slum.

The veteran opposition leader had boycotted the re-run of an August presidential election that was nullified by Kenya’s Supreme Court on procedural grounds, leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta with an almost free run against six minor candidates.

On Friday, a day after the repeat vote was held in most of the country, ethnic violence in Kawangware saw dozens of homes and shops torched and one man killed. Most of buildings torched belonged to residents from the Kenyatta’s Kikuyu tribe.

One man from Odinga’s Luo group was killed overnight near Koguta village in the west of the country, after residents from two ethnic groups backing different candidates armed themselves.

If such isolated incidents become a trend, it could ignite large swathes of Kenya, as happened after a 2007 presidential election when weeks of violence left 1,200 dead. That sent ripples throughout East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and diplomatic hub.

In his speech, Odinga condemned violence generally and did not single out any particular attack.

“We have come here to give consolation to those who were beaten and killed. We as NASA condemn what happened,” he told worshippers at a church in Kawangware, referring to his National Super Alliance, an opposition coalition.

Odinga boycotted Thursday’s vote because he said the contest would not be fair. Instead, he wanted the Oct. 26 contest dismissed and fresh elections held within 90 days.

His withdrawal means Kenyans are watching the turnout, rather than the result, for an indication of Kenyatta’s popularity for a second, five-year term.

Results published on Sunday by the election commission showed that Kenyatta had won slightly more than 98 percent of the vote with results in from 244 out of 291 constituencies.

Turnout for the constituencies counted so far was 43 percent. That figure is likely to decrease when it includes returns of 0 from least 23 constituencies where authorities were unable to open even a single polling station because of protests by Odinga’s supporters.

Segundo os médicos que acompanham o presidente no Hospital Sírio-Libanês, o ideal é que ele fique em São Paulo repousando, em sua casa.

Dessa forma, ele voltaria para Brasília apenas na terça ou quarta-feira, segundo a assessoria do Planalto.

Temer já deixou a unidade de terapia semi-intensiva e se recupera no quarto da intervenção cirúrgica. Ele passa bem, segundo os médicos.

De acordo com o urologista Miguel Srougi, o resultado de uma biópsia mostrou um processo de crescimento benigno na próstata, e a cirurgia transcorreu “sem intercorrências”.

Temer foi internado no Sírio-Libanês no início da noite de sexta-feira com quadro de retenção urinária por hiperplasia benigna da próstata.

O problema foi descoberto na quarta-feira, dia da votação da segunda denúncia contra ele na Câmara dos Deputados, quando o presidente foi internado no Hospital do Exército após sentir-se mal e foi constatada a obstrução urológica.

The drugstore and pharmacy-benefit company should be able to generate some cost savings if its $66 billion offer for the health insurer prevails. Even more important, it could help the firm resist Amazon’s entry into drug distribution, and the unpleasant side effects of transparency and low margins that may follow.

Getting drugs from producers to consumers is a complex and foggy business, with multiple middlemen capturing bits and pieces along the way. Combining CVS and Aetna would create a single business able to negotiate a lower price from a drugmaker, dispense the medicine, and insure customers so they can pay for it.

That could mean savings from fewer administrative staff and combined IT systems. The nation’s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, runs a prescription drug benefit business in-house that has done well. There may be a cost though. Rival insurer Anthem recently partnered with CVS to form a drug-benefit business due to start in 2020. Whether Anthem would want to play ball with Aetna in the picture is a big question.

Yet it’s notable that this overture became public the same day that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch confirmed Amazon had received approval from multiple states to become a wholesale pharmaceutical distributer. Rumor and logic suggest strongly that the retailer will ultimately offer prescriptions online.

That news caused widespread damage to drug middlemen stocks earlier in the day. CVS, for example, saw its shares initially fall up to 6 percent on the news. Currently pharmacy-benefit managers can negotiate discounts with drugmakers in the dark, push customers toward captive pharmacies and extract a profit. It’s one of the reasons why healthcare is so much more costly and complex in America than in most developed countries. Amazon on the other hand, is notorious for disrupting businesses, focusing on customers, and being willing to accept nearly non-existent margins. For CVS, having an insurer steer a lot of customers its way might help neuter the Amazon threat.

Of course, CVS’s strategy may have side effects of its own. U.S. politicians and consumers have become increasingly critical of the high cost and murkiness of drug pricing. Transparency may be coming regardless of what deals are made.",Breakingviews - Aetna bid is a defensive prescription for CVS,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-aetna-bid-is-a-defensive-prescription-for-cvs-idUSKBN1CV3OK

All-rounder Stokes was arrested last month after an incident on a night out in Bristol following a one-day international, and released without charge, but remains under police investigation.

England arrived in Perth on Sunday without the suspended Stokes, who could join up with his team mates later on but Root suggested the hosts would not let his men forget about the reasons behind their vice-captain’s absence.

”Potentially they might (sledge us about Stokes),“ Root told a news conference. ”But Ashes cricket - there’s always an edge of psychological banter.

”Once you’ve played in a few, you know what to expect and you know how it goes leading up to the games. I‘m sure there will be plenty of banter flying around on and off the field.

“That’s something you’ve got to cherish and relish and be able to look back on at the end of your career and say, ‘I gave it my best shot, and I enjoyed it’.”

Stokes is a vital part of the team and key to England’s hopes of avoiding a repeat of a humiliating 5-0 whitewash on their last trip to Australia four years ago.

“We’ve got to plan as if he’s not going to be here and give ourselves the best chance.”

England begin their preparations for the series with a two-day tour match against Western Australia XI at the WACA Ground starting on Saturday.

Mark Garnier, a junior international trade minister, asked secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy two sex toys and he also called her “sugar tits”, the Mail on Sunday reported.

Garnier told the newspaper that the comment was part of an amusing conversation about a television show, and that asking her to buy the toys was “good humored high jinks”.

Edmondson, in comments to the paper, disputed Garnier’s recollection of the incidents, including his assertion that they were “high jinks”.

Garnier was not immediately available for comment to Reuters through his constituency or parliamentary offices.

The report comes after May’s spokeswoman said on Friday any unwanted sexual behavior was “completely unacceptable” and any minister who acted inappropriately would face “serious action”.

She was reacting to a report in another British newspaper that described a culture of sexual harassment among lawmakers and their staff working in parliament.

Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said on Sunday May had asked officials to investigate if Garnier, whose role is outside the cabinet immediately surrounding the May, had broken the government ministers’ code of behavior.

“These stories, if they are true, are obviously totally unacceptable,” Hunt told BBC television.

“The Cabinet Office will be conducting an investigation as to whether there has been a breach of the ministerial code in this particular case, but as you know the facts are disputed.”

May will also write to John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, to ask for his advice about changing the culture there, Hunt said.

Reports of inappropriate behavior in British politics, and in other industries, have followed dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove apologized on Saturday after he likened being interviewed by a BBC radio presenter to entering Weinstein’s bedroom. After the analogy was widely criticized, Gove apologized for what he said was a “clumsy attempt at humor”.

The Sun newspaper said on Friday that women working in politics in Westminster had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators.

“The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics,” May’s spokeswoman said on Friday.",British minister to be investigated over sexual harassment allegation,https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-harassment/british-minister-to-be-investigated-over-sexual-harassment-allegation-idINKBN1CY0H4?il=0

Spain’s constitutional court has also started a review of Catalonia’s independence vote for prosecutors to decide if it constituted rebellion.

While there was no indication Puigdemont was hoping to come to Belgium, the country is one of few members of the European Union where EU citizens can ask for political asylum.

“It is not unrealistic if you look at the situation,” Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, told Belgian broadcaster VTM.

“They are already talking about a prison sentence,” Francken, a member of Flemish nationalist party N-VA, said. “The question is to what extent he would get a fair trial.”

It would be difficult for Spain to extradite Puigdemont in such a case, he said.

While most European leaders have refrained from commenting on the Spanish crisis, saying it was an internal matter and the country’s constitution should prevail, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called for dialogue between Madrid and Barcelona[nL8N1MD34Z].

Michel, a centrist from French-speaking Wallonia, has governed in coalition with the N-VA since 2014, a period during which the party toned down its calls for more independence for Belgium’s Dutch-speaking North.

The relationship between Belgium and Spain soured over a similar issue in the 1990s and 2000s, when the country refused to extradite a Spanish couple wanted over alleged involvement with the Basque militant group ETA.",'Not unrealistic' for Catalan leader to get asylum in Belgium: minister,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia-belgium/not-unrealistic-for-catalan-leader-to-get-asylum-in-belgium-minister-idUSKBN1CY07I

Gold prices in India slipped to 29,209 rupees per 10 grams on Friday, the lowest level in about two months.

Prices in India were at a premium of up to $3 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, up from $2 last week. The slight increase in premiums was due to traders looking to cover for purchases made when rates were higher.

“After Diwali, demand falters every year. This year, even during Diwali demand was lower than usual,” said Daman Prakash Rathod, a director at MNC Bullion, a wholesaler in Chennai.

Last week, Indians celebrated the Diwali and Dhanteras festivals, when buying bullion is considered auspicious.

“Jewellers have to replenish inventory after Diwali sales. Since prices are falling, they will do it very slowly,” said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank.

“In the last few days the government was selling gold bonds. Some investors are giving preference to bonds over physical gold due to tax benefits.”

Meanwhile, benchmark spot gold prices were headed for an about 1 percent weekly decline, having hit a near three-month low of $1,264.15 on Friday.

The drop in rates, however, failed to reignite interest for gold in most Asian hubs.

“In Singapore, several businesses in the region referred to as ‘Little India’ have said that the festival sales were not great and that it had come down when compared to the Diwali season in the last two years,” said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.

“Physical demand didn’t really pick up despite lower prices. While we did have businesses and individuals calling us today due to the price drop, prices had been stagnant for the rest of the week.”

Premiums of 50 cents were being charged over the benchmark in Singapore this week, unchanged from the previous week, while in Hong Kong, they rose to the 60 cents to $1.30 range, as against 50 cents last week.

“There are sporadic large transactions, by buyers who take advantage of the price level and the low premiums, but overall, the market is quiet,” said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner of J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.

In top consumer China, premiums of $6.5-$10 an ounce were being charged over the benchmark, compared with $8-$12 in the previous week.

“There has been some amount of buying in China,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. He, however, said there seems to be a shift toward stocks rather than gold in terms of investments.

Reuters reported in June that McAfee was among several Western technology companies that had acceded in recent years to greater demands by Moscow for access to source code, the instructions that control basic operations of computer equipment.

The reviews, conducted in secure facilities known as “clean rooms” by Russian companies with expertise in technology testing, are required by Russian defense agencies for the stated purpose of ensuring no hidden “backdoors” exist in foreign-made software.

But security experts and former U.S. officials have said those inspections provide Russia with opportunities to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited in offensive cyber operations.

McAfee ended the reviews earlier this year after spinning off from Intel in April as an independent company, a McAfee spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters last week.

The company declined to give a precise timeline for when it stopped allowing such reviews.

“The new McAfee has defined all its own new processes, reflecting business, competitive and threat landscapes unique to our space,” the spokeswoman said. “This decision is a result of this transition effort.”

She added that there had been no evidence of a security issue related to the reviews.

McAfee’s decision follows a similar move by competitor Symantec, which in early 2016 adopted a global policy of refusing to comply with any government-mandated source code reviews required to win entry to a market.

Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clark told Reuters earlier this month the decision resulted from fears the agreements would compromise the security of its products.

Reuters reported this month that Hewlett Packard Enterprise allowed one such testing company, Echelon, to review on behalf of a Russian defense agency the source code of cyber defense software known as ArcSight, which is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks.

That arrangement has prompted questions from lawmakers in Washington amid broader concerns about Russia’s use of digital means to sow discord and interference in elections in the United States and other Western countries, allegations the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.

In a letter last week to Defense Secretary James Mattis, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen asked how the Pentagon manages risks when using software that has been scrutinized by foreign governments.

HPE has said in the past that such reviews have taken place for years at a research and development center it operates outside of Russia.

The software maker has also said it closely supervised the process and that no code was allowed to leave the premises, ensuring it did not compromise the safety of its products. A company spokeswoman said earlier this month that no current HPE products have undergone Russian source code reviews.

ArcSight was sold to British tech company Micro Focus International Plc in a deal completed in September.

Micro Focus said this month that while source code reviews were a common industry practice, it would restrict future reviews by “high-risk” governments and subject them to chief executive approval.

McAfee also allowed Echelon to review its software source code, Reuters reported in June. Such tests were conducted in a secure environment at a McAfee facility in the United States where the source code could not be copied, a spokeswoman said.

The company spokeswoman said the new policy would prohibit third-party entities, including Echelon, from doing reviews on behalf of governments.",McAfee says it no longer will permit government source code reviews,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-russia-mcafee/mcafee-says-it-no-longer-will-permit-government-source-code-reviews-idUSKBN1CV2MP

FILE PHOTO -- Replacement pipe is stored near crude oil storage tanks at Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain Pipeline terminal in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada November 15, 2016. REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo

The company, a unit of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), on Thursday asked the National Energy Board for approval to start some construction work in Burnaby as it has been unable to obtain the necessary permits from the city.

Kinder Morgan said delays were costing it millions of dollars every month and the city was failing to act in a “timely manner.”

The Trans Mountain expansion would triple capacity on the existing pipeline from the oil-rich province of Alberta to the British Columbia coast to 890,000 barrels per day, and was approved by the federal government last year despite fierce opposition from environmentalists, aboriginal groups and some municipalities.

Canada’s oil industry says it needs the expanded pipeline capacity to open up export markets in Asia and boost the price of its landlocked crude.

Officials from the City of Burnaby, home to the marine terminal and tank farm where the pipeline terminates, rebuked Kinder Morgan for appealing to the regulator.

“Because of the size and scope of Kinder Morgan’s project, these approvals take time,” city manager Lambert Chu said in a statement. “For several months city staff have worked diligently and have also met regularly with company representatives in the process as directed by the NEB. Now the company seems to want more.”

Kinder Morgan declined to comment on the City of Burnaby’s statements.

NEB spokesman James Stevenson said the regulator had received the company’s request and would set out a process for reviewing it.

Mayor Derek Corrigan said Kinder Morgan President Ian Anderson came to his office on Wednesday to complain about the permitting process.

Corrigan is a vocal opponent of the pipeline project and has pledged civil disobedience to help disrupt construction. He said on Friday he has no influence on the speed of the municipal regulatory process.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

That is the case with the $14 billion scrapped merger between Clariant and Huntsman, which would have combined two chemical makers with little overlap into what was effectively a conglomerate. Now that the merger is off, Clariant can consider other options. But there is a catch, in the form of the activist duo that killed the deal. Investors now need to know whether they are a catalyst, or an inhibitor.

White Tale, a shop-front for Keith Meister’s Corvex and fellow fund 40 North, bought a 20 percent stake in Clariant to convey its disapproval of the planned merger with U.S. peer Huntsman. Since a two-thirds majority vote was needed to approve the deal, and turnout at shareholder meetings is low, that was the end of that. The 6 percent drop in Clariant’s shares on Oct. 27, equivalent to around $500 million, compares with its $1.8 billion proportional share of the lump-sum value of estimated synergies. Investors had seen the writing on the wall.

Now comes the post-activist chill. White Tale holds shares worth around $1.6 billion in a cyclical business, at a time when interest rates could soon be rising in the world’s major industrial economies. Moreover, Meister’s plan is unclear. While he has had successes pushing KFC owner Yum! Brands into a spin-off of its Chinese business, his track record is hardly that of, say, Nelson Peltz, the seasoned investor calling for a clean-up of consumer brands group P&G, or Meister’s own former boss, Carl Icahn.

Clariant boss Hariolf Kottmann has, he concedes, other options. The company could be a takeover target for a rival like Evonik. And splitting off its plastics and coatings business is an old idea that may still create value. The risk is that the triumphant activist will push too hard to realise rapid cost savings. This is no Akzo Nobel, the troubled Dutch chemicals group pilloried by Elliott Advisors for its inaction when a bid arrived from U.S. peer PPG. White Tale has managed to make Clariant show restraint.

The sources cautioned that while Powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five, Trump had not made a final decision and could always change his mind.

“I will be announcing it sometime next week,” Trump said in a video statement on Instagram. “It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job. I have someone very specific in mind and I think everyone will be very impressed.”

Trump has said he has been considering Powell, as well as Stanford University economist John Taylor, for the post. He also has said he has not ruled out renominating current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February.

He is expected to announce his pick, which would need to win Senate approval, before he departs on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3.

Trump had been working from a short list of five candidates that included his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

A senior administration official said on Wednesday that Trump was unlikely to nominate Cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact tax reform legislation currently being debated in Congress.

Trump has also privately voiced a desire to put his own stamp on the central bank, which has dimmed the prospect of him giving a new term to Yellen, another source said.

The law, which President Donald Trump signed on Aug. 2, requires sanctions on individuals who engage in “a significant transaction” with the Russian entities.

Friday’s action does not itself impose new sanctions, and determinations will be made on a case by case basis, State Department officials said.

Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have complained that Trump has been tardy in enforcing the law, which required the list of Russian entities be ready by Oct. 1.

The list includes major Russian arms makers as well as Rosoboronexport, the state-run Russian arms exporter. Also listed is the St. Petersburg-based Special Technology Center, which former President Barack Obama sanctioned in December, saying it played a role in Moscow’s hacking and other interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Russia has denied such meddling.

State Department officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, indicated the Trump administration would move carefully in imposing sanctions and dealing with issues such as U.S. allies who buy Russian-made weaponry or spare parts.

“There is a significance threshold that would exclude certain things that are less than significant,” one official said. “Obviously we’re going to consider the totality of circumstances.”

State Department guidance released on Friday says that in determining whether a transaction is “significant,” officials would weigh its impact on U.S. national security; its size and scope; and the importance of the deal to Russia’s defense and intelligence sector.

The law requires Trump to impose sanctions by Jan. 29 on transactions that are found to meet the definition and which took place after he signed the legislation in August.

“We’ll be implementing the sanctions legislation robustly, in keeping with our understanding of Congress’ intent and the facts that precipitated that legislation, including interference in our election,” a second State Department official said.

The same official did not dispute a report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had eliminated a department office charged with coordinating economic sanctions. The office traditionally had been led by a senior U.S. diplomat.

The official added that individuals throughout the department work on sanctions and that coordination of such work would continue.","U.S. State Department names Russian defense, intel firms under sanctions law",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/u-s-state-department-names-russian-defense-intel-firms-under-sanctions-law-idUSKBN1CW2XR

A blockbuster deal with Airbus SE (AIR.PA) that saw the European company take control of the CSeries for $1 leaves Bombardier’s commercial aviation division with the soft-selling turboprop and regional jets lines.

Meanwhile, on the rail side, Bombardier recently lost out on a merger with Germany’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and now faces off against China’s merged rail company CRRC Corp (601766.SS) and a soon-to-be-formed European giant in Siemens-Alstom.

Macquarie on Friday said it would tweak 2019 company valuations to focus on corporate jets and rail, in the wake of the Airbus deal and media speculation on further commercial aircraft sales.

While the Airbus partnership boosts the CSeries and potentially Bombardier’s small aerostructures and engineering division, which produces aircraft components, the remaining lines in its commercial aerospace arm are “mature and stay stable at best as the industry changes around them,” according to AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray.

Removal of the CSeries headache means the company can focus on its more profitable rail and business jet divisions.

Yet even there, concerns remain with Moody’s this week downgrading Bombardier partly on “longer-term concerns” about the competitiveness of its rail business and concerns about its “future in the commercial aircraft space.” Bombardier said Moody’s action was “ill-founded.”

Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said recently the firm continues to weigh options for the rail unit. Asked about the future of the commercial aerospace unit on Oct. 20, he told reporters, “Right now the focus is to keep on selling these aircraft.”

“I think they will be forced to take a decision (to) either fix, coast or sell,” U.S. analyst Richard Aboulafia said of the commercial plane unit. “But fix means putting some serious money into product upgrades.”

Upgrading a regional jet with a new engine and wings would cost upwards of $1 billion, an amount likely to be prohibitive for the company as it spends on ramping up its CSeries and bringing its strong-selling Global 7000 to market, analysts say.

Bombardier has long weighed a sale or partnership venture to boost orders for its Q400 prop planes, which trail European rival ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo SpA (LDOF.MI). Such a deal, however, would be complicated by the need to ensure Canadian job security because the aircraft are assembled in Canada, government and union sources said.

Bombardier tried unsuccessfully in 2013 to sell 100 Q400 turboprops in Russia and set up a joint-venture assembly line there.

The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug.

CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No. 3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday. It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize.

If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.

“It’s an alternate model at this point. It’s not clear that it’s definitely a better one,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said. “More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.”

For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.

But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies.

UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.

Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path. It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years. That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.

CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp. If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cigna’s interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.

Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.

The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.

Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.

SWINGING PENDULUM

Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.

Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.

UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.

Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.

Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.

Clashes in Kawangware and in a village in western Kenya following Thursday’s vote were the first signs that face-offs between Odinga supporters and the police might eventually morph into neighbors turning against each other.

“A country cannot be ruled by the gun. Standing here in this church we want to condemn the militarization of politics in this country,” Odinga told residents in the Nairobi slum.

The veteran opposition leader had boycotted the re-run of an August presidential election that was nullified by Kenya’s Supreme Court on procedural grounds, leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta with an almost free run against six minor candidates.

On Friday, a day after the repeat vote was held in most of the country, ethnic violence in Kawangware saw dozens of homes and shops torched and one man killed. Most of buildings torched belonged to residents from the Kenyatta’s Kikuyu tribe.

One man from Odinga’s Luo group was killed overnight near Koguta village in the west of the country, after residents from two ethnic groups backing different candidates armed themselves.

If such isolated incidents become a trend, it could ignite large swathes of Kenya, as happened after a 2007 presidential election when weeks of violence left 1,200 dead. That sent ripples throughout East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and diplomatic hub.

In his speech, Odinga condemned violence generally and did not single out any particular attack.

“We have come here to give consolation to those who were beaten and killed. We as NASA condemn what happened,” he told worshippers at a church in Kawangware, referring to his National Super Alliance, an opposition coalition.

Odinga boycotted Thursday’s vote because he said the contest would not be fair. Instead, he wanted the Oct. 26 contest dismissed and fresh elections held within 90 days.

His withdrawal means Kenyans are watching the turnout, rather than the result, for an indication of Kenyatta’s popularity for a second, five-year term.

Results published on Sunday by the election commission showed that Kenyatta had won slightly more than 98 percent of the vote with results in from 244 out of 291 constituencies.

Turnout for the constituencies counted so far was 43 percent. That figure is likely to decrease when it includes returns of 0 from least 23 constituencies where authorities were unable to open even a single polling station because of protests by Odinga’s supporters.

Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement.

He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,” Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.

The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.

Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.

“You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?” Rouhani said.

“Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.

IAEA HEAD VISITS

Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.

“Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,” it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.

“For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.”

Trump’s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano’s agency is in charge of policing.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal.

Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano: “He has no request in this area,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America’s preferred course.","Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-missiles/rouhani-says-iran-will-keep-producing-missiles-state-tv-reports-idUSKBN1CY04S?il=0

Clashes in Kawangware and in a village in western Kenya following Thursday’s vote were the first signs that face-offs between Odinga supporters and the police might eventually morph into neighbors turning against each other.

“A country cannot be ruled by the gun. Standing here in this church we want to condemn the militarization of politics in this country,” Odinga told residents in the Nairobi slum.

The veteran opposition leader had boycotted the re-run of an August presidential election that was nullified by Kenya’s Supreme Court on procedural grounds, leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta with an almost free run against six minor candidates.

On Friday, a day after the repeat vote was held in most of the country, ethnic violence in Kawangware saw dozens of homes and shops torched and one man killed. Most of buildings torched belonged to residents from the Kenyatta’s Kikuyu tribe.

One man from Odinga’s Luo group was killed overnight near Koguta village in the west of the country, after residents from two ethnic groups backing different candidates armed themselves.

If such isolated incidents become a trend, it could ignite large swathes of Kenya, as happened after a 2007 presidential election when weeks of violence left 1,200 dead. That sent ripples throughout East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and diplomatic hub.

In his speech, Odinga condemned violence generally and did not single out any particular attack.

“We have come here to give consolation to those who were beaten and killed. We as NASA condemn what happened,” he told worshippers at a church in Kawangware, referring to his National Super Alliance, an opposition coalition.

Odinga boycotted Thursday’s vote because he said the contest would not be fair. Instead, he wanted the Oct. 26 contest dismissed and fresh elections held within 90 days.

His withdrawal means Kenyans are watching the turnout, rather than the result, for an indication of Kenyatta’s popularity for a second, five-year term.

Results published on Sunday by the election commission showed that Kenyatta had won slightly more than 98 percent of the vote with results in from 244 out of 291 constituencies.

Turnout for the constituencies counted so far was 43 percent. That figure is likely to decrease when it includes returns of 0 from least 23 constituencies where authorities were unable to open even a single polling station because of protests by Odinga’s supporters.

“At least we have something left,” he said, standing in a room with clothes, toys, ornaments and damaged pictures strewn across the floor.

“Others have nothing. They lost their homes, they lost their lives.”

Ismail, 44, the Imam of a nearby mosque, considers himself one of the luckiest people in Marawi. The city was devastated by more than 150 days of battles between government forces and pro-Islamic State militants that killed more than 1,100 people and displaced some 350,000.

His house is in Marawi’s safe zone, an area long abandoned by residents but untouched by unrelenting shelling and military air strikes that have all but flattened the city’s commercial heart, destroying thousands of homes, shops and vehicles.

Six days after troops killed the last remaining rebels, Ismail was among about 4,000 people allowed to return to their homes on Sunday in Marawi’s Basak Malutlot area.

Many like him have discovered their houses were looted and left in disarray.

“I opened the door and I was shocked, but I‘m still happy to be home,” he said.

Ismail fled with his family on May 24 during a fierce three-day firefight that erupted just 50 metres away, when security forces tried to raid the hideout of notorious militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State’s anointed “emir” in Southeast Asia.

Hapilon escaped, then issued a call to arms to hundreds of insurgents to initiate their planned takeover of Marawi. It sparked the Philippines’ biggest urban battle in recent history, and fears that Islamic State’s extremist agenda had gained a foothold in the south of the mainly Catholic country.

HAPPY HOMECOMING

There were scenes of joy and chaos as a convoy of returning residents poured in to Marawi to a cacophony of horns and whistles, jamming what only a few hours earlier were deserted streets.

Armed police at checkpoints cross-checked documents and pictures of each passengers from the 712 families, to guard against possible infiltration by militants.

Retired government employee Mitormar Goling, 72, came home to find jewellery, money, furniture and antiques had been stolen. He said he feared he would have starved or been killed had he stayed behind.

“We felt the ground trembling from the air strikes. We didn’t know if the army could protect us,” said Goling, wearing sunglasses and a white skull cap.

The cross-party commission, comprising 40 parliamentarians, was set up to look into the scandals and crises that have rocked Italian banks in recent years.

“Only the commission as a whole will be able to make a final judgment, but indications of improper behavior have certainly been found,” Casini said in the interview published on Sunday.

Casini said the initial findings pointed to a “network of complicity” that resulted in offers of employment and consultancy jobs.

“It’s certainly not a good thing seeing Bank of Italy directors quickly take up top positions at the banks that were the target of inquiries,” Casini said. “If this had happened to a politician, it would certainly have triggered a chorus of deserved criticism.”

The cross-party commission has the same investigative powers as the magistrature, although it has little to reach conclusions before the legislature ends. The role of the Bank of Italy and market watchdog Consob, which share supervision of the sector, is expected to come under scrutiny.

The government has had to spend more than 20 billion euros ($23.22 billion) this year to prop up the sector, injecting 5.4 billion euros to salvage Italy’s fourth-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), and offering billions of euros in guarantees as it wound down two major banks in the Veneto region.

Four other, smaller banks were wound down in 2015, hitting thousands of small savers.

Critics have accused both the Bank of Italy and Consob of failing in their oversight duties - allegations both bodies have rejected.

Casini said, however, that the initial findings also showed how many of the judiciary investigations had been triggered by inspections launched by the Bank of Italy itself.

“It’s a mix bag of positives and negatives. We need to understand which had dominated,” he said.

Asked about a risk that the inquiry could serve only as electoral propaganda before a forthcoming election, Casini said he had voiced the same concerns when the commission was set up but now would seek to guarantee that it does not become “political battleground”.

Chief executive officer Timotheus Hoettges also urged the new German government to think twice before selling down its large stake in Deutsche Telekom, according to an interview in Welt am Sonntag.

T-Mobile US, majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, is close to agreeing tentative terms on a deal to merge with Sprint Corp, people familiar with the matter have said, a breakthrough in efforts to merge the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers.

Hoettges, in the interview published on Sunday, declined to comment directly on talks between the companies.

“In the U.S. there is a duopoly between two very big players, and then there are two smaller players well behind,” he said. “A third strong player would be good for competition.”

Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N) are the two largest wireless carriers.

Competition regulators have in the past quashed consolidation efforts by T-Mobile, but Hoettges said chances are now better under U.S. President Donald Trump.

“History has taught us that governments led by Republicans are more hands-off than Democratic administrations,” he said.

On the German state’s nearly 32 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom, Hoettges acknowledged it would be the new government’s decision whether to sell or keep.

But he said those who argued for a sale “should perhaps ask themselves who will buy the stake”.

“What interest would the owner have in infrastructure security? Would the owner want to invest in Germany, and if so, where and in particular, how much?”

Corcoran struggles constantly to make funds available from the county budget for the likes of drug treatment centers, the county jail and anti-drug education programs.
“The declaration of an opioid public health emergency and not a state of national emergency does not go far enough,” said NACCHO’s Laura Hanen, the association’s interim executive director.
He said the county jail has roughly 120 inmates, the majority of whom are incarcerated for a drug-related crime.
Additional federal funds would be vital to help finance treatment centers for inmates once they are released, something the county cannot afford.","COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - Doug Corcoran is in the trenches every day in the fight against the opioid crisis in the rural Ohio county he helps oversee.

So President Donald Trump’s failure this week to formally declare the overdose epidemic a “national emergency” - words that would have freed up more federal funds to tackle the crisis - was disappointing for him.

“I have been hopeful for the last several years that the federal government would step up and help us with this crisis, and they haven’t. They’ve really dropped the ball on this and it’s sad,” said Corcoran, a county commissioner in Ross County, home to 77,000 people an hour south of Columbus, Ohio.

The county’s child services budget nearly doubled in the past five years to almost $2.4 million from $1.3 million, because of the number of children needing care due to addicted parents. For a county with a general fund of $23 million, that is a stress on the finances.

Corcoran struggles constantly to make funds available from the county budget for the likes of drug treatment centers, the county jail and anti-drug education programs.

The disappointment about Trump’s announcement is more bitter in Ross County given that more than 60 percent of the county voted for the Republican at last year’s presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.

ACROSS THE COUNTRY

Corcoran, who attended a youth education event about opioids on Friday in the city of Chillicothe, is not alone as the crisis strains local budgets across the country.

Brian Namey, a spokesman for the National Association of Counties, which represents 3,069 county and local governments, said Trump’s declaration on Thursday that the opioid crisis is a “public health emergency” rather than a national emergency lasts only 90 days and frees up no additional federal funds.

“We strongly urge the administration to release additional money to confront this emergency,” Namey said.

The opioid epidemic played a role in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The death rate has kept rising, both in cities and in many rural areas across the country, estimates show.

Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, in addition to heroin and fentanyl - a pain medicine 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine - are fueling the drug overdoses. More than 100 Americans die daily from related overdoses, according to the CDC.

Republican lawmakers called the president’s declaration an important step in combating the crisis. Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said it was meaningless without additional funding.

The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), representing nearly 3,000 local health departments, also expressed disappointment that Trump did not go further and call the crisis a national emergency.

“The declaration of an opioid public health emergency and not a state of national emergency does not go far enough,” said NACCHO’s Laura Hanen, the association’s interim executive director. “We strongly urge the Administration to act further and release additional monies to bring this emergency to an end.”

Matt Osterberg is a county commissioner in rural Pike County, Pennsylvania. He said the county jail has roughly 120 inmates, the majority of whom are incarcerated for a drug-related crime.

The county of 55,000 has an overall annual budget of $42 million. It spends $3.5 million annually treating drug addicts inside the jail, but often when inmates are released they start taking drugs again and end up back behind bars.

Additional federal funds would be vital to help finance treatment centers for inmates once they are released, something the county cannot afford.

“If people got proper intensive treatment after they get out of jail, that would be my dream,” Osterberg said.","In pro-Trump Ohio county, opioid announcement disappoints",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-opioids-ohio/in-pro-trump-ohio-county-opioid-announcement-disappoints-idUSKBN1CW2QE

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

EasyJet said late on Friday it would enter into leases for up to 25 A320 aircraft, acquire take-off and landing slots, and offer jobs to staff, making the announcement shortly after Air Berlin’s final flight landed at Tegel. [nL8N1N21Y9]]

The purchase price is 40 million euros ($46.43 million), but this does not include any transition costs and because Air Berlin planes are leased, those will have to be funded separately.

Air Berlin said on Saturday that the deal meant it had successfully closed all negotiations for its carve-up. It added sale talks with easyJet had been held since the early summer. The British carrier declined to comment on the timeline.

The deal will make easyJet, which currently operates only out of Berlin Schoenefeld airport, the leading carrier in the German capital, it said.

“This will enable easyJet to operate the leading short haul network at Tegel connecting passengers to and from destinations across Germany and the rest of Europe,” easyJet said in a statement.

In comparison, Lufthansa, which is taking on Air Berlin operations with about 81 aircraft, expects to invest around 1.5 billion euros in total. That includes a purchase price of 210 million euros and fleet investments of around 1 billion.

The deal with easyJet, subject to regulatory approval, could help to ease some of the worries with the Lufthansa deal, because it gives Lufthansa a competitor in the domestic German market.

Air Berlin had been the main rival for inner-Germany routes, while others like easyJet and Ryanair had focused on routes to and from Germany.

Air Berlin was founded nearly 40 years ago and carried around 30 million passengers a year. It was beloved by Germans for its flights to holiday island Mallorca and also for the chocolate hearts it gives out after each flight, but filed for administration in August after years of losses.

Thomas Cook’s German airline Condor, which had also been interested in some of Air Berlin, declined to comment on Saturday.

The grounding of Air Berlin from Saturday means passengers in Germany could struggle to find plane tickets this winter. Lufthansa is using bigger planes meant for intercontinental routes on some short trips but says it cannot make up the gap on its own.

EasyJet said it would run a reduced timetable at Tegel during the winter, but would aim for a complete summer schedule in 2018.

The airline will look to recruit around 1,000 Air Berlin pilots and cabin crew, on local contracts and has also written to crew at its Hamburg base, which it is closing, to say there is a place for them in Tegel if they want.

The 27-year-old former world number one entered the contest having lost to the evergreen Williams seven times in as many matches but the resilient Dane served and retrieved brilliantly and emerged with a deserved victory after 89 minutes.

Wozniacki was faultless for an hour as she raced to a one-set and 5-0 lead but Williams always plays to win and the 37-year-old American reeled off four games in a row before the Dane could finally lift the title at the elite, eight-woman event in her fifth appearance.

“It was all going well at 5-0 in the second set, then she went for her shots and I was just so happy to get it done in the end,” Wozniacki, who will rise three places to third in the world rankings after the win, said in a courtside interview.

“Well eight is my lucky number and I figured if I was ever going to beat her it would be today... and I just went out there and did my best.”

The first three games were dominated by the server until the Dane started to find the corners with her powerful backhand and fashioned the first break of the match with back-to-back winners off both flanks.

Williams was trying to get to the net at every opportunity and came forward to good effect after dropping her serve. A vicious cross-court backhand enabled the American to break back immediately on her way to leveling the score at 3-3.

She continued to be the aggressor but the Dane held on in the face of some brutal hitting for her opponent and somehow forged her second break of the set with some exquisite deep hitting to move within one game of taking the opener.

The American came roaring back once more, leaving the Dane looking on as a helpless spectator, with a barrage of winners to get the high-class contest back on serve.

After working so hard to stay in touch, Williams would have been deeply frustrated to gift her opponent the set when the Dane did not have to work to seize the third break in a row, the wayward American sending forehands wide, long and into the net.

Wozniacki had seized the momentum with her variation, depth of shot and complete lack of errors preventing Williams from grabbing any sort of foothold in the contest and the flying Dane raced into a 5-0 lead in 11 second-set minutes.

Needing to hold serve just to stay in the contest, Williams found her rhythm to belatedly get on the scoreboard in the second set and then secured her first break of the second with some solid play against an increasingly anxious Wozniacki.

Williams suddenly appeared relaxed and free, holding easily to heap more pressure on the Dane before stretching every muscle and sinew in an impressive ninth game to break once more and get it back to 5-4.

The crowd wanted more but Wozniacki was not prepared to give them what they wanted, breaking again and sealing victory on her second match point with a backhand winner down the line, and tossing her racket in the air as she celebrated a stunning triumph.

The decision would mark the Trump administration’s most symbolic land designation to date, reflecting its broader effort to boost development on federal land while rolling back Obama-era environmental and conservation efforts.

(GRAPHIC: here#Lands)

The two Utah sites, Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, are among several that U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has recommended reducing in size in order to make way for more industrial activity.

Zinke was charged by a Trump executive order in April to review some 27 such monuments that were created by past presidents under the Antiquities Act - a century-old law that protects cultural artifacts and other historical objects but which Trump has said has been misused as a way to put huge tracts of land off limits to development.

Former President Barack Obama designated the 1.35-million-acre Bears Ears site - named for its iconic twin buttes - as a national monument during his final days in office.

“I was incredibly grateful the President called this morning to let us know that he is approving Secretary Zinke’s recommendation on Bears Ears,” Hatch said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The statement did not provide details on the exact changes to the boundaries or the legal mechanism the administration might use to make the changes.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, when asked about the monument decision, said she did not want to get ahead of the president’s announcement. “I can tell you he (Trump) will be going to Utah in the first part of early December,” she said.

Trump met with Zinke in the Oval Office on Friday.

Sanders said both Trump and Zinke spoke to Hatch and Utah’s other U.S. senator, Mike Lee, during the course of the meeting. Lee has also supported shrinking the sites.

While national parks are created by Congress largely to protect outstanding scenic features or natural phenomena, national monuments are created by presidents, in recognition of a site’s cultural, historical or scientific importance.

Industry groups like the oil lobbying organization the American Petroleum Institute have said in the past that both Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante were unfairly designated as monuments and needed to be reviewed.

Green groups and scientists have supported the designations and condemned any move to reduce their size.

“Any efforts to take away protections for America’s lands and waters will be met by deep opposition and with the law on our side,” said Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, in a statement on Friday.

The Navajo, who consider Bears Ears sacred ground, on Friday followed up their comment in September that they would sue the Trump administration for violating the Antiquities Act if it tried to reduce the monument’s size.

“The Navajo Nation stands ready to defend the Bears Ears National Monument. We have a complaint ready to file upon official action by the President.” Ethel Branch, the Navajo Nation’s attorney general, said in an email to Reuters on Friday.

Grand Staircase, which was designated a national monument by President Bill Clinton in 1996, has drawn concern because an archeological site lies beneath it where two dozen new species of dinosaurs have been discovered. A coal deposit also lies beneath Grand Staircase. Paleontologists are worried the site could be destroyed if the monument’s size is reduced, the Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday.

A spokesman for Representative Rob Bishop, a Republican from Utah who is chairman of the House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, said on Friday that Bishop was working on legislation “that will protect the antiquities in the Bears Ears region, ensure that local voices are heard and bring some finality to this issue once and for all.”","Trump to shrink Utah national monuments in bid to boost drilling, mining",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-monument/trump-to-shrink-two-utah-national-monuments-senator-says-idUSKBN1CW2PY

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement.

He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,” Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.

The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.

Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.

“You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?” Rouhani said.

“Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.

IAEA HEAD VISITS

Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.

“Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,” it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.

“For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.”

Trump’s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano’s agency is in charge of policing.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal.

Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano: “He has no request in this area,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America’s preferred course.","Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports",https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-missiles/rouhani-says-iran-will-keep-producing-missiles-state-tv-reports-idINKBN1CY04W?il=0

Le président du gouvernement espagnol Mariano Rajoy a annoncé vendredi, quelques heures après cette proclamation unilatérale d‘indépendance, la destitution de l‘exécutif autonome de Catalogne, la dissolution du Parlement régional et la tenue d‘élections anticipées le 21 décembre dans la région.

La vice-présidente du gouvernement espagnol, Soraya Saenz Santamaria, a été chargée de superviser le processus de reprise en main de la région par le pouvoir central.

Dans une brève déclaration samedi, Carles Puigdemont a accusé Madrid d’“agression préméditée” contre la volonté du peuple catalan de se constituer en Etat indépendant.

“Il est très clair que la meilleure manière de défendre les gains obtenus jusqu‘ici est une opposition démocratique à l‘article 155”, a déclaré Carles Puigdemont.

L‘article 155 de la Constitution espagnole est la disposition juridique qui a permis la mise sous tutelle directe du pouvoir central de la région de Catalogne.

Mais, le président déchu de la Généralité de Catalogne est resté vague sur les mesures à prendre par les partisans de la sécession alors que les autorités madrilènes ont commencé à prendre des mesures de gestion directe de la région.

“Nous continuons à persévérer dans la seule attitude qui peut nous faire gagner. Sans violence, sans insultes, (...) en respectant les gens et les symboles, et aussi en respectant les protestations des Catalans qui ne sont pas d‘accord avec ce qu‘a décidé la majorité parlementaire”, a-t-il dit.

Carles Puigdemont a signé cette déclaration en tant que président de la Catalogne, montrant ainsi qu‘il n‘acceptait pas son éviction.

Le porte-parole du gouvernement, Inigo Mendez de Vigo, a déclaré dans un entretien à Reuters TV que si l‘ex-président de la Généralité de Catalogne voulait continuer dans la politique, “ce qui est bien, je pense qu‘il devrait se préparer pour les prochaines élections” régionales prévues le 21 décembre.

Il n‘a en revanche pas précisé ce que ferait le gouvernement si Carles Puigdemont refusait d‘abandonner ses fonctions, déclarant seulement que Madrid réagirait avec “intelligence et bon sens”.

Les partisans d‘une sécession estiment que le référendum du 1er octobre, où le oui” à l‘indépendance l‘a massivement emporté, leur a donné mandat pour organiser l‘indépendance, bien que moins de la moitié des 5,3 millions d‘électeurs potentiels aient voté et que Madrid ait déclaré ce scrutin illégal.

NEUTRALITÉ

Pour apaiser les tensions, la police régionale catalane, les Mossos d‘Esquadra, a appelé ses officiers à ne pas prendre parti, selon une note interne que Reuters a pu consulter samedi.

Des doutes ont émergé sur la réponse qu‘apporteraient les Mossos d‘Esquadra si ordre leur était donné d‘évincer par la force Carles Puigdemont et les membres de l‘exécutif régional.

Les Mossos sont tiraillés entre pro et anti-indépendantistes, soulignent certains de leurs responsables ainsi que des membres de la police nationale. Certains officiers des Mossos se sont interposés entre la police nationale et ceux qui tentaient de voter durant le référendum d‘indépendance.

Le chef de la police catalane Josep Lluis Trapero, qui fait partie des personnes destituées, était devenu le héros des indépendantistes parce que ses forces s‘étaient montrées nettement moins dures que la police nationale pour faire appliquer l‘interdiction de tenue du référendum. La Haute cour de Madrid lui a interdit le 16 octobre de se rendre à l‘étranger et a ordonné la confiscation de son passeport.

Il est accusé de ne pas avoir ordonné de sauver des membres de la police nationale coincés dans un bâtiment à Barcelone lors des manifestations d‘indépendantistes du mois dernier.

Dans la note interne vue par Reuters, les policiers régionaux sont invités à agir en professionnels.

“Etant donné qu‘il y aura probablement une multiplication des rassemblements de citoyens sur tout le territoire et que ces citoyens ont des opinions différentes, nous devons rappeler qu‘il est de notre responsabilité de garantir la sécurité de tous et d‘aider ces rassemblements à se dérouler sans incident”, peut-on lire dans cette note non signée.

“Nous devons tous nous souvenir que nous représentons une institution à laquelle nous appartenons et non des individus, et que nous devons par conséquent agir avec neutralité dans tous les cas.”

Une manifestation pour l‘unité de l‘Espagne a rassemblé samedi un millier de personnes à Madrid après le grand rassemblement pacifique organisé vendredi soir à Barcelone par les indépendantistes pour fêter la déclaration de sécession.

The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history.

The Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for this weekend’s attack. The government responded by sacking two of the country’s top security officials.

“So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,” Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters.

At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. And a woman, Madobe Nunow, was beheaded while her “three children were shot dead,” he said.

A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel.

Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said.

The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel’s defenses. Then gunmen stormed the building.

The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.

The government sacked the country’s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, a statement from the prime minister’s office said.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.

”After the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces.

Having already stripped Britain of its top-notch “AAA” rating, both agencies stuck with their “AA” rating for Britain but warned they were likely to downgrade again.

“The negative outlook reflects the continued institutional and economic uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and the UK’s future relationship with its largest market for goods and services, the EU,” S&P said in a statement.

A further downgrade could come if S&P views the risk of a disorderly Brexit as increasingly certain or if overseas investors start to withdraw the capital that finances Britain’s large current account deficit.

Fitch said the lack of a clear British position and the EU’s negotiating stance - not to mention a lack of time before the March 2019 departure date - would make it hard for Britain to emerge with a favorable deal.

Both ratings agencies also pointed to the weakened state of Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, after she gambled her majority in parliament away in an election earlier this year that she did not need to call.

The pilot program aims to speed up the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles into the national airspace system and test drone detection and tracking while waiving some limits on their use.

Under a memorandum signed by Trump on Wednesday, states and local governments would be able to seek Federal Aviation Administration approval for testing and expanded use. The White House stopped short of proposing new regulations that would allow broader nationwide use of drones or any timetable for new authority.

White House adviser Michael Kratsios told reporters the “program will open the skies for delivery of life-saving medicines and commercial packages, inspections of critical infrastructure, support for emergency management operations.”

Kratsios said the program would allow companies and governments to operate drones in ways that are currently restricted by the FAA “including beyond-visual-line-of-sight flights, nighttime operations, and flights over people.”

Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies hoping to make package delivery by drones a reality.

The memo said the Transportation Department could allow drone flights at up to 400 feet with the goal of approving at least five pilot projects. The program would expire in three years.

In 2016, the Obama administration opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use, but left in place significant restrictions.

The FAA estimates by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000.

In June, Trump told drone executives the administration wants “to create new companies and lots of jobs... We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.”

In attendance were chief executives of drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and Precision Hawk Inc.

Drone manufacturers have argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does pre-approve self-driving vehicle technologies.

But security concerns remain.

In September, a civilian drone struck and damaged a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Staten Island, New York.

This month, a drone hit an airplane landing at a Quebec City airport, the first time an unmanned flying object collided with commercial aircraft in Canada.

The FAA has banned drone flights over 133 U.S. military facilities and over 10 U.S. landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty in New York and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, at the request of national security and law enforcement agencies.

The memo said that the Transportation Department would coordinate with the Defense Department, Homeland Security and Justice Department to consider public safety and national security risks in approving pilot projects.

The Commercial Drone Alliance said it was “optimistic that the program will become a model for overcoming some of the hurdles keeping the full potential of commercial drones from being realized.”

Senator John Thune, a Republican, said the new policy “provides sensible direction that promotes drone safety, innovation, and local input.”",Trump administration program to test expanded drone use,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-drones/trump-administration-program-to-test-expanded-drone-use-idUSKBN1CU2EA

While the likes of Dubai, Shanghai and Abu Dhabi have successfully gone some of the way, oil-rich Saudi has limited itself to industrial zones and financial centers – until NEOM. The megalopolis will encompass 26,500 square km, including 468 km of beachfront. It will border Jordan, link across the Red Sea to Egypt, and cost $500 billion to build.

The idea is almost bonkers, but that’s also its beauty. “The project will be the land of the future, where great minds and talents can create ground-breaking ideas and think outside the box, in a real world inspired by imagination,” according to Saudi’s Public Investment Fund, which will oversee the kingdom’s investment in NEOM.

If that’s not ambitious enough, NEOM will “without a doubt” go public, the crown prince told Reuters Breakingviews on Wednesday at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. “It’s as if you float the city of New York,” he said.

Of course New York already exists. And for global investors, the crown prince’s plan requires a healthy suspension of disbelief. But in the context of Saudi Arabia’s hopes to wean its economy off hydrocarbons, nothing can be off limits. Shifting from an era in which oil riches blessed its 33 million people, nearly 60 percent of whom are under 35, to a new model requires extraordinary creativity.

Yet to succeed, Saudi will need doers at least as much as dreamers: architects, engineers and construction workers. That makes the selection of Klaus Kleinfeld as chief executive of NEOM puzzling. In April, he lost the top job at Arconic, the specialty parts maker that split from Alcoa, after inappropriate contact with an activist investor. Before moving to Alcoa in 2007, he resigned as CEO of Siemens after losing the confidence of the industrial conglomerate’s board.

That said, Kleinfeld is a consummate networker. And the crown prince will need every kind of help he can get. The choice does, however, underline the huge challenge.

Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement.

He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,” Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.

The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.

Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.

“You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?” Rouhani said.

“Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.

IAEA HEAD VISITS

Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.

“Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,” it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.

“For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.”

Trump’s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano’s agency is in charge of policing.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal.

Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano: “He has no request in this area,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America’s preferred course.","Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CY04N

Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.

Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.

Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.

The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.

Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis -- underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.

“I‘m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.

“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”

The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.

The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.

Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.

With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.

The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.

In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.

“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.

DAMAGE TO CATALONIA

Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.

European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.

But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.

Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d‘Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.

But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.

Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.

The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.

European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.","Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CY06S

The cross-party commission, comprising 40 parliamentarians, was set up to look into the scandals and crises that have rocked Italian banks in recent years.

“Only the commission as a whole will be able to make a final judgment, but indications of improper behavior have certainly been found,” Casini said in the interview published on Sunday.

Casini said the initial findings pointed to a “network of complicity” that resulted in offers of employment and consultancy jobs.

“It’s certainly not a good thing seeing Bank of Italy directors quickly take up top positions at the banks that were the target of inquiries,” Casini said. “If this had happened to a politician, it would certainly have triggered a chorus of deserved criticism.”

The cross-party commission has the same investigative powers as the magistrature, although it has little to reach conclusions before the legislature ends. The role of the Bank of Italy and market watchdog Consob, which share supervision of the sector, is expected to come under scrutiny.

The government has had to spend more than 20 billion euros ($23.22 billion) this year to prop up the sector, injecting 5.4 billion euros to salvage Italy’s fourth-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), and offering billions of euros in guarantees as it wound down two major banks in the Veneto region.

Four other, smaller banks were wound down in 2015, hitting thousands of small savers.

Critics have accused both the Bank of Italy and Consob of failing in their oversight duties - allegations both bodies have rejected.

Casini said, however, that the initial findings also showed how many of the judiciary investigations had been triggered by inspections launched by the Bank of Italy itself.

“It’s a mix bag of positives and negatives. We need to understand which had dominated,” he said.

Asked about a risk that the inquiry could serve only as electoral propaganda before a forthcoming election, Casini said he had voiced the same concerns when the commission was set up but now would seek to guarantee that it does not become “political battleground”.

The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history.

The Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for this weekend’s attack. The government responded by sacking two of the country’s top security officials.

“So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,” Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters.

At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. And a woman, Madobe Nunow, was beheaded while her “three children were shot dead,” he said.

A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel.

Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said.

The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel’s defences. Then gunmen stormed the building.

The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.

The government sacked the country’s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, a statement from the prime minister’s office said.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.

”After the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces.

Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. The government and al Shabaab typically give different figures for victims in such attacks.

The twin bombings in Mogadishu on Oct. 14 killed at least 358 people, the worst such attacks in the country’s history, igniting nationwide outrage. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but the method - a large truck bomb - is one it has often used.

The country is selling $2 billion of five-and 10-year sovereign dollar bonds, the first such issue since 2004. Despite recent downgrades by global rating agencies, these are likely to yield just 30 to 50 basis points above U.S. Treasury bonds. Local banks can guarantee demand if needed, but there is also a genuine reassessment of China risk underway.

China does not need the money, but the borrowing serves multiple purposes. It helps stabilise cross-border capital flows, refills hard-currency reserves, and makes it easier for companies to refinance in dollars, since there will now be benchmark issues to price against. It is also a rebuke to the credit rating agencies, showing China can brush aside their warnings.

It is already a banner year for offshore fundraising. Thomson Reuters IFR says Chinese issuers have sold $108 billion of overseas bonds in dollars, euros and yen by the end of September, already 24 percent above 2016’s full-year record.

For all the hype about the international yuan, it’s naturally easier for Chinese companies to use dollars for overseas acquisitions. Ditto for “Belt and Road” infrastructure investments. But appetite for dollars has come at the expense of the offshore yuan market, once a policy priority. The Ministry of Finance is only selling 14 billion yuan ($2 billion) of so-called “dim sum” bonds in Hong Kong this year, half of the previous year’s issuance.

Even so, this is an unrated issue by a country infamous for credit-fuelled growth, weak rule of law, and selective respect for international norms. It’s one thing to lend money to the Chinese government, but this will serve as a benchmark for pricing debt sales by other Chinese borrowers, some of them far more opaque.

The MoF has previously manipulated offshore bond sales by force-feeding them to compliant Chinese banks. This simulates demand without market substance. This time around, however, the securities may attract more foreign interest: as the mainland economy has recovered, foreign anxiety has genuinely eased. Spreads on Chinese five-year credit default swaps have fallen sharply in 2017, and now trade more than 20 basis points below South Korea’s.",Breakingviews - Beijing's dollar bonds seek to reprice China risk,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-bonds-breakingviews/breakingviews-beijings-dollar-bonds-seek-to-reprice-china-risk-idUSKBN1CV0BS

Under existing laws, Burundian presidents are limited to two five-year terms.

Unrest that has gripped Burundi since April 2015, when Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would stand for a third, has killed hundreds, left the economy moribund and forced about 400,000 people to seek safety in neighboring countries.

UN rights investigators and independent activists have accused government forces of widespread violations including forced disappearances, and of orchestrating a campaign of terror.

A senior government official told Reuters on Friday that the cabinet adopted the draft legislation seeking to amend the constitution on Tuesday.

Nkurunziza, who has been in office since 2005, won re-election in July 2015 in a ballot that critics said violated the constitution and the terms of an agreement that ended a previous rebellion.

Nkurunziza’s backers said the country’s constitutional court had cleared him to run again, but some opponents took up arms against his rule and insecurity has plagued the country since.

Other African leaders have in the recent past also tinkered with or defied their constitutions to extend their rule, including Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni, Rwanda’s Paul Kagame and Democratic Republic of Congo’s Joseph Kabila.

Proposed amendments under the Burundian bill seek to abolish the two-term limit and lengthen presidential terms to seven years. Incumbents would be able to serve two consecutive terms of seven years each and also be eligible to seek re-election after an interregnum.

If the amendment was passed by parliament, “the current head of state can rule until 2034,” the source said.

A second official told Reuters the government would hold a referendum on the draft legislation next year, but did not say which month.

Opposition officials have criticized the legislation which they say was initiated in secrecy and designed to entrench Nkurunziza in power.

“No one knew what was being done. It was done in total secrecy...we will always oppose it,” deputy president of the opposition FRODEBU party, Leonce Ngendakumana, told Reuters.

With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement’s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament.

Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one.

The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom.

Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust.

The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s use of offshore tax havens.

In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world’s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability.

After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties.

The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament’s 63 seats.

“The opposition has a majority, so that’s a message. But we’ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,” Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday.

The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.

The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament.

The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year’s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland’s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters.

Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said: ”I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it’s normal that we should be a part of a future government.

“We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,” he said. “We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.”

His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.

The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year’s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.

“I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,” said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government.

The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes.

The Pirate Party, which last year rode a wave of anger against the establishment to become the third biggest party in parliament, stood to get 9 percent of votes in Saturday’s election down from 14 percent last year.",Iceland leans toward leftist government in snap election,https://www.reuters.com/article/iceland-election/iceland-leans-toward-leftist-government-in-snap-election-idINKBN1CY025

Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, was elected with 61.1 percent of the vote, the United Conservative Party announced at an event in Alberta’s largest city of Calgary.

Kenney will head a party formed this year from the Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties. It presents a serious challenge in the 2019 provincial election to the incumbent left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), which took power in 2015 helped partly by a divided right.

Alberta, where the Conservatives held power for 40 years before being ousted in a shock election by the NDP, is home to Canada’s vast oil sands and is the largest exporter of crude to the United States. But it has been struggling with a three-year slump in global oil prices and a C$10.3 billion ($8.24 billion) deficit.

Kenney has been eager to develop policies aimed at cutting costs for the oil and gas sector and is likely to be welcomed by the energy industry.

Ein Regierungssprecher sagte am Samstag Reuters TV, es sei das Recht des entmachteten Regierungschefs Carles Puigdemont, weiter in der Politik aktiv zu bleiben. Puigdemont selbst forderte die Separatisten zwar zum Widerstand gegen die Zwangsverwaltung auf. Dieser müsse jedoch friedlich und demokratisch sein, sagte er. In Barcelona und Madrid demonstrierten am Wochenende Zehntausende Spanier friedlich für die Einheit des Landes.

Nach der Verkündung der Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens durch das Regionalparlament am Freitag hatte die Zentralregierung umgehend die dortige Regierung abgesetzt und für den 21. Dezember Neuwahlen angesetzt. Er sei “ziemlich sicher, dass Puigdemont, sollte er an diesen Wahlen teilnehmen, seine demokratische Opposition” ausüben könne, sagte Regierungssprecher Inigo Mendez de Vigo. Sollte der entmachtete Ministerpräsident sich weigern, sein Amt zu verlassen, werde die Regierung mit “Klugheit und gesundem Menschenverstand” reagieren. Auf die Frage nach strafrechtlichen Konsequenzen für Puigdemont sagte der spanische Regierungssprecher: “Niemand steht über dem Gesetz”. Ansonsten verwies er auf die Unabhängigkeit der Justiz.

PUIGDEMONT FÜR “DEMOKRATISCHE OPPOSITION”

In einer Fernsehansprache sagte Puigdemont am Samstag: “Es ist klar, dass demokratische Opposition die beste Art ist, die bis jetzt erreichten Erfolge zu verteidigen.” Er blieb vage, wie der Widerstand konkret aussehen soll. “Wir werden nicht einknicken”, sagte er. “Wir werden an der einzig möglichen Einstellung festhalten, die uns zu Gewinnern machen wird: Ohne Gewalt, ohne Beleidigungen; die alle einbezieht, die die Menschen, Symbole, Meinungen und die den Protest der Katalanen respektiert, die nicht damit einverstanden sind, was die Parlamentsmehrheit beschlossen hat”.

Die größte Separatisten-Gruppe in Katalonien (ANC) hatte am Freitag die Mitarbeiter der Verwaltung in der Region aufgerufen, Anordnungen aus Madrid nicht zu befolgen. Die Bediensteten sollten mit “friedlichem Widerstand” reagieren. Die Gewerkschaft CSC hat für Montag zu einem Streik aufgerufen, der bis zum 9. November dauern soll. Die Regionalregierung hatte daraufhin erklärt, sie werde einen Notdienst aufrecht erhalten.

Die spanischen Behörden begannen derweil mit der Umsetzung der Zwangsverwaltung. Das Innenministerium erklärte, die Zentralen der Parteien, der Häfen und Flughäfen, der Gerichte und der Nationalbank würden gesichert. Notfalls könnten die katalanischen Sicherheitskräfte ersetzt werden. Die Regionalpolizei forderte ihre Beamten auf, sich neutral zu verhalten. Angesichts der emotional angespannten Lage gibt es Unsicherheit darüber, wie sich die in Anhänger und Gegner der Unabhängigkeit gespaltene Regionalpolizei verhalten würde, falls sie etwa den abgesetzten Regierungschef und seine Regierung aus den Regierungsgebäuden vertreiben müsste.

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now that it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson embraces Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi before a meeting of the Saudi-Iraqi Bilateral Coordination Council in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, October 22, 2017. REUTERS/Alex Brandon/Pool

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

** Parallelamente spread Italia-Spagna ha stretto fino a 38 pb, cinque in meno della chiusura di ieri, ai minimi da dicembre 2016.

** A sorpresa la Commissione Ue ha inviato una lettera a diversi Paesi, tra cui l‘Italia, chiedendo chiarimenti sulla manovra 2018, rilevando un aggiustamento sui conti inferiore alle richieste.

** Sono attesi in calo i rendimenti dei Btp a 5 e 10 anni, in asta lunedì insieme al nuovo Ccteu aprile 2025, per un importo totale fino a 8,5 miliardi. In chiusura i benchmark a 5 e 10 anni quotavano rispettivamente a 0,67% (da 0,83% dell‘asta di settembre) e a 1,94% (da 2,19%): in entrambi i casi si tratterebbe di minimi dallo scorso dicembre.

The indictment was sealed under orders from a federal judge so it was not clear what the charges were or who the target was, the source said, adding that it could be unsealed as early as Monday.

The filing of charges by the grand jury in Washington was first reported on Friday by CNN, which said the target could be taken into custody as soon as Monday.

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the election to try to help President Donald Trump defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her campaign.

Special counsel Robert Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is investigating whether Trump campaign officials colluded with those Russian efforts.

“If the Special Counsel finds it necessary and appropriate, the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a May 17 letter appointing Mueller.

Sources familiar with Mueller’s investigation said he has used that broad authority to investigate links between Trump aides and foreign governments as well as possible money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on Friday.

Trump, a Republican who was elected president last November, has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as “a witch hunt”.

The Kremlin has denied the allegations.

Mueller’s investigation also includes an effort to determine whether Trump or any of his aides tried to obstruct justice.

The special counsel’s team has conducted interviews with former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, former spokesman Sean Spicer and other current and former White House officials.

In July, FBI agents raided the home in Virginia of Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose financial and real estate dealings and prior work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine are being investigated by Mueller’s team.

FILE PHOTO: FBI Director Robert Mueller testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on ""Current and Projected National Security Threats to the United States"" on Capitol Hill in Washington March 12, 2013. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo

Mueller was appointed to lead the investigation a week after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was heading a federal probe into possible collusion with Russia.

Trump initially said he fired Comey because his leadership of the FBI was inadequate and hurt morale, but in a later interview with NBC he cited “this Russia thing” as his reason.

SHADOW

The Russia investigation has cast a shadow over Trump’s nine-month-old presidency and widened the partisan rift between Republicans and Democrats.

Republican lawmakers earlier this week launched investigations to examine several of Trump’s longstanding political grievances, including the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton’s emails and her alleged role in a sale of U.S. uranium to a Russian firm.

FILE PHOTO - Then FBI Director Robert Mueller testifies at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S. on February 16, 2011. REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo

Mueller’s team has also investigated Michael Flynn, who was an adviser to Trump’s campaign and later briefly served as his national security adviser.

Flynn was fired from that post in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year.

While he was on Trump’s campaign team, Flynn also had a $600,000 contract from a Turkish businessman to help discredit U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Turkey’s government of instigating a failed coup in July 2016.

Former CIA director James Woolsey, who was also an adviser to the Trump campaign, has alleged that Flynn discussed with the businessman and two Turkish government ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States to face charges in Turkey.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey, said on Friday that Woolsey and his wife have been in communication with the FBI and Mueller’s team about the claim.

Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, “have responded to every request, whether from the FBI, or, more recently, the Office of the Special Counsel,” Franks said in a statement.

Flynn has previously denied through a spokesperson that such a plan was ever discussed.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Woolsey and his wife last year pitched a $10 million project to the same Turkish businessman who had agreed a smaller contract with Flynn. They did not win a contract.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal but Flynn came under scrutiny because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did on the Gulen project.",First charges filed in U.S. special counsel's Russia investigation: source,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-charges/first-charges-filed-in-u-s-special-counsels-russia-investigation-source-idUSKBN1CX00V

The company’s shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.

Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.

“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.

“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”

The company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

FILE PHOTO: An attendee checks out a new iPhone X during an Apple launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam

Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades.

Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday. The base price for the phone is $999.

He noted that Sprint Corp’s iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.

However, electronics retailer Best Buy Co is charging shoppers an extra $100, if they wish to buy an unactivated iPhone X outright.

If customers order the phone on an installment billing plan, they will pay the same price charged by Apple and the carriers.

“Our prices reflect the fact that no matter a customer’s desired plan or carrier, or whether a customer is on a business or personal plan, they are able to get a phone the way they want at Best Buy,” Best Buy spokeswoman Carly Charlson said.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

The “Greater Jerusalem” legislation would put some settlements in the occupied West Bank, built on land Palestinians seek for a future state and viewed as illegal by most countries, under the jurisdiction of Jerusalem’s municipality.

The bill, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, was to have been submitted for approval on Sunday to a ministerial committee on legislation, a first step before a series of ratification votes in parliament.

But Likud lawmaker David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu’s coalition in parliament, said a vote by the cabinet committee would be delayed because Washington told Israel the bill’s passage could impede U.S. efforts to revive peace talks that collapsed in 2014.

“There is American pressure that claims this is about annexation and that this could interfere with the peace process,” Bitan told Army Radio.

“The prime minister doesn’t think this is about annexation. I don’t think so either. We have to take the time to clarify matters to the Americans. Therefore, if the bill passes in a week, or in a month, it’s less problematic,” he said.

Proponents of the legislation say it falls short of formal land annexation to Israel but will enable some 150,000 settlers to vote in Jerusalem city elections. Intelligence Minister Israel Katz, a supporter of the bill, has said this would “ensure a Jewish majority in a united Jerusalem”.

Israel’s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector it captured along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a 1967 Middle East war, has not won international recognition. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Israeli media reports said the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, had conveyed misgivings about the legislation, under which the large Maale Adumim and Beitar Illit settlements would become part of a Greater Jerusalem municipality.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as telling cabinet ministers on Sunday: “The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was all about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth continuing to talk and coordinate with them.”

A U.S. embassy spokeswoman declined immediate comment.

Over 19 million Thais - more than a quarter of the 69 million population - participated in ceremonies by presenting symbolic sandalwood flowers to be burned at temples and crematorium replicas across the country, according to the government.

On Sunday, the late king’s bones were moved to the Chakri Throne Hall, where royal relics are kept within the Grand Palace in a ceremony that involved senior monks from temples across the country. His son, new King Maha Vajiralongkorn, led the religious rite.

On Sunday evening, Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana led the final royal procession on horseback to the Wat Rajabopidh and Wat Bovoranives temples where her grandfather’s ashes were placed in keeping with a ceremony steeped in religious symbolism and tradition. Mourners, some in tears, were gathered outside the temples.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

The rival projections reflected the many unknowns swirling around the plan, expected to be unveiled in legislative form on Wednesday. Republicans were still undecided on some of the hardest parts, such as how to pay for the costly cuts proposed.

Weeks and possibly months of debate lie ahead for a project that Trump promised to tackle in his 2016 election campaign. In September, he unveiled a rough framework for cutting taxes. Now he wants Congress to approve a bill, which would mark his first major legislative victory, before the end of the year.

The Trump plan for tax cuts of the sort normally reserved for times of economic recession is taking shape in Congress amid signs the economy is already growing briskly.

Gross domestic product increased at a 3 percent annual rate in the July-September period, supported by strong business spending on equipment, the Commerce Department said on Friday.

The economic recovery begun under former President Barack Obama after the 2007-2009 recession is in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue amid a tightening labor market.

“It’s hard to say that we need to have tax cuts at the individual level ... you don’t need to provide further fiscal stimulus when the economy is already strong,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey.

Faced with improving economic prospects, Republicans have shifted their rhetoric on tax cuts away from getting the economy moving again to keeping it on an expansion track.

An analysis released by White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said slashing the top federal corporate tax rate and letting businesses write off the full cost of most capital investments immediately, as proposed in the plan, would bring faster growth and higher wages.

Hassett’s projections envisioned a 3 percent to 5 percent increase in GDP that, over 10 years, could represent an additional $700 billion to $1.2 trillion in economic output.

But the Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit Washington think tank, released an analysis that concluded the Trump tax plan would not produce a significant, permanent economic boost.

The group said the plan would reduce federal tax revenue by roughly $2.4 trillion over the next decade and by over $3 trillion in the decade after that, adding significantly to a U.S. national debt that already exceeds $20.4 trillion.

The center said Trump’s tax cuts would drive new activity at first, but that the impact would be blunted in later years by rising deficits, forcing more federal borrowing to finance the tax cuts and driving up borrowing costs for the private sector.

Hassett told reporters he does not expect tax reform to add significantly to the deficit. But he conceded that it would become “a big negative” if economic growth failed to materialize and the debt level soared.

The framework of Trump’s plan unveiled last month called for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the small business rate to 25 percent from up to 39.6 percent and the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent.

It also called specifically for repealing the estate tax on inheritances and the alternative minimum tax, both of which are typically paid by the country’s highest-income earners.

Less clear were the plan’s proposals to reduce the number of tax brackets, enhance the child tax credit and possibly put new limits on popular 401(k) retirement pension plans.

Because details of the unfinished tax legislation are unknown, its economic impact is unclear, said Omer Eisner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

Hours after the Commerce Department reported stronger-than-expected third quarter U.S. economic growth of 3 percent. Hassett said the data did not undercut the need for tax cuts.

He said economic expansion and stronger stock market performance could be undermined if the Republican-controlled Congress fails to enact the tax cuts.

“Firms are optimistic both because of regulatory reform but also because they expect corporate tax reform and overall tax reform,” Hassett said. “The thing that I‘m worried about is that if those expectations prove to be incorrect, then I would expect business capital spending to go back to a disappointing path and equity markets to decline as well.”

Kevin Brady, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives tax committee, said progress was being made toward satisfying Republicans who have held back support for the tax plan because it could end a deduction for state and local taxes. “I‘m hopeful ... we can find a good solution for them,” Brady said.",Rosy White House tax cut forecast clashes with independent analysis,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/rosy-white-house-tax-cut-forecast-clashes-with-independent-analysis-idUSKBN1CW30T?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews
