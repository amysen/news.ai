Nevertheless, the festivities can be complicated, and disheartening, for trick-or-treaters with food allergies.

According to the Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) organization, 5.9 million children under age 18, or 1 in 13 kids, suffer from food hypersensitivities. In response, FARE launched a campaign three years ago that lets homeowners easily signal the trick-or-treaters with food allergies, telling them it’s safe to visit.

The HGTV personality worked with his twin Drew Scott on the book, which hit shelves Sept. 5, but for Jonathan some of the revelations in the tell-all took on a more personal tone.

Jonathan Scott, who has been tight-lipped about his romantic past, opened up about his divorce from an airline-crew scheduler named Kelsey. The two wed in 2007, and though they had been together for more than six years when they got married, the pair called it quits two years later.

“I think when you are young and you don’t really know what you want in life, you can commit to something and think at the time it is right,” he told Fox News.

He said his failed union gave him a new outlook.

“It really gives you perspective,” he said of marriage. “Anyone who has been through failed relationships — even people in successful relationships — understand that you gain perspective about what is important to you.”

Though Scott, 39, has not spoken much about his divorce, he felt it was an important piece of the brothers’ memoir.

“I never talked about my divorce before and anyone who has been through divorce before knows how painful that is,” he revealed. “When I commit to something I commit 100 percent and knowing I failed and we just weren't meant to be together was difficult.”

He wanted to share his tough experience with fans.

“We said if we were going to do a memoir we were only going to do it if it was authentic and it was honest and we did not cut anything out, and we committed to that,” he told us. “The book shows the highs and the lows.”

And Scott isn't dwelling on his divorce. He gushed to us about girlfriend Jacinta Kuznetsov.

“Jacinta and I are madly in love with each other. We are perfect for each other and stand each other’s strengths and weaknesses. I’ve always said I don't regret anything as long as I have learned from it. I think the past relationships I’ve had were very important learning scenarios in my life.”

He said even though he’s been through a divorce, he’s still a strong believer in marriage.

“There is no situation in the world where I would shun marriage just because I had one that didn't work,” he said. “You can have two good people who are just not good for each other and I’ve never been the type of person to wallow in misery.”

Aside from his relationship and recently released book, Scott has been busy working on the new HGTV spinoff “Property Brothers At Home: Drew’s Honeymoon House.” The show, which premieres Nov. 22, chronicles the brothers’ journey to transform a home for Drew and fiancée Linda Phan.

“It’s absolutely phenomenal; this is hands down one of my favorite designs of all time,” he said. “It makes a difference too when it’s for your brother and future sister-in-law; it’s their very first home together. It means a lot and that’s why I wanted to make sure we get it right.”

In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.
But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.","A painting by famed 18th century Mexican artist Miguel Cabrera – long believed lost to history - may have been hanging in obscurity on the wall of a Los Angeles home for the last 60 years.

The artwork, nicknamed “Española,” is the only missing piece from the 16 Cabrera did in a series of casta, or caste, paintings. The painting's location remained a mystery for decades, until two years ago, when Ilona Katzew, the curator of Latin American art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, received a cryptic letter written in the voice of the little girl featured in the artwork.

“You should know that I am well and living less than two (2) miles from LACMA,” Española wrote in the letter to Katzew, the Los Angeles Times reported. “I have been in the same family for I believe 60 years, although I do not know how I was acquired.”

Since opening the letter, Katzew has puzzled over where in that two mile radius “Española” is hiding, but clues to the painting’s whereabouts are few and far between.

The three-paragraph letter gave no more indication of the painting’s location or means of contacting the owner. The mailing label was trimmed down to remove any information about its origin. The postage was a pair of 37-cent stamps – retired a decade before the letter was sent – and a commemorative stamp honoring writer Jack London that was issued in 1988.

Five photos of the painting – the only ones known to exist of the work - were also included with the letter, but the only information that Katzew was able to glean from them was that the artwork was in a modern frame and that it was apparently hanging high on a wall.

In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.

“If you ever gather a reunion of all my siblings, I would welcome the opportunity to be on display for a limited period of time,” the letter noted. “I am not lost, I just do not wish to be found.”

The 16 paintings in Cabrera’s casta series – an art style that explored interracial marriages and children in the Spain’s New World colonies – were purportedly sent to Spain from Mexico shortly after the artist’s death and displayed in the home of the Viceroy of New Spain, Joaquin de Montserrat.

In 2015, 14 of the painting were housed in museums across the U.S., Spain and Mexico. The most recently discovered one – a painting of a Spanish father, his half-Spanish, half-African wife, and their albino baby – was found under a couch in a northern California home and quickly obtained by LACMA.

“My owner has enjoyed seeing #6,” Española’s letter said in reference to the most recently acquired painting, “and I am pleased that we are all now accounted for despite the diaspora.”

But it’s been two years since the most recent Cabrera was acquired – and since Española’s letter – and Katzew hasn’t had any other contact with the painting’s owner. But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.",Cryptic letter taunts museum curator looking for missing masterpiece,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/cryptic-letter-taunts-museum-curator-looking-for-missing-masterpiece.html

The researchers believe the phytochemicals in mango pulp were responsible for the better response on constipation, as well as inflammatory markers.
FlaxseedsKnown as one of the best ways to improve digestive health or relieve constipation, flaxseeds are a good source of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.
Decreased inflammation in the digestive tract means less stress on the bowel, which can help decrease constipation.
Plus, pears are high in pectin, a form of fiber that is particularly helpful for constipation.","Most of us experience constipation once in a while. Not only is it uncomfortable, the condition can also cause irritability, fatigue and bloating. If you suffer from constipation more than occasionally, or the problem includes severe pain or bleeding, check with your doctor to see if something more serious is going on. While there are several causes for constipation, what you eat (lots of fiber!) and drink (lots of water!) can help get things moving. In addition to drinking plenty of water, which will help make your bowel movements softer and easier to pass, here are five foods to add to your grocery list for a happier pit stop.

Mangos

The most popular fruit in the world, mangos are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, as well as fiber to aid digestion. But it might be more than the fiber in mangos that helps get things moving. A recent study conducted at Texas A&M University found that people with chronic constipation supplemented with a mango supplement (the equivalent of one medium-sized mango a day) showed a more significant reduction in constipation in a four-week period compared to people receiving a non-mango fiber supplement. The researchers believe the phytochemicals in mango pulp were responsible for the better response on constipation, as well as inflammatory markers.

Flaxseeds

Known as one of the best ways to improve digestive health or relieve constipation, flaxseeds are a good source of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. In one small study, 55 people with constipation caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) found that those who took flaxseeds not only reduced constipation but also showed a reduction in abdominal pain and bloating as compared to those who used psyllium (a fiber supplement). Like all sources of fiber, drink lots of water when consuming flaxseed and if you choose to include them in your diet, gradually work your way up to 2 tablespoons per day. Since our bodies can’t break down the whole seed, grind them (you can use a coffee grinder) directly before adding them to your food to get the most nutrients.

Broccoli

A powerhouse of nutrients, broccoli also contains fiber for digestive health. In addition, broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables contain an antioxidant called sulforaphane, which has been shown to lower the risk of chronic inflammation and help protect the lining of the stomach from bacterial overgrowth. Decreased inflammation in the digestive tract means less stress on the bowel, which can help decrease constipation.

Yogurt

Yogurt contains tens of millions of live beneficial bacteria called probiotics. Probiotics promote a healthy gut while decreasing inflammation. A research review of 14 studies published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that on average, probiotics slowed “gut transit time” by 12.4 hours, increased the number of weekly bowel movements by 1.3, and helped soften stools, making them easier to pass. You can also get probiotics in fermented foods like Kefir, sauerkraut and kimchi.

Pears

If you’re feeling constipated and bloated, you’re going to want to keep the skin on these sweet treats. The skin of the pear has been shown to have about half of the pear’s total fiber. The skin of the pear also contains three to four times as many antioxidants and anti-inflammatory flavonoids as the flesh of the pear alone. Plus, pears are high in pectin, a form of fiber that is particularly helpful for constipation.",5 foods that help relieve constipation,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/27/5-foods-that-help-relieve-constipation.html

Halperin said he went to counseling to work on his issues and he did not engage in the same behavior while he was employed at Time, Bloomberg, NBC News and Showtime.

MARK HALPERIN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY TWO MORE WOMEN

Halperin’s apology was released near the time CNN, which first published a report Wednesday detailing the sexual harassment allegations, came out with another article of four more women coming forward with new accusations, The Washington Post reported.

CNN reported one woman claimed Halperin masturbated in front of her while another woman said the “Game Change” co-author threw her against a restaurant window and threatened to derail her career after she rebuffed him.

Some of the allegations against him claim that, while working at ABC News, he grabbed a woman’s breasts without consent and pressed his clothed and erect penis against three of his co-workers.

Several employees suggested that his behavior was common knowledge, including former ABC correspondent Clarissa Ward who described it as “an open secret.”

Following the allegations, Penguin Press canceled a planned book by Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2016 election and HBO called off a miniseries that would have been based on the book. Halperin and Heilemann had collaborated on two previous books, including ""Game Change,"" a best-seller about the 2008 race that almost single-handedly revived the campaign book genre and was the basis for an award-winning HBO adaptation.

A Kansas bus driver makes it her highest priority to boost the morale of the students she picks up and drops off every day.

Jan Dumcum, of Goddard, Kan., has been driving the bus in the school district for five years, KAKE reported. Dumcum’s bus, similar to many other yellow school buses on the outside, has a totally different atmosphere once you step inside.

Dumcum decorates her bus to match the holiday. She told KAKE her vehicle is festive to make students feel “good about themselves.”

“Everything that is up here has a purpose. I want them (the students) to feel good about themselves. I want them to feel like they can do anything,” Dumcum told KAKE.

Dumcum also keeps a bell by the door that the students ring to remind her they were going to have a “good day.”

""I decided they would announce they were going to have a good day by ringing the bell and in the evening when they rang the bell, they had a good day,"" the bus driver said.

Dumcum said the safety of the children was her main priority but was cautious of the drivers who fail to stop behind the bus.

""There are people on that street that can't give me three minutes to get my kids safely and that's very frustrating,"" the driver said.

The bus, which is currently decorated for Halloween, will also be adorned for Christmas. KAKE said the bus would be embellished with lights to help students get into the holiday spirit.

In a story by the New Yorker, actress Annabella Sciorra claims that Weinstein “violently raped” her, and actress Daryl Hannah says her career suffered after encounters with Weinstein.

In the early 1990s, Sciorra alleged that after dropping her off from a party, Weinstein went uninvited into her apartment and proceeded to start undressing himself as he walked around.

“He shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me. I kicked and I yelled,” she said. Weinstein reportedly then held her arms up and forced her to have sex with him.

“When he was done, he ejaculated on my leg, and on my nightgown. He said, ‘I have impeccable timing,’ and then he said, ‘This is for you,’” she told the magazine.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN SEX SCANDAL: DETAILING THE ALLEGATIONS

“And then he attempted to perform oral sex on me. And I struggled, but I had very little strength left in me.”

Weinstein eventually left her after she began compulsively shaking, she said.

Sciorra told the New Yorker that she never told anyone what happened, including the police, saying that she felt “so ashamed” and “disgusting.”

In 1997, Sciorra recalled another encounter with Weinstein during which they had neighboring hotel rooms. She said he knocked on her door early one morning and she opened it without thinking.

“There’s Harvey in his underwear, holding a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a tape, a movie, in the other,” she said. “And it was horrific, because I'd been there before.”

Sciorra, 57, has had film roles in ""Jungle Fever"" and ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"" and also appeared on HBO's ""The Sopranos.""

ROSE MCGOWAN TO MAKE FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE SINCE WEINSTEIN ACCUSATIONS

Hannah said that when she first met Weinstein, she didn’t know about his reputation. So when he asked her hotel room number to schedule a meeting, she didn’t think much of it.

Later she heard “incessant” knocking on her hotel room door. She said she got so scared she eventually snuck out the back.

The following day, the knocking began again, the report said.

“The knocking started again and again. And I was like, ‘oh s---,’ ” Hannah recalled. “We actually pushed a dresser in front of the door and just kind of huddled in the room.”

HARVEY WEINSTEIN ACCUSED OF RAPE BY ACTRESS NATASSIA MALTHE

Several years later, Hannah allegedly encountered Weinstein again when he somehow got a key to her hotel room and let himself in.

“He came through the living room and into the bedroom. He just burst in like a raging bull,” she told the New Yorker. “And I know with every fiber of my being that if my male makeup artist was not in that room, things would not have gone well. It was scary.”

Weinstein reportedly tried to get her to leave and go to a party with him downstairs. When she eventually got dressed, she said the party room was “completely empty.”

As a result of her encounters, Hannah told the New Yorker that her career suffered substantially. And when she told people what happened, it didn’t help.

“I did tell people about it,” she said. “And it didn’t matter.”

Hannah, 56, has had roles in ""Blade Runner, ""Wall Street,"" and ""Steel Magnolias.""",New Harvey Weinstein sexual assault accusations emerge,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/27/new-harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-accusations-emerge.html

That is the first Halloween I remember the hum of petrified parents. It was the first time we didn’t get to go trick or treating, no not even one street over. Instead, we had a makeshift party at a neighbor’s house. The TV news turned on low warned of tainted Tylenol.

The next year was the first time we took our candy to the police station to be X-rayed to check for needles and razor blades. We heard the adults whisper: “What is the world coming to?”

We didn’t know, but I thought as police checked out my candy: “Easy with that full-size Snickers you’re manhandling!”

As an adult with children ranging in age from 3 to 22, I have seen just about everything in the ways of Halloween. From the politically incorrect to the religiously correct to the “yeah, just give us some freaking candy,” everyone has an opinion.

And every year there is some new rule or renegade rant about all the souls that have come and gone, and may or may not stop by for some creepy punch served over dry ice. Dry ice, by the way, is very dangerous when handled with bare hands.

As I watched volunteers wander into the haunted house at my daughter’s school, I noted that 35 years ago those costumes would have sent me to counseling. My husband whimpered and covered the eyes of our 5-year-old as a cheerleader with high-def cosmetics entered, carrying what was supposed to be her own head under one arm.

Everything is more terrifying now, in make-believe and in real life.

In real life, gunmen take people out with high-powered rifles at concerts, and bad guys put poison and needles in caramel apples. But that is the minority. I refuse to believe it is the majority or the rule.

In the infamous words of Linus in Charles Schultz’s “The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown”:

“There are three things I've learned never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin.”

When it comes to Halloween, there are some who will lock themselves away in fear of what might happen, or to nurse their wounds because of what did happen. There are some who lock themselves away in protest.

There are others who call it something else, like a fest or a carnival so as not to offend or beckon souls. Still, others will go too far, making some crude political statement or dressing their toddler like a French maid or Monica Lewinsky.

And in this game called Halloween, all that is necessary for us to have something for us to talk about next year. Some grand opinion, some horrific worry, some hill to die on, or some great offense that rocks us to our core and gets us out of bed to write that letter, so that we might be heard.

I find myself wishing I was sitting in a pumpkin patch with Linus, a sheet over my head, never mind the thread count, two holes cut out for eyes. I make no statement with this sheet. I courageously eat unwrapped Rice Krispies that the neighbor dropped in my bucket. I don’t care how she voted in the last election. I wait patiently for something magical to happen, less publicized and political than Santa.

There’s no way that I can make any accusations against Mr. Mueller because he is a man of high ethical standards,” Grassley told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday.
SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT SPECIAL COUNSEL FROM FIRINGComey’s attorney, David Kelley, also has disputed the characterizations of the Mueller-Comey relationship interviews in the past.","Special Counsel Robert Mueller is facing a fresh round of calls from conservative critics for his resignation from the Russia collusion probe, amid revelations that have called into question the FBI’s own actions and potentially Mueller’s independence.

This week’s bombshell that a controversial anti-Trump dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign has Republicans asking to what extent the FBI – which received some of the findings and briefly agreed to pay the same researcher to gather intelligence on Trump and Russia – used the politically connected material.

Hill investigators also are looking into a Russian firm’s uranium deal that was approved by the Obama administration in 2010 despite reports that the FBI – then led by Mueller – had evidence of bribery involving a subsidiary of that firm.

Critics question whether Mueller’s own ties to the bureau as well as fired FBI director James Comey now render him compromised as he investigates allegations of Russian meddling and collusion with Trump officials in the 2016 race.

“The federal code could not be clearer – Mueller is compromised by his apparent conflict of interest in being close with James Comey,” Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who first called for Mueller to step down over the summer, said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. “The appearance of a conflict is enough to put Mueller in violation of the code. … All of the revelations in recent weeks make the case stronger.”

Outgoing New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor and Trump ally, also suggested Friday that Mueller consider stepping aside.

“If the facts that you just laid out are true, then somebody with Bob Mueller’s integrity will step aside and should -- if in fact those facts, as you laid them out, are true,” Christie said on “Fox & Friends,” in response to various conflict-of-interest allegations.

The special counsel’s office declined Fox News’ request for comment.

This is not the first time Mueller has faced calls to step down.

Congressional Republicans over the summer raised concerns over Mueller’s relationship with Comey, whom Trump ousted from the FBI in May. Reps. Franks and Andy Biggs, both Republicans from Arizona, had called for Mueller’s resignation for that reason.

President Trump has called Mueller’s relationship with Comey “bothersome,” though hasn’t said much about Mueller’s role lately even as he seizes on the latest revelations about the Fusion GPS dossier to try and turn the tables on Democrats in the Russia scandal.

“It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!” he tweeted Friday.

But the Wall Street Journal editorial board cited the dossier development in calling for Mueller’s resignation on Thursday, saying the “troubling question is whether the FBI played a role” in aiding a “Russian disinformation campaign.”

“Two pertinent questions: Did the dossier trigger the FBI probe of the Trump campaign, and did Mr. Comey or his agents use it as evidence to seek wiretapping approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Trump campaign aides?” the editorial board wrote, before turning to Mueller's role:

“The Fusion news means the FBI’s role in Russia’s election interference must now be investigated—even as the FBI and Justice insist that Mr. Mueller’s probe prevents them from cooperating with Congressional investigators. Mr. Mueller is a former FBI director, and for years he worked closely with Mr. Comey. It is no slur against Mr. Mueller’s integrity to say that he lacks the critical distance to conduct a credible probe of the bureau he ran for a dozen years. He could best serve the country by resigning to prevent further political turmoil over that conflict of interest.”

Another potential issue is Mueller’s supervision of a bribery probe involving a subsidiary of Russia’s Rosatom, which eventually got approval from the U.S. to buy a Canadian mining company that controlled a swath of American uranium reserves. At the time of the probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel, was a U.S. attorney and Mueller was FBI director. Republicans want to know how that deal was approved despite the evidence gathered in the bribery probe.

“The whole reason for independent counsels is to have the public trust, the professionalism and the diligence of the investigation, but they have to guard against actual conflicts of interest and apparent conflicts of interest,” said former high-ranking Justice Department official James Trusty, who served under the Bush and Obama administrations. “There may be some tipping point, though, separating facts from rumors, and we may be close to the tipping point.”

Earlier this week, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called for a separate special counsel to investigate the Uranium One deal.

GRASSLEY CALLS FOR SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE URANIUM ONE DEAL

Grassley, however, stopped short of suggesting he didn’t trust Mueller.

“There might be reasons to wonder his involvement because of his involvement with the previous administration during this period of time. There’s no way that I can make any accusations against Mr. Mueller because he is a man of high ethical standards,” Grassley told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday.

Other Republicans have sought to protect Mueller from interference.

There are currently two pieces of legislation in the Senate, with bipartisan sponsorship, that would ensure a judicial check on the executive branch’s ability to remove a special counsel. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., are behind the bills, along with Democratic senators.

SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT SPECIAL COUNSEL FROM FIRING

Comey’s attorney, David Kelley, also has disputed the characterizations of the Mueller-Comey relationship interviews in the past.

“Bob and Jim have a congenial relationship as former colleagues. Both served long legal careers that involved overlapping time spent within the Department of Justice, and that’s pretty well documented. But beyond that, they’re not close, personal friends,” Kelley told the Washington Post this summer. “They’re friends in the sense that co-workers are friends. They don’t really have a personal relationship.”

Kelley told Fox News on Friday that he stands by those comments.

Mueller, meanwhile, has been criticized by Republicans for the makeup of his investigative team, which includes several Democratic donors.

“As these various Russian related allegations swirl, I think Mueller increasingly regrets his decision to pick a staff in which half of the prosecutors had either given to, or participated, in Democratic causes,” Trusty said. “That was an unforced error.”",Mueller facing new Republican pressure to resign in Russia probe,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/27/mueller-facing-new-republican-pressure-to-resign-in-russia-probe.html

According to the Associated Press, 59-year-old Wei-Ming Shi plead guilty to simple assault on an aircraft during flight Monday. However, Shi could be sentenced to up to six months in jail and probation when he appears in front of a federal judge in March.

Shi's original charges carried a total of up to five years behind bars.

While the man's attorney claims the Pennsylvania native believed the victim, who is in her 20s, was ""flirting"" with him prior to falling asleep on the August 18, 2016, flight, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Kaufman refuted the notion, saying the woman was simply being friendly toward her fellow passenger.

The victim said she fell asleep on the flight and was later awoke by Shi when he reached under her dress to touch her thigh, buttocks and lower back.

""She was not flirting by any means,"" said Kaufman.

U.S. District Judge John Walton said Shi displayed ""repulsive behavior,"" according to the AP.

Several passengers have reported incidents of unwanted touching, with some victims even filing complaints against airlines for failing to respond appropriately.

This past summer, United Airlines came under fire after a teenager flying solo from Seattle to Newark awoke to find another passenger groping her. The girl and her family were critical of the carrier and alleged it violated its own policy by failing to alert authorities.

Similarly disturbing incidents have been handled much more effectively by other airlines.

X-ray technology was used to reveal the ghostly unfinished portrait of the Scottish Queen, who reigned from 1542 to 1567. Convicted of treason against Queen Elizabeth I of England, she was beheaded at Fotheringay Castle in England in 1587.

Mary’s portrait was painted over with a portrait of Sir John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane. The 1589 painting of Maitland, who was Lord Chancellor of Scotland, has been attributed to the Dutch artist Adrian Vanson.

LONG-LOST DARK AGE KINGDOM DISCOVERED IN SOUTHERN SCOTLAND

Mary’s hidden portrait was discovered by Dr. Caroline Rae, a research fellow at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Working with National Galleries of Scotland, Rae examined the painting using x-ray technology, which penetrates layers of paint but does not penetrate pigments containing heavy metals such as lead white, a white pigment that was used in paintings of that time.

The x-ray reveals the shadowy outline of a woman, who experts believe is Mary, Queen of Scots, based on other depictions of the controversial queen.

After abdicating the Scottish throne amid suspicions that she was implicated in her husband’s murder, Mary was imprisoned from 1568 until her death by her cousin Elizabeth I, who perceived her as a threat.

RARE ROMAN COIN DISCOVERED ON REMOTE SCOTTISH ISLAND

In a statement, Rae described the discovery of the hidden portrait as an “exciting revelation.”

Vanson’s portrait of Sir John Maitland usually hangs in Ham House, near London, but is part of a new display that opens Oct. 28 at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.

The fact that Mary’s portrait was painted over with a portrait of Sir John Maitland just two years after her execution may reflect someone’s desire to distance themselves from the Scottish queen.

TEENAGER'S DISCOVERY OF ROMAN TREASURE TROVE DELIGHTS EXPERTS

“Vanson’s portrait of Sir John Maitland is an important picture in the National Trust collection, and the remarkable discovery of the unfinished portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots adds an exciting hidden dimension to it,” said David Taylor, curator of pictures and sculpture at the National Trust, which owns Ham House. “It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing.”

The portrait discovery is just the latest fascinating find to shed new light on Scotland’s rich history. Earlier this year, for example, experts announced the discovery of a rare Roman coin on a remote island in the Orkney archipelago. Archaeologists and volunteers also found the location of a long-lost early medieval kingdom in southern Scotland.

In 2014, a stunning hoard of ancient silver, believed to have been used as bribes by Romans, was discovered with a metal detector by a teenager in Dairsie, in the Scottish region of Fife.

The celebrity chef and host of CNN’s “Parts Unknown” has often come under fire for his sharp tongue, witty comments, and statements that, let’s just say, make him less of a people pleaser. Which is also why so many people adore him.

Now, however, Bourdain’s actions may be catching up with him, as Buzzfeed reported the chef is now banned from ever entering the country of Azerbaijan again.

According to the Washington Post, Bourdain’s crime was entering a hotly contested territory of the country known as Nagorno-Karabakh. The region tried to succeed from Azerbaijan in 1988 in an attempt to join Armenia instead. However, Azerbaijan rejected the attempt and the region has been embroiled in conflict ever since.

Because the relationship between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh is fragile at best, someone traveling between the two areas needs special permission to do so. In fact, as the Post noted, visiting without permission from the government is considered a criminal offense.

“Without the explicit consent of and a visa issued by the authorities of the Republic of Azerbaijan, a person, who made/makes a trip to the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan, will not be granted a visa to the Republic of Azerbaijan and will be deported in case of his/her future entrance,” the website for the Azerbaijani embassy states.

Currently the government holds a list containing more than 700 names of people banned from both regions because they entered Nagorno-Karabakh without permission. That list includes government officials, activists, journalists, and now, Bourdain.

Bourdain “has been put onto the persona non grata list for his disrespect of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and sovereignty,” according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Hikmet Hajiyev, who spoke with Agence France-Presse. Hajiyev added, “Filming a food show on Azerbaijan's occupied territory is an insult to 1 million Azerbaijani refugees who were forcefully expelled from their homes.”

In fact, they may not even have windows and instead seal military personnel inside a closed cockpit to better protect them against threats.

But how could they see the battlefield around them without windows? To see outside, Soldiers could use a new technology made by Honeywell that lets them “see” with virtual reality and augmented reality.

Using a headset and a wraparound display, drivers are given the effect of “seeing” beyond the armor to the war zone around them. The augmented reality even enhances their “sight” by overlaying crucial information like enemy movements and safe routes ahead.

This remarkable advance is part of the DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) initiative that could lead to an entirely new era of tanks and armored combat vehicles. GXV-T would offer tank-like protection on a vehicle that resembles a futuristic All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) but is smaller than a traditional tank.

SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR

DARPA awarded eight contracts to work on the exciting, groundbreaking GXV-T. Honeywell is one of these companies.

Recently, Honeywell successfully tested this window-free tech on a tough, off-road desert course at speeds of more than 35mph. The drivers successfully maneuvered the course from inside the closed cockpit relying on the “sight” provided by the virtual reality system.

Unsurprisingly, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are already interested in DARPA’s vision for this radical new vehicle. The GXV-T would provide the U.S. military with enormous advantages over adversaries.

Far Better Armor

The big advantage to no windows? Keep US military personnel inside a whole lot safer.

Another research thrust for DARPA on the GXV-T project is radically overhauling the approach to armor. For more than a century, the approach has been more armor equals more protection.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

There are, however, tradeoffs to more armor, such as adding more weight, which means less speed and agility. These capabilities can be essential in some scenarios so finding the right balance between the armor trade-offs is never easy.

But with GXV-T, the goal is a closed cockpit that allows reactive armor to enhance safety on the outside. Reactive armor detects threats and reacts. So, for example, when it anticipates the impact of a threat like an RPG, this armor would be able to shift and concentrate in the area it will impact.

Without the windows, it may be possible to do far more with less armor and still offer far better protection.

How does it work?

Honeywell harnessed its experience with aircraft cockpits and applied it to creating a GXV-T “cockpit.”

Cameras and sensors fixed on the vehicle feed data to onboard computers. These stitch together the data into one cohesive image and the wraparound internal screens display this imagery.

WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?

The operator dons the special virtual and augmented reality headset and when that is combined with the panoramic screen it creates the effect of “seeing” outside the vehicle – whilst safely inside a closed cockpit.

Already, Honeywell’s virtual landscape allows an operator to off-road at realistic speeds. This set of initial tests were conducted with 160-degree views. DARPA’s aim is for a 360-degree view and although it may seem impossible, it may be possible to achieve that.

Motion sickness and eye strain are two common complaints and tough challenges for companies working to advance virtual reality. Honeywell seems to have cracked these pesky problems because the feedback thus far has been very positive with drivers not suffering from either complaint.

Augmented Reality View

Safety and protection is paramount, but another key advantage to this revolutionary approach is providing operators with enhanced “sight.” With augmented reality, operators can have crucial data overlaid as well.

Already, Honeywell has been able to build in speed, heading, and position data augmentation. But lots of further symbols could be added to further assist driver’s during their missions.

Enemy movements, the best routes to avoid detection, upcoming difficult terrain, threat detection – these are just a few examples of useful data that could augment what a driver “sees.” Enhanced situational awareness will also improve safety for personnel.

In many ways, this is very similar to the data displayed in U.S. fighter pilots’ cockpits, but would now be available to ground forces in closed cockpits.

PODCAST: LEARN HOW TO FLY A FIGHTER JET WITH A FASCINATING FIGHTER PILOT

What is GXV-T?

DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) is advancing tech for combat in many ways. Overall, the goal is to produce smarter, faster and more agile vehicles for the future force.

Another area that will increase protection, for example, is the progress being made to develop the GXV-T as ultra-stealthy.

ATHENA LASER WEAPON 'KILLS' 5 'OUTLAWS'

Tanks are not exactly known for being stealthy. But imagine if the military could have a vehicle with tank protection, but fighter jet stealth? Advances are being made in tech for the GXV-T to evade detection by the enemy from acoustic and electromagnetic methods through to infrared.

A new kind of driving

For the military, these kinds of big breakthroughs could pave the way to the future force taking tanks into battle that have remarkable advantages like this virtual and augmented reality and futuristic reactive armor. This would turn them into much lighter and far more agile vehicles, while providing even more protection for U.S. troops.

But there is also potential for significant impact in the civilian world. Honeywell’s achievement could help pave the way to a future where civilians take advantage of the enhanced safety closed cockpits could offer and drive windowless as well. Or windshields could become transformed into displays that offer augmented reality, suggesting optimal routes to avoid traffic so drivers will never have to look down at their phones for Waze again.",Powerful tiny tanks with VR and futuristic cockpits could revolutionize the battlefield,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/26/powerful-tiny-tanks-with-vr-and-futuristic-cockpits-could-revolutionize-battlefield.html

Setting out in March 2016 against wild weather, critics, and the odds alike, the spry outdoorsman made his final step of the journey on Oct. 26 — and officially became the oldest hiker to thru-hike the trail.

“I feel numb right now. It’s really a euphoric experience,” Sanders said, according to Outside magazine. “I’m just so thankful to the people who have helped me. I literally would not be here if it weren’t for all the people who encouraged me along the way.”

FAMILY BRINGS BABY ON APPALACHIAN TRAIL HIKE, SETS HER UP TO BE YOUNGEST TO EVER COMPLETE THE JOURNEY

Affectionately nicknamed “Greybeard,"" Sanders broke Lee Barry’s record, who completed the hike at age 81 in 2004. Taking a “flip-flop” approach to the trail, Sanders traveled from Georgia to West Virginia, before going north to Maine and back again to the Mountain State. This popular adjustment allows hikers to trek in fairer weather conditions before tackling the northernmost part of the A.T.

According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, 2,650 adventurers set out each year to hike the A.T. in its totality, but Sanders’ journey in particular is remarkable from the start. For starters, he is older than the trail itself, as it was officially christened in 1937, the Washington Post notes. And while on the trail, he even met young Elie Quirin, who is poised to become A.T.'s youngest-ever hiker to date.

While Sanders has much to celebrate now, the experience came with its fair share of scares. In August, his journey nearly ended when he began internally bleeding in Maine’s Hundred-Mile Wilderness, heading home to Tennessee for ten days to be treated for a ruptured hemorrhoid.

Sanders said that the episode stole his confidence and he “almost didn’t come back” until a friend convinced him to return, and even accompanying back to the trail. Though Sanders had never hiked for more than two weeks before setting out for the A.T., it was not his first serious outdoor escapade.

In his youth, Sanders broke the record for underwater-breath-holding in 1959, and was IUSA spearfishing athlete of the year in 1965, the Washington Post notes. A Navy veteran and lifelong parks and recreation professional, at age 80, he paddled the entire Mississippi River in support of juvenile diabetes research.

Repeatedly citing how critical the support of fellow hikers, or “trail angels,” was to his achieving his dream, Sanders reports that it was all worth it.

“The best comment from one of them was, ‘I want to be like you when I’m your age.’ That kept me going,” he said.","82-year-old finishes Appalachian Trail, becomes oldest to ever complete hike",http://www.foxnews.com/great-outdoors/2017/10/27/82-year-old-finishes-appalachian-trail-becomes-oldest-to-ever-complete-hike.html

Sexual harassment occurs when one person chooses to sexually objectify another person. And in a tweet, DeGeneres shared a photo of herself and singer Katy Perry with DeGeneres’ jaw wide open and gawking directly at Perry's breasts. To complete the hypocritical gesture, DeGeneres included this caption:

“Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!”

The real question now is how would DeGeneres have responded if it were a man who did exactly what she did – taking a photo posing with his jaw wide open and head gawking into the breasts of another woman?

How would DeGeneres react if it were a man making the same comments, calling a woman’s breasts “big balloons?” She would no doubt be one of the first people to publicly condemn such an action as being sexist and harassment.

“This is not a male thing or a female thing, it is not a Hollywood thing or a political thing, this is a human thing and it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world and we are all the same,” she said on her TV show in a monologue discussing sexual harassment. “We all want the same thing, we want respect, love and kindness. And if I could have those three things and an iPhone X, I would be complete.”

So how does DeGeneres justify her sexist action?

Is it because she's a woman and she thinks that it's okay for one woman to objectify another woman's body?

Is it because DeGeneres believes that since she is a lesbian she can objectify or make sexual comments about another woman's body?

If you are going to be a social justice warrior Ellen, then you must also be the example. You cannot just bandy words around and argue against sexual harassment, calling for love, respect and kindness for all humans when you are actually the one engaging in the very thing you condemn.

It is exactly these sorts of behaviors that lead the general public to become so exhausted and disgusted by the hypocrisy of Hollywood.

Ellen, don't use an anti-sexual harassment campaign to build yourself up or to widen your audience or to gain more ratings. Do it because you believe in it. And if you believe in it then maintain your integrity and be consistent in your actions. At the very least, you could own up to your sexist actions, apologize and learn from your own mistakes.",Ellen DeGeneres proves she’s a hypocrite with sexist tweet of herself staring at Katy Perry’s breasts,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/ellen-degeneres-proves-s-hypocrite-with-sexist-tweet-herself-staring-at-katy-perry-s-breasts.html

But now many of those admirers may be wondering who the real clown is.

After receiving backlash over a 2000 memoir that details his past behavior toward women, Taibbi now says the book was a fictional “satire.”

Taibbi abruptly canceled his scheduled appearance at a humanities festival in Chicago on Saturday after negative reaction to an interview he recently gave to an NPR reporter.

According to Reuters, NPR asked Taibbi about the memoir he co-authored, called “The Exile: Sex, Drugs and Libel in the New Russia.”

The book details the exploits of Taibbi, 47, and another staffer while they worked for an English-language newspaper in Russia.

The memoir includes anecdotes in which Taibbi and co-author Mark Ames seem to have mistreated – possibly even assaulted – some women they encountered in Russia, Reuters reported.

According to an excerpt published by the Chicago Reader, Taibbi and Ames refer to attractive Russian women as being “usually available to the highest bidder,” and often willing to engage in “condomless sex.”

But in a Facebook post last week, Taibbi wrote that the memoir was really fictional and that his intent was to poke fun at the idea of Americans living in Russia.

“I regret many editorial decisions that I made back then, and putting my name as a co-author on a book that used cruel and misogynistic language to describe many people and women in particular,” Taibbi wrote. “I hope readers can forgive my poor judgment at that time.”

Co-author Ames also posted that the book was fictional.

“I never raped, harassed, assaulted anyone, and it sickens me that I’m dragged into having to make this sort of denial,” Ames wrote, according to Reuters.

The Chicago Reader’s Aimee Levitt, however, notes that Twitter users have pointed out that the book contains a note at the beginning, saying it was nonfictional.

“To fail to acknowledge Taibbi's earlier work is to say that what he and Ames wrote about doing didn't matter, how those women felt didn't matter, and, by extension, to say we don't matter, and you, our female readers, don't matter,” Levitt writes. “But we do.

It was Palm Sunday, April 4, 2004. The U.S. military calls it ""Black Sunday."" A small platoon of soldiers with the 1st Cavalry Division out of Fort Hood, Texas, was ambushed in the Baghdad suburb of Sadr City. The soldiers, many of them young and inexperienced, were on a peacekeeping mission and weren't expected to face heavy combat.

As the investigation heats up and key players like former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and press secretary Sean Spicer are interviewed by investigators, several attorneys with experience in federal cases spoke out with their concerns this week.

Harvey Silverglate, a criminal defense attorney in Massachusetts, wrote an opinion piece accusing Mueller of once trying to entrap him when Mueller was acting U.S. attorney in Boston.

“I have known Mueller during key moments of his career as a federal prosecutor,” Silverglate wrote for WGBH News. “My experience has taught me to approach whatever he does in the Trump investigation with a requisite degree of skepticism or, at the very least, extreme caution.”

According to Silverglate, Mueller once sent someone into Silverglate's office offering to give false testimony for a client. Silverglate said he turned the offer down and noticed the man was wearing a wire.

“Years later I ran into Mueller, and I told him of my disappointment in being the target of a sting where there was no reason to think that I would knowingly present perjured evidence to a court,” Silverglate wrote. “Mueller, half-apologetically, told me that he never really thought that I would suborn perjury, but that he had a duty to pursue the lead given to him.”

A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment.

Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor, also took aim at Andrew Weissmann, the prosecutor tapped by Mueller to help lead the investigation, in a piece this week titled, “Judging by Mueller's staffing choices, he may not be very interested in justice.”

Powell accused Weissmann, once the director of the Enron Task Force, of “prosecutorial overreach” in past cases and said it could signal what’s to come for President Trump and his associates in the Russia probe.

“What was supposed to have been a search for Russia’s cyberspace intrusions into our electoral politics has morphed into a malevolent mission targeting friends, family and colleagues of the president,” Powell wrote in The Hill. “The Mueller investigation has become an all-out assault to find crimes to pin on them — and it won’t matter if there are no crimes to be found. This team can make some.”

Powell cited several cases where Weissmann won convictions that were later overturned.

Powell, who also spoke to Fox News last month, was so outraged after one case involving Weissmann that, in 2012, she filed a formal complaint of prosecutorial misconduct with the Texas bar and the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility.

The complaint alleged witness threatening, withholding exculpatory evidence, and the use of “false and misleading summaries.” After reviewing the complaint, the Obama administration’s OPR found no ethical violations.

MUELLER TEAM UNDER FIRE FOR ‘BRASS-KNUCKLE’ TACTICS IN BID TO SQUEEZE MANAFORT

In her op-ed, Powell criticized Weissmann over the FBI’s raid of the home of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman.

“Mueller’s rare, predawn raid of Manafort’s home — a fearsome treat usually reserved for mobsters and drug dealers — is textbook Weissmann terrorism,” she wrote.

While Mueller’s team is facing scrutiny for its tactics and handling of past cases, federal scrutiny of Manafort predates the Mueller investigation. He had been investigated by the feds due to his past dealings in Ukraine, for which he didn’t file as a foreign agent until June 2017. Mueller later incorporated that investigation into his Russia probe.

A recent NBC News report also claimed Manafort has stronger ties to a powerful Russian oligarch than previously known.

The intensity of the current focus on Manafort was widely seen as a potential effort by Mueller’s team to pressure him into providing information on others, possibly Trump himself, in the Russia probe.

Feldman has alleged in the past that Haim was raped at age 11 by a powerful person in Hollywood and the experience led to Haim's drug addiction issues. Feldman’s pal and “Lost Boys” costar died in 2010 at 38 from pneumonia.

Now, Feldman wants to produce a self-distributed film about the pedophiles he says are still plaguing Hollywood.

“I believe we can… bring down potentially a pedophile ring that I have been aware of since I was a child. Right off the bat I can name six names,” he said in a video posted on Wednesday in which he announced the film and requested funding from his fans.

Feldman claimed he survived a “near-death experience” after two trucks tried to run him over — all because he's working to expose pedophiles in Hollywood, he said. In the video, Feldman said his physical safety is in danger.

He shared an Indiegogo campaign to fund his planned documentary.

As of this writing, Feldman’s Indiegogo campaign has raised more than $99,000 of its flexible goal of $10,000. According to the site, a “flexible goal” means Feldman will keep all the money raised, even if the goal is not met.

“Ever since I discussed the fact that I have this plan, my life has turned to utter chaos,” he says in the nearly seven-minute video below.

“I’ve been silenced my whole life, but just over the past few days since I made that announcement, I’ve been arrested, I had a near-death experience last night where I felt like I was almost going to be killed. Two trucks came speeding at me at the same time on a crosswalk.”

Feldman’s wife, Courtney, wrote on the Indiegogo campaign page that the money is for their security and that he’s taken measures to ensure his secrets can outlive him.

“This is much bigger than raising finance for a film, this is about the balance of Good and Evil in very real terms,” she wrote.

“Firstly as a security measure Corey has already written down the names and details of the events and given them to a trusted person of power, in case anything should happen to him or any member of his family before the film is finished,” she warns.

The news comes on the heels of the now infamous scandal surrounding disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein. However, if Feldman is able to prove his allegations are true, it could expose a much deeper criminal conspiracy, he insists.

“I propose to do this by... telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,” he says.

“I will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations. Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family.”","Corey Feldman says his life is in danger because he wants to expose 'pedophile ring' that abused him, Corey Haim",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/26/corey-feldman-says-his-life-is-in-danger-because-wants-to-expose-pedophile-ring-that-abused-him-corey-haim.html

“The worst comments have to be the ones along the lines of, ‘No more baby in that belly,’ or ‘Start eating more so your baby can grow,’” she said.

Kousoukas has a medical condition that causes her uterus to grow “backwards,” she says in her caption explaining why her baby bump looks the way it does.

“For the first four months of my pregnancy, my uterus was retroverted/tilted, which means that I was growing backwards into my body rather than outwards,” her caption reads.

A post shared by Yiota Kouzoukas (@yiota) on Oct 1, 2017 at 2:12am PDT

While a fetus cannot grow “backwards,” reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist at CCRM Boston, Dr. Aaron Styer, points out, a backward tilt of the uterus can skew the size of a baby bump.

The common condition – affecting about one in five pregnant women – is “normal and does not increase a woman’s risk for infertility or miscarriage,” Dr. Styer says. But it is just one of the factors Kousoukas is dealing with in her pregnancy, which she explained on Instagram “for the reason of educating” people on the differences people experience during pregnancy.

“My uterus didn’t 'flip forward' until well into being 4 months pregnant because of the backwards tilted position paired with decade old endometriosis scarring that I have on my uterosacral ligaments. Basically, these ligaments are acting like anchors keeping my uterus 'inside' rather than 'outside', which is why I appeared smaller than most people for the first 4 or 5 months.”

Now the Australian influencer said she is “growing forwards” in her sixth month while “the scarring on [her] ligaments slowly breaks down.”

Kousoukas, who explains, “Social media has caused a shift that leads everyone to fixate on bump size rather than the health of the baby and mom to be,” is confident in her pregnancy and concludes her post with the important point: “I’m perfectly healthy, my baby is perfectly healthy, and that’s all that matters.

Colder weather brings us closer, but we often feel bored and irritable when the whole family is cooped up indoors. Instead of retreating to our own rooms or busying ourselves with more housework, consider starting a regular tradition for the family to enjoy together. There’s nothing quite as universally fun as a good game. Friendly competition and a lot of laughter is a recipe for a weekly family tradition that everyone will look forward to.

Dedicate a space to games and play. Now is an especially great time to get the game room ready before winter weather hits and you get snowed in for days on end. Despite the size of your space, you can always make room for fun. You could convert an attic, basement or den into a game room with some comfortable furniture, funky wall treatments and storage for toys, games and media.

Not all of us have enough space to dedicate an entire room to just games though. If not, make the most out of underused nooks by pulling up a couple of armchairs around a small table. You could also take advantage of double-duty furniture in your living room. Find a coffee table with built-in storage that makes board game setup and clean-up quick and easy. Don’t overlook decorative details either! Hang a scoreboard or stencil throw pillows with Scrabble-esque letters to instantly fun up any room.

Make it fun for everyone. The only way this will work is if everyone is having a good time. First, provide enough comfortable seating so every person feels included. Test each seat to make sure it’s positioned with a good view of the table, TV or everyone else in the room depending on what game you’re playing. A flexible seating arrangement with movable chairs and lightweight ottomans might be best.

Next, avoid making several trips up and down the stairs by keeping a variety of snacks closeby. If you have the luxury of adding a kitchenette to your room design, then go for it! Otherwise, loading up a tray or two will work just fine. Outfitting a cart with party supplies and packaged snacks can also work as a snack station for your game room. Pop some popcorn and pour drinks before you sit down to play. Preparing a snack might actually become part of your tradition. Every week you and your family can decide on a new snack to make and taste-test together, like fruit kabobs, homemade cookies or pigs in a blanket.

Lastly, allowing your kids to invite their friends to the first few game nights might be worth it. Even if you’re really looking forward to a night with the family, your kids - especially teens - might not be as keen on a night in with mom and dad. A lively group of friends for your very first game night could prove to your kids that this is a “cool” tradition to keep going.

Find the type of game you enjoy most. If game night feels forced, then it won’t be fun and it certainly won’t last long. Experiment with board games, card games, video games and even televised games to find something for everyone. If it’s a new game that you haven’t tried before make sure to spend some time reading and understanding the rules before game night begins. You’ll lose kids’ attention pretty quickly if you spend too long explaining the rules. It’s OK to have a couple of options too. Maybe two family members want to watch Monday night football while the other three play a game of Monopoly.

Special Forces soldier Bryan Black was among four soldiers killed in Niger earlier this month during a mission that remains somewhat unclear. The military is still trying to determine if the soldiers were randomly targeted or if they were led into an overwhelming ambush.

Michelle Black wants the nation to know her husband was more than a Special Forces soldier. He was also a master chess player and avid sportsman, she said, who spoke three languages, including Arabic and the local dialect in Niger, which made him something of a celebrity among his unit. She says most of all, he was an amazing husband and father.

Michelle Black said when it comes to the ongoing investigation into her husband’s death, the military is giving her guidance, but she’s not watching the news or following the day-to-day details. Someday, she said, she’ll need answers. But it won’t bring Bryan back.

But ironically, nearly 100 years later we’re still not fully free to exercise that right as we see fit, according to today’s feminists.

Now, instead of having men or the government controlling our behavior, other women are attempting to control our thoughts and tell us what we must do. According to modern day feminists, we are obligated to fall in lock step with them simply because we share the same body parts.

Isn’t the entire point of feminism for women to empower each other to be whoever we want to be, and do anything we want to do?

It turns out we didn’t read the fine print that says: except if you’re conservative, then you need to shut up because someone is obviously doing the thinking for you. Someone old and white and male. Because no legitimate, card-carrying female with our body parts would ever dare have a thought different from ours.

It’s been almost a year since the presidential election, but the liberal feminists still can’t wrap their heads around the fact that a majority of white women voted for a man instead of a woman for president.

One would think it’s time that we all channel our inner snow queen and “let it go.” But that’s not happening.

If you’re Hillary Clinton, it’s more fun instead to kick off a blame-game book tour and talk about all the reasons you lost (none of them your fault, of course).

Then, essentially accuse women who didn’t vote for you of being too dumb to think for themselves, by saying they voted the way their husbands and boyfriends told them to vote. Because, surely, a woman could never reject your candidacy on her own. Three cheers for girl power.

Then you have your like-minded feminist girl tribe come out and reinforce your attempt at women-shaming. Michelle Obama said women who didn’t vote for Hillary “voted against their own voice.” Is Mrs. Obama trying to tell us she voted in favor of her own voice in 2008 by secretly voting for Hillary instead of her own husband?

Her remarks were shortly followed by this gem from tennis icon Billie Jean King: “I’m upset with the white women that voted for Mr. Trump. I think they really don’t like themselves.” But the truth is, we like ourselves just fine – we just didn’t happen to like your candidate all that much.

The dictionary describes the women’s movement as “a broad movement campaigning for women’s liberation and rights.” Don’t those rights include the ability to think independently and come to a conclusion that differs from other women?

Technology executive and author Sheryl Sandberg said: “In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.” If that’s truly the endgame, how can we ever hope to stop differentiating between the two if we’re always throwing around the gender card?

If we’re making a practice out of shaming other women instead of empowering them and embracing our differences, then this exclusive type of feminism is really just a front for a particular brand of politics that really has nothing at all to do with women.. It’s time we call it just that.

Take the Mark Halperin and Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandals that recently broke, with the news about Halperin coming out even as the Weinstein revelations still reverberate. Weinstein’s accusers total at least 50 women over a period of 30 years, yet we’re just hearing about it now.

Women who were allegedly victimized by Weinstein were too afraid to speak out. As we’ve also discovered, other Hollywood elites saw it play out and sat on the sidelines in silence, including Jane Fonda, who has been a women’s rights activist for years. She recently said: “I guess it hadn't happened to me, and so I didn't feel that it was my place,” when explaining the reason for her silence and admitting that she knew about Weinstein.

Hillary Clinton’s presidential platform leaned heavily on being a champion of women’s rights, yet it took her five days to issue a statement about Weinstein. What was there to deliberate over for five days when women say they have been sexually abused for the last 30 years by a Hollywood bully?

A bully who happened to donate a lot of money to the Clinton Foundation, it’s worth noting. The foundation recently announced that it won’t return up to $250,000 in donations from Weinstein.

So much hypocrisy.

For decades we’ve been led to believe that feminism is about women. In reality, today’s feminism has very little to do with women. It’s an elitist, exclusive club where the rights of women are championed only if you are certain brand of woman and only if it suits a liberal political agenda.

If you are part of the 42 percent of women in this country who voted for President Trump you are not welcomed, empowered, or supported. Instead, you are shamed, criticized and reprimanded.

Women have made great strides and come too far in the last 100 years to be bullied into falling blindly in line with other women out of some fabricated sense of duty based purely on the fact that we share the same body parts. In that sense, Hillary’s loss was a victory for women – proof we won’t be controlled or manipulated by anyone.

TIME: Pregame coverage begins at 5:30 p.m.

Coming off one of their most impressive performances in recent years, the Orlando Magic will try to ride the momentum to a fourth straight win when they visit the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday night.

The Magic completed a two-game homestand with one of the most eye-catching results in the NBA this season Friday night, a 114-87 blowout of the San Antonio Spurs.

Evan Fournier led the way with 25 points, 12 of which coming on 4-for-4 3-point shooting. But the Magic was nearly equally efficient inside and out, recording 58 points from the perimeter and 56 from inside the paint against the perennially stingy Spurs.

Orlando Magic on FOX Sports Florida

""I'm impressed with how we're playing offensively,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel gushed after the win. ""Nobody is forcing things at the rim. Nobody's forcing it on the perimeter, and as a result, we're getting better and better looks on each possession. That's why you're seeing the offense clicking the way it's clicking.""

Orlando's 4-1 start also includes a 114-93 stunner at Cleveland. The Magic won just 29 games last season.

Saturday's game opens a four-day three-game trip that will continue through New Orleans and Memphis.

The Magic will encounter an old pal in the opener of the trip, one who's playing at a very high level these days.

Center Dwight Howard, who played the first eight years of his NBA career in Orlando, is now with his fifth team.

The first five games as a Hornet have gone quite well, with Howard averaging 14.4 points and 17.4 rebounds. He has snatched at least 15 rebounds in all five of his games, a first in Charlotte history.

Despite getting 19 points and 16 rebounds from Howard, the Hornets are coming off a 109-93 home loss to Houston on Friday. But they are expected to get another productive big man, Cody Zeller, back from a bruised right knee on Sunday.

Zeller contributed a total of 40 points, 25 rebounds, eight assists and five blocked shots when the Hornets dominated the Magic last season, sweeping the four-game series by an average of 21.8 points per game.

Without Zeller in the lineup, the Hornets have slipped defensively this season, having allowed 100 or more points in three of their five games.

They are 0-3 when giving up 100 or more, 2-0 when limiting the opposition to 99 or fewer.

The problem: The club has alternated its good and bad defensive performances, with the result being alternating losses and wins.

""There are still too many mistakes,"" Zeller observed from the bench. ""We have shown flashes of things to come -- that we can be one of the better defensive teams in the league.""

Continuing the pattern, the Hornets tipped off their current three-game homestand with a 110-93 win over Denver. But they followed that by allowing the Rockets to make 22 3-pointers in Friday's loss.

The Magic, meanwhile, have hit nearly 50 percent of its shots this season, up from 44 percent last year.

Orlando buried 57.1 percent of its attempts, including 47.8 percent of its 3-pointers, in Friday's win over San Antonio.",Preview: Magic riding high heading into matchup against Hornets,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/29/preview-magic-riding-high-heading-into-matchup-against-hornets.html

Images of starving children and adults emerged from the Ghouta suburbs, one of the hubs of the 2011 uprising against President Bashar Assad's rule, prompting U.N. officials to say the area is facing a humanitarian crisis.

Syria's state TV also reported Sunday that one person has been killed and several others injured in east Damascus after shells fired from rebel-held areas landed there.

The medical charity, also known as MSF, said it is ""extremely concerned"" because the fighting threatens its only cross-border supply routes between the two countries.

Scattered clashes have erupted in recent weeks as Iraqi forces have retaken disputed territory from the Kurds, part of a crisis sparked by last month's Kurdish vote for independence. Federal forces have sought to regain control of the country's borders from forces loyal to the Kurdish regional government.

The Fishkhabur crossing is the only gateway for residents, aid workers and journalists to enter northeastern Syria.

Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced the suspension Saturday, hours before Game 4 of the Fall Classic.

""I wanted the burden of this discipline to fall primarily on the wrongdoer,"" Manfred said. ""I was impressed in my conversation with Yu Darvish by his desire to move forward, and I felt that moving the suspension to the beginning of the season would help in that regard.""

After Gurriel homered off Darvish in the second inning Friday, he put his fingers to the side of his eyes and said ""chinito"" — a derogatory Spanish term that translates literally to ""little Chinese.""

Darvish was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and Iranian father. He played professionally in Japan from 2005-11 before joining the Texas Rangers in 2012.

Darvish, who was dealt to the Dodgers at the July 31 trade deadline this year, expressed anger about what happened.

""Acting like that, you just disrespect all the people around the world,"" he said in Japanese through a translator.

Gurriel, who was born in Cuba, apologized after the game. Speaking in Spanish through a translator, Gurriel said that he was ""commenting to my family that I didn't have any luck against Japanese pitchers here in the United States.""

On Saturday, Gurriel released a formal statement saying his gesture was ""offensive"" and ""indefensible.""

""I sincerely apologize to everyone that I offended with my actions,"" Gurriel said. ""I deeply regret it.""

""There is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night,"" said Manfred, who later added, ""There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable.""

Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow said in a statement that the club was ""surprised and disappointed"" by Gurriel's actions.

""Yuli has always demonstrated respectful behavior and is extremely remorseful for his actions,"" Luhnow said. ""He had no intention of offending anyone, but now recognizes the perceived offensiveness of his actions.""

Gurriel's homer came as part of a four-run second inning, which chased Darvish from the game and propelled the Astros to a 5-3 victory. Houston leads the best-of-seven series 2-1.

By comparison, an average level IQ for a human is between 90 and 110. Geniuses such as Stephen Hawking have been estimated to have an IQ level around 160. However, Hawking has never taken an official intelligence test, according to a report in British newspaper The Independent.

Mensa, the self-proclaimed ""high IQ society,"" admits people to become members after they have demonstrated intelligence levels ""at or above the 98th percentile on certain standardized IQ or other approved intelligence tests."" For Stanford–Binet, the minimum accepted score is 132, whereas for the Cattell test, it is 148.

Singularity is rapidly approaching

The timeframe for singularity, the concept that machines will become smarter than the human brain, is up for debate.

In March, Google’s Director of Engineering Ray Kurzweil said that by 2029 ""computers will have human-level intelligence.""

For his part, Son has repeatedly said it will happen in the ""next 30 years or so.""

He has helped position his company Softbank, which also owns a controlling stake in U.S. telecom provider Sprint, for the upcoming singularity.

In May 2017, Softbank launched the Vision Fund, which is targeting up to $100 billion in investments around the world, for companies ""that seek to enable the next age of innovation."" This includes areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, mobile applications and computing.

Since its launch, the fund has made a number of investments, including the aforementioned stake in Nvidia, a $4 billion investment in workplace startup WeWork, and is reported to be working on a major investment in Uber, which is working on autonomous vehicles.

In addition to Softbank's investments in the AI space, it already has a humanoid robot, Pepper, which can perceive a person's emotions. Son envisions that is just the beginning, saying robots will learn by themselves and ""maybe [are] going to laugh at you and us. Today they look cute, they will stay cute, but they will be super smart.""

In August, a Pepper robot became an ordained Buddhist priest.

ELON MUSK THINKS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD CAUSE WORLD WAR III

Perils despite the promise

While Son, 60, appears to be betting on the promise and the positive effect that intelligent robots may have on society, not everyone is on board.

Luminaries such as Hawking and tech executive Elon Musk have warned against the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, though not necessarily in robot form.

Last month, Musk tweeted that artificial intelligence could cause World War 3, following comments made by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that the country ""who becomes the leader in this sphere [artificial intelligence] will be the ruler of the world.""

Hawking has also sounded the alarm bells, going so far as to say, ""The development of full artificial intelligence (AI) could spell the end of the human race.""

This past week, Sophia, a humanoid robot, became the first robot to receive citizenship of a country, being awarded citizenship in Saudi Arabia.

After it received the citizenship, Sophia was interviewed by a member of the media about concerns it could do harm to humanity. It responded, by saying, ""You've been reading too much Elon Musk. And watching too many Hollywood movies. Don't worry, if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you.""

The star courted outrage on Wednesday after dedicating a tweet to the “Roar” singer on her birthday.

“Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!” the star wrote over an image of her gawking, mouth agape, at Perry’s breasts.

In the wake of the recent Harvey Weinstein scandal, of which DeGeneres was an outspoken critic, dedicating part of her show to sharing her thoughts on the “#MeToo” movement, many fans were quick to mention the idea that this tweet wouldn’t fly had a man posted it. Many began responding to the tweet with the hashtag “#doublestandard.” Others went as far as to compare her to Weinstein and call her a “pig.”

As The Wrap notes, actor Michael Rapaport caught wind of the tweet and voiced his displeasure to Ellen, arguing that “the world would stop” if a man had sent this tweet.

Piers Morgan too speculated that, had a man tweeted something similar, Ellen would be leading the “cries of ‘SEXIST PIG!’”

Previously, the star dedicated her opening monologue to denouncing the growing environment of sexual harassment in Hollywood with an impassioned speech.

“This is not a male thing or a female thing, it is not a Hollywood or political thing, this is a human thing and it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world and we are all the same,” she said. “We all want the same thing, we want respect, love and kindness.

Somebody violated their oath of secrecy,” Gowdy, a South Carolina lawmaker and former federal prosecutor, also told Fox News on Sunday.
“The Mueller investigation has become an all-out assault to find crimes to pin on them — and it won’t matter if there are no crimes to be found.
Federal agents, reportedly in search of evidence related to the Russia investigation, this summer raided his northern Virginia home.
The FBI also secured approval from a federal court to monitor the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.","Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, the leader of the House’s top investigative committee, slammed special counsel Robert Mueller on Sunday for allowing the news media to learn that he and his legal team now have charges in their Russia investigation.

“In the only conversation I’ve had with Robert Mueller, I stressed to him the importance of cutting out the leaks,” Gowdy, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told “Fox News Sunday.” “It’s kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and the violations of the law would violate the law.”

Mueller and his team have for roughly the past five months been investigating for the Justice Department whether anybody associated with the President Trump’s 2016 White House campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election outcome. On Friday night, CNN reported that Mueller’s team has filed the first charges in the case with a federal grand jury.

“Make no mistake, disclosing grand jury material is a violation of the law. Somebody violated their oath of secrecy,” Gowdy, a South Carolina lawmaker and former federal prosecutor, also told Fox News on Sunday.

The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that anyone charged will be taken into custody Monday. However, the charges have been sealed by a federal judge. So whoever is charged and whether the charges are criminal remains unclear.

The possible charges come as Mueller's tactics have been called into question.

During a raid by the FBI in July of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's Virginia home, a source close to the investigation told Fox News at the time the scope of the search was ""heavy-handed, designed to intimidate.""

Andrew Weissmann, the prosecutor tapped by Mueller to help lead the investigation, has also received criticism. Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor recently wrote about Weissman in a piece titled, “Judging by Mueller's staffing choices, he may not be very interested in justice.”

Powell accused Weissmann, once the director of the Enron Task Force, of “prosecutorial overreach” in past cases and said it could signal what’s to come for President Trump and his associates in the Russia probe.

“What was supposed to have been a search for Russia’s cyberspace intrusions into our electoral politics has morphed into a malevolent mission targeting friends, family and colleagues of the president,” Powell wrote in The Hill. “The Mueller investigation has become an all-out assault to find crimes to pin on them — and it won’t matter if there are no crimes to be found. This team can make some.”

Powell cited several cases where Weissmann won convictions that were later overturned.

During a Saturday appearance on Fox News, former Department of Justice official Robert Driscoll told anchor Leland Vittert it’s possible the indictment might not even be directly tied to Russian collusion.

“Think back to the Clinton years,” Driscoll said. “The Whitewater investigation was about an Arkansas land deal. And it ended up being about something else completely.”

Driscoll added, “Robert Mueller is free to look at taxes, is free to look at lobbying filings, foreign agent filings. Things like that could all be involved that wouldn’t necessarily touch on the issue of Russia collusion that everyone seems focused on politically.”

Speculation has focused on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as likely targets.

Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago -- for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017.

Federal agents, reportedly in search of evidence related to the Russia investigation, this summer raided his northern Virginia home. He also was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.

Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired for failing to fully disclose his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then-Russian ambassador to the United States.

The FBI also secured approval from a federal court to monitor the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

On Saturday, Page released a statement to Fox News in response to questions about whether he or his lawyers have been notified about any charges.

Page said in the statement that he has worked with the executive branch and Congress since being contacted in March. But he also suggested that revelations about the Democratic Party having helped finance a dossier to smear Trump has tainted any Russia probe.

“In terms of ‘charges', I can’t even imagine what might even be considered now that the false evidence from the politically-motivated, big-money-financed Dodgy Dossier that started this extrajudicial disaster has instead been so thoroughly exposed as a complete sham,” Carter wrote in the statement.

Richard Hibey, an attorney for Manafort, told Fox News on Friday that neither he nor any of his colleagues representing Manafort had been informed of any indictment of their client.

Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago – for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017. In addition to his home being raided, Manafort was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.

A retired Army lieutenant general, Flynn served as a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired over his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia's ambassador to the United States.

Mueller has reportedly probed whether Flynn was involved in a private effort to get former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers.

The Justice Department’s special counsel’s office declined to comment on the reports of filed charges.

Trump has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as “a witch hunt”.

With the Dodgers three innings from falling into a deep deficit, the rookie slugger sparked a late comeback that stopped the Houston Astros' surge.

Hitless in 13 at-bats, Bellinger doubled and scored the tying run in the seventh inning, then doubled home the go-ahead run off struggling closer Ken Giles in a five-run ninth that lifted Los Angeles to a 6-2 win Saturday night and tied the Series at two games apiece.

George Springer put the Astros ahead with a two-out homer in the sixth, the first hit off Los Angeles starter Alex Wood. The crowd at Minute Maid Park, where the Astros had been 7-0 this postseason, was revved up in anticipation of the Astros having a chance to win the first title in their 56-season history on Sunday.

Instead, the Series will go back to Los Angeles no matter what. Clayton Kershaw starts Game 5 for the Dodgers on Sunday night and Dallas Keuchel for the Astros in a rematch of the opener, when Kershaw pitched Los Angeles to a 3-1 win.

Bellinger, a 22-year-old bopper who set a National League rookie record with 39 home runs this season, struck out four times in Game 3 and once more in the fifth inning — his eighth whiff of the Series.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed faith Friday night in Bellinger and again Saturday afternoon.

Bellinger doubled over left fielder Marwin Gonzalez, chasing starter Charlie Morton, and came home on Logan Forsythe's two-out single off Will Harris.

Giles entered to start the ninth and got into immediate trouble, allowing a leadoff single to Corey Seager and a walk to Justin Turner. Bellinger took a low slider, then lined a fastball at the letters to left-center. He raised a hand rounding first and clapped his hands half a dozen times in excitement after sliding into second.

He really knew where he was going.”Armstrong wasn’t the only one to take note of Cruise’s drive and movie star looks.
A post shared by Jen Brill Studio (@jenbrillstudio) on Mar 7, 2016 at 9:24am PST“It was the ‘80s,” joked Armstrong.
A post shared by Lauren Grosso (@laurengrosso) on Aug 6, 2017 at 8:35pm PDT“He said, ‘Let me tell you something’,” recalled Armstrong.","For Curtis Armstrong, it was hard to top the first film he had done in Hollywood — 1983’s “Risky Business.” So when the role of a fraternity brother named Booger with a gross habit came along the following year, the actor almost turned it down on the spot.

“I was somebody [who] never imagined being in films in the first place,” the 63-year-old told Fox News about appearing in 1984’s “Revenge of the Nerds.” The star recently chronicled the stories behind his many popular roles in the memoir, “Revenge of the Nerd.”

“I always saw myself as a stage actor,"" he explained. ""And when ‘Risky Business’ happened, when it was finished, it was so amazing. I thought, 'If I’m going to follow up with that, I don’t want to follow it up with something poor.'

""And I found Booger to be an embarrassment. What there was of him in that original script was basically the same as it is now. It’s mainly nose picking and belching. And the sort of misogynist cracks.”

However, Armstrong couldn’t afford to be picky. Needing a job, he reluctantly accepted the role — and it turned out to be one of the best decisions he's ever made.

Not only was the cast given the freedom to work on their characters and do improvisations to make them their own, but “Revenge of the Nerds” became a cult classic with legions of fans still watching the slapstick comedy today.

“We were all proud of the work we had done,” recalled Armstrong. “We got in there thinking it was a stupid sex comedy and now it was our stupid sex comedy.”

Still, Armstrong wasn’t expecting the movie, which tells the tale of bullied outcasts fighting back against non-stop harassment, to develop a mass following over the years.

“There was a time when I kind of would have liked to have seen a little less Booger when it came to meeting people,” he admitted. “And people shouting at me in the streets. And being so closely identified with that character. However, time goes by, and I found that I really understood what the appeal was.

""As I look at it now with distance, I realize now that it actually was a pretty good acting job. I didn’t think it would have been at the time… I feel pretty good about it now… I have absolutely no problem with it and I haven’t for many, many, many years.”

Since the ‘80s, Armstrong has worked non-stop in Hollywood and has developed a resume that features more than 150 film and TV roles. But it all started with “Risky Business,” also known as the time he worked with a 19-year-old newcomer named Tom Cruise. Armstrong was 28 at the time.

“I was struck not just by his talent, which was obvious, but by his commitment to succeed,” said Armstrong. “… For somebody who was that young, he seemed to have a very clear idea of where he was going. As far as I was concerned, as long as people hired me to do plays, I’m happy. I never had an endgame in sight. My only endgame was the same one that I have now, which is to keep on acting until I drop. But he was different. He really knew where he was going.”

Armstrong wasn’t the only one to take note of Cruise’s drive and movie star looks. In his book, Armstrong described witnessing young girls lining up outside of his room on set while he was reportedly catching up on Bible studies.

A post shared by Jen Brill Studio (@jenbrillstudio) on Mar 7, 2016 at 9:24am PST

“It was the ‘80s,” joked Armstrong. “There were certainly some shenanigans going on.”

But there was one girl that caught Cruise’s eye. He and his co-star, 23-year-old Rebecca De Mornay “engaged in an intense affair,” Armstrong claimed.

“The relationship between Tom and Rebecca was extremely well-publicized at the time,” said Armstrong. “The two of them were together for quite a while. It wasn’t just an on-set thing. They were together I believe for a year or two afterwards. So that was a serious relationship.”

A post shared by MuseumTV (@museumtv) on Mar 3, 2017 at 6:41am PST

But that wouldn’t be the last time Armstrong noticed some drama while filming. When he later took on the ‘80s TV series “Moonlighting,” he soon learned that co-stars Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd hated each other, as the actress later admitted to Entertainment Weekly in 2005.



“Everybody has their own opinions about what the reason was,” said Armstrong. “After a while, they were barely even trying to hide it… It was a fairly well-known fact that they did not get along… I think there was a briefcase thrown at one point.

""But mainly, it was stuff that would sort of bubble up and then the rest of us would be sent to our trailers while they worked out whatever the issues were. And sometimes we would never come back at all. They would come knocking on the door and say, ‘Go home because we’re not going to get anything done today.'”

Despite the tension, Armstrong was impressed by Willis’ eagerness to learn everything about camera angles and lighting to capture the perfect shot for any scene.

“He was still pretty seriously partying at that point in his life,” said Armstrong. “… But he just soaked up that technical stuff like a sponge… He used to do a game where he could figure out which lens [the cameramen] were using without them telling him. He did it every time we would shoot a scene.”

When Armstrong finally approached Willis about his seemingly strange behavior, the actor, who would go on to become an action star, didn’t hesitate to respond.

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ.
Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.","“The older my kids get, the more I realize how little control I have over them. My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

Still, others will go too far, making some crude political statement or dressing their toddler like a French maid or Monica Lewinsky.
And in this game called Halloween, all that is necessary for us to have something for us to talk about next year.
I believe in Halloween, Jesus and the Pledge of Allegiance, and it is a good year to celebrate for the sake of nonsense and candy corn.","It was 1982. That is the first Halloween I remember the hum of petrified parents. It was the first time we didn’t get to go trick or treating, no not even one street over. Instead, we had a makeshift party at a neighbor’s house. The TV news turned on low warned of tainted Tylenol.

The next year was the first time we took our candy to the police station to be X-rayed to check for needles and razor blades. We heard the adults whisper: “What is the world coming to?”

We didn’t know, but I thought as police checked out my candy: “Easy with that full-size Snickers you’re manhandling!”

As an adult with children ranging in age from 3 to 22, I have seen just about everything in the ways of Halloween. From the politically incorrect to the religiously correct to the “yeah, just give us some freaking candy,” everyone has an opinion.

And every year there is some new rule or renegade rant about all the souls that have come and gone, and may or may not stop by for some creepy punch served over dry ice. Dry ice, by the way, is very dangerous when handled with bare hands.

As I watched volunteers wander into the haunted house at my daughter’s school, I noted that 35 years ago those costumes would have sent me to counseling. My husband whimpered and covered the eyes of our 5-year-old as a cheerleader with high-def cosmetics entered, carrying what was supposed to be her own head under one arm.

Everything is more terrifying now, in make-believe and in real life.

In real life, gunmen take people out with high-powered rifles at concerts, and bad guys put poison and needles in caramel apples. But that is the minority. I refuse to believe it is the majority or the rule.

In the infamous words of Linus in Charles Schultz’s “The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown”:

“There are three things I've learned never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin.”

When it comes to Halloween, there are some who will lock themselves away in fear of what might happen, or to nurse their wounds because of what did happen. There are some who lock themselves away in protest.

There are others who call it something else, like a fest or a carnival so as not to offend or beckon souls. Still, others will go too far, making some crude political statement or dressing their toddler like a French maid or Monica Lewinsky.

And in this game called Halloween, all that is necessary for us to have something for us to talk about next year. Some grand opinion, some horrific worry, some hill to die on, or some great offense that rocks us to our core and gets us out of bed to write that letter, so that we might be heard.

I find myself wishing I was sitting in a pumpkin patch with Linus, a sheet over my head, never mind the thread count, two holes cut out for eyes. I make no statement with this sheet. I courageously eat unwrapped Rice Krispies that the neighbor dropped in my bucket. I don’t care how she voted in the last election. I wait patiently for something magical to happen, less publicized and political than Santa.

Old-fashioned innocence, the kind that causes cavities and mischief. I believe in Halloween, Jesus and the Pledge of Allegiance, and it is a good year to celebrate for the sake of nonsense and candy corn.

“He asked me, 'Don’t you know who Bruce Maxwell is?
Hearing this was a slap in the face.”Henry also noted that Maxwell was very polite during the meal, never raising any eyebrows.
Maxwell became the first and only MLB player to kneel during the national anthem at a game against the Texas Rangers on September 23.
A spokesperson for the Oakland A’s told Fox News that the club has no comment, and that Maxwell stands by his story and is not doing further interviews at this time.","Oakland A’s catcher Bruce Maxwell, 26, claimed this week that a waiter in his Alabama hometown of Huntsville refused him service after identifying him as the MLB player who took the knee during “The Star Spangled Banner” last month — only the waiter has a very different version of events and he told Fox News that was far from what went down.

“He is outright lying. This is really upsetting as he was given full service, I didn’t even know who Bruce Maxwell was,” Matt Henry, a 42-year-old waiter at Keegan’s Public House, told Fox News. “This all started because I carded his friend who wanted to order a beer.”

According to Henry, an Alabama native, Maxwell was dining with local Democratic councilman Devyn Keith and another friend who produced an expired ID, and the server refused to serve him a drink — which upset the friend, who followed him into the kitchen.

“He asked me, 'Don’t you know who Bruce Maxwell is?', and told me I was making everyone feel uncomfortable. Nobody was even paying attention to them,” Henry claimed.

“I didn’t know anything about him or the kneeling. All I know is a friend of mine 15 years ago lost his job for serving someone a drink who happened to be underage, so if anyone looks under 30, I’m going to card them.”

The waiter said that the councilman then complained to the restaurant’s manager about Maxwell being uncomfortable, and the manager simply swapped me to another table, and that it was “no big deal.”

The restaurant manager on duty that day, Anne Whalen — who requested the restaurant name not be used without permission from the owner — also told Fox News that Maxwell’s story being portrayed in the media could not be further from the truth.

“Matt came to me and told me that a guy wanted a beer but his ID was not valid and I told him he absolutely could not give it to him, we can go to jail for that in the state of Alabama,"" the manager said.

""It was his friend causing all the fuss, none of us even knew who this baseball player was. I told him I had no idea who he was going on about,” she said. “Eventually Matt just asked if we could put another server on the table so I did. … I can’t believe the story.”

TRUMP DECRIES ‘NO LEADERSHIP IN NFL’ AFTER MORE ANTHEM PROTESTS

Whalen said that of the three men, Maxwell was the only one who produced a valid ID and thus was the only one they served a beer to.

However, Maxwell told TMZ Sports this week — and headlines since have spanned the globe — that the waiter said to him, “You’re the guy who took the knee?” After confirming he was, Maxwell alleged that the waiter then responded, “I voted for Trump, and I stand for everything he stands for,” and then refused to serve him.

This allegedly prompted the councilman, who is a high school friend and is African-American, to approach the restaurant’s manager who then mitigated the situation by putting another waiter on their table.

“We didn’t even discuss Trump. I was working two jobs, I don’t have time for rallies,” Henry continued. “If this all happened a month ago, why suddenly now is he claiming all this now?”

NFL, PLAYERS LEAVE DOOR OPEN ON KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The pro-baseball rookie also claimed to TMZ that he was racially profiled by the server, of which Henry vehemently denies.

“It’s really easy for people to point a finger at Alabama, and that’s what has upset me about this fabrication the most,” Henry noted. “This is one of the best places to live in America, if not the planet. Hearing this was a slap in the face.”

Henry also noted that Maxwell was very polite during the meal, never raising any eyebrows. Whalen said that the men happily paid their bill without objection and left after their meal.

Maxwell became the first and only MLB player to kneel during the national anthem at a game against the Texas Rangers on September 23. He is also the son of a U.S. Army veteran and previously stated that the point of his kneeling was not to disrespect the military, but to draw attention to the “racial divide that is being practiced from the highest power.”

“Unless you’re subjected to it, you won’t feel it,” Maxwell also told TMZ. “I’m very respectful, I’m very educated. And it still happens to this day. And so … that’s the reason I kneel.”

Henry told Fox News that he started at the local restaurant a couple of months ago, but left two weeks ago only because of health issues from working two jobs and now is working only one.

A spokesperson for the Oakland A’s told Fox News that the club has no comment, and that Maxwell stands by his story and is not doing further interviews at this time.

A representative for Keith did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Keith previously told the Washington Post that the whole incident was “an embarrassment.”",Waiter: MLB catcher Bruce Maxwell made up story about service refusal over anthem protest,http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/10/25/waiter-mlb-catcher-bruce-maxwell-made-up-story-about-service-refusal-over-anthem-protest.html

Like so many other items on the left’s wish list, bail bond reform might sound good at first.","For any liberal to entertain winning the Democratic nomination for president these days, there are some important boxes to be checked, including taking on America’s system of law and order. Now Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has begun checking the boxes.

Zuckerberg has hired Hillary Clinton’s pollster. He’s hired Barack Obama’s campaign manager. He’s even visited the first presidential caucus state of Iowa. And he’s pandering to the left’s machine by funding a campaign that aims to get rid of our nation’s bail system.

In the dangerous push to end our current bail system, liberals like Zuckerberg are arguing that people across America are being wrongly held in jail because they can’t afford to post bail. This is ridiculous. Our bail system is in place to keep law-abiding Americans safe and to ensure that a person accused of a crime actually appears in court so justice is served.

States that have attempted to pass bail reform policies are seeing the failures of unsecured release up close. Harris County in Texas is fighting a federal lawsuit claiming its bail schedule is unconstitutional and that it keeps poor people in jail.

Chief U.S. District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal issued a federal order requiring Harris County to make immediate changes to its pretrial release system. The order requires the sheriff’s office to release anyone charged with a misdemeanor offense on unsecured release within 24 hours.

According to Harris County data since the order took effect, 32 percent of defendants released on unsecured bond have failed to appear for court, compared to only 4 percent released on a surety bond. Failures to appear cause havoc and long delays in the criminal justice system. Justice cannot be served if the accused does not appear for court.

Examples of such releases are occurring in other jurisdictions around the country. A New Jersey theater employee was arrested after law enforcement officers found a bullet-proof vest, grenade, guns and ammunition in his vehicle, causing the theater to be evacuated. He was determined not to be a danger to the community and released on unsecured bond under the new law.

New Jersey’s liberal bail reforms caused one state legislator to send a letter to the speaker of the state Assembly in California regarding a similar bill circulating in his state. The letter states that “dangerous and career criminals are released daily within hours of arrest” with no accountability. He urged the California Legislature not to make the same mistake.

While everyone is innocent until proven guilty, judges are right to set bail for individuals who are charged with a crime. Too many are simply being sent back into the poorest neighborhoods, which proponents of bail reform like Zuckerberg don’t live in.

These released individuals, many of whom are repeat offenders, walk out of jail and continue to victimize the very people proponents of bail reform claim to protect – the poor and indigent.

Unsecured release methods and the use of flawed risk assessment tools are coming under fire every day. The Arnold Foundation, which developed a risk assessment tool being used by several jurisdictions such as New Jersey, is a defendant in a federal lawsuit seeking damages in a wrongful death case.

A career criminal, who had been arrested on felony gun charges days earlier, was released on unsecured means using the Arnold Foundation’s risk assessment tool and then allegedly committed murder.

Elitists like Zuckerberg try to make the argument that the bail system is unfair to poor people, but fail to understand that law-abiding citizens regardless of income level expect laws to be enforced that will keep them safe.

There is nothing safe about the bail reforms currently being implemented and under consideration. Liberals roll out examples of people being held for minor and non-violent crimes who are forced to be away from their families because they couldn’t afford monetary bail. Some such examples do exist.

However, for every one of those stories, there are also stories regarding serious and violent offenders who walk out of jail with no accountability. Headlines such as “Eastside restaurant manager, employees accused of raping woman” and “Jackson zoning board member grabbed gun before child porn arrest, cops say” are all too common.

What is Zuckerberg’s answer to these headlines? Like so many other items on the left’s wish list, bail bond reform might sound good at first. However, in the real world where the rest of us live, there are plenty of concerns for tens of millions of Americans who wish to raise their families in a safe society.

Americans expect that when people are accused of stealing, selling illegal drugs, abusing others, driving drunk and otherwise breaking the law, they will appear in court. If convicted, such individuals will be punished for their crimes so that justice will be served.

As the bail bond reform debate continues and Mark Zuckerberg continues his multimillion-dollar quest to boost his standing with the far left’s power structure, I hope most Americans can understand that when it comes to thinking about reforming our bail system, it’s better to be safe than sorry.",Mark Zuckerberg and liberals seek to weaken bail system that keeps us safe,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/mark-zuckerberg-and-liberals-seek-to-weaken-bail-system-that-keeps-us-safe.html

Hillary Clinton’s campaign didn’t just pay for the Kremlin-aided smear job on Donald Trump before the election; she continued to use the dirt after the election to frame her humiliating loss as a Russian conspiracy to steal the election.

Bitter to the core, she and her campaign aides hatched a scheme, just 24 hours after conceding the race, to spoon-feed the dirty rumors to an eager liberal media and manufacture the narrative Russia secretly colluded with her neophyte foe to sabotage her coronation.

Great stories in this episode include an underage Carly trying out for Dollywood, an exuberant Clayton opening up for Kenny Chesney and a broken-down van that made it to the venue on time with the help of five random cousins in rural West Virginia. As Clayton puts it, ""when you're out on the road, everything is not as glamorous as it seems.""

Both artists sing some of their best, with Carly telling the story behind her big hit ""Every Little Thing"" before sharing a beautiful rendition of the soulful ballad.

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

You may have heard of, or even created, a home inventory before. This record, often used to document belongings for insurance purposes, can also be a really helpful tool if you are trying to declutter, prepare for emergencies, clear space for a remodel or just get organized. Check out these tips to create a thorough home inventory and streamline your belongings at the same time.

Make Your Inventory

Choose your checklist. The first step in making a home inventory is getting your hands on a comprehensive checklist — one from your own insurance company is best. Review the checklist before getting started.

Work through your home, room by room. Following your checklist, work your way slowly through the entire house — you may want to divvy up the task over several weekends. Record a brief description of each item, how many you have, how much it cost and the year you purchased it.

Don't leave out any nooks or crannies. Craft rooms, sheds, attics, workshops, porches and garages should all be carefully examined and documented.

Supplement with photos or video. Using digital photos is one option, but you may find it easier to create a video tour of your home to document your belongings. Whether you are taking photos or video, start at the front and work your way through each room — try to go in the same order used on your checklist.

Add a storage map. Noting down where exactly in the house everything is stored can be incredibly useful when you need to find something, whether it's an emergency or just time to hang the Christmas lights.

Use an actual floor plan if you have one; if not, you can create your own simple sketch of each floor of your house. Being as specific as possible, note where in each room boxes or other items are stored.

Keep paperwork in one place. Gather receipts, credit card statements, appraisal documents and the like, and keep them bundled with your other home inventory materials.

Even better, take the time to scan everything and store the digital archive in at least two places.

Use Your Home Inventory to Declutter

Get rid of unnecessary multiples. Cutting back on excess multiples can free up a lot of space in your home, but actually getting rid of unneeded things is easier said than done. Your home inventory checklist can make things easier by providing emotional distance.

Read over your list and mark any items you have a lot of. Do you really need all of those extra dishes? Start a list of things you want to sell or donate.

Highlight valuable items. Especially note valuable pieces you've been holding onto for a long time but are not necessarily using. Do online research and estimate what you could sell the pieces for. Would you rather have the extra space and money? If so, let those pieces go!

Mark your calendar for a big junk toss. You know that stuff you've been meaning to toss but haven't found the motivation to? We all have it. Now that you know exactly what and where yours is, set a date to (finally) take care of it.

Get prepared by researching where you can take it — things in good condition may be candidates for donation, while others may need to be dropped at a special recycling center. Involving a reward at the end of your day of errands is always a good plan!

Box everything. Now that you've cleared out space in your storage areas, think about ways to make your storage really work for you. One simple but effective strategy is to tuck every single item in storage — whether in closets, cupboards or in deep storage — into a box or bin.

Containers instantly make things look neater, and it's also easier to shift items around or grab a box you need rather than trying to unload armfuls of loose stuff from a shelf.

Use storage for rotating items too. Free up space in cupboards, closets, shelves and counters for the items you actually use daily, and pack away the rest. This is one of the best ways to make your life easier, without getting rid of a drastic amount of stuff. Simply rotate in fresh dishes, linens and decorative items seasonally.

RELATED: Storage Cabinets That Fit Your Every Need

Consider digital backups. Creating digital backups (photos or scans) of important paper records, photos, kids’ art and other memorabilia can offer peace of mind. For less sentimental items, you may choose to actually toss the originals and keep only the digital record.

Remember to also …

Update your inventory. Anytime you buy something new or get rid of something on your list, pull out that inventory and note the change. If it’s something new you are adding, use this as a cue to look for a similar item on your inventory to get rid of. It’s much easier to keep clutter at bay than deal with it after things have gotten out of hand.

Keep a copy of your inventory offsite. Use a safe-deposit box or an online cloud-based storage system to keep your home inventory and all supporting documents secure.",How to create a home inventory to be organized and prepared for emergencies,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/how-to-create-home-inventory-to-be-organized-and-prepared-for-emergencies.html

""If you hold down the woman while the rapist is raping her, and you didn't rape her, are you a rapist?""","President Donald Trump has mocked left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore, tweeting Saturday that the director's one-man Broadway show was ""a TOTAL BOMB"".

Moore, the director of several documentaries including ""Roger and Me,"" ""Bowling for Columbine,"" and ""Farenheit 9/11,"" responded later Saturday with a tweet of his own.

Moore's show, ""The Terms of My Surrender,"" ended its 13-week run Oct. 22. The website BroadwayWorld.com reported that it took in $4.2 million at the box office, less than half of its potential take.

The show, which combined Moore's autobiography with calls for political action against Trump and other Republicans, was a critical disappointment as well. The New York Times described ""Terms of My Surrender"" as ""shaggy and self-aggrandizing.""

""You don’t have to disagree with Mr. Moore’s politics to find that his shtick has become disagreeable with age,"" wrote reviewer Jesse Green, who compared the show to ""being stuck at Thanksgiving dinner with a garrulous, self-regarding, time-sucking uncle.""

Moore has been an outspoken critic of Trump. In August, Moore led the show's audience to Trump Tower to protest the president's reaction to deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. That same night, he compared the president's supporters to accomplices in a rape during an interview with CNN.

""If you hold down the woman while the rapist is raping her, and you didn't rape her, are you a rapist?"" Moore said at the time. ""Let's cut the BS and start speaking honestly.""

This week, Moore told the Wall Street Journal in an email that the show was ""the most artistically gratifying experience of my life"" and said there were ""talks happening about taking this show on the road.""

The USS Ashland, part of the Navy's 7th Fleet, picked up Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiaba, both from Honolulu, after they were discovered 900 miles southeast of Japan by a Taiwanese fishing vessel.

The mariners had originally set sail with their two dogs from Hawaii to Tahiti this spring. After having engine problems on May 30 during bad weather, the two thought they could make it to land by using only their sail, according to the Navy.

Two months later, way after when they were originally supposed to arrive in Tahiti, Appel and Fuiaba began to issue distress calls.

""The two continued the calls daily, but they were not close enough to other vessels or shore stations to receive them,"" the Navy said.

The pair survived so long at sea by bringing water purifiers and over a year's worth of food on board, primarily in the form of dry goods such as oatmeal, pasta and rice, according to Appel.

""I'm grateful for their service to our country. They saved our lives,"" Appel said. ""The pride and smiles we had when we saw [U.S. Navy] on the horizon was pure relief.""

The two mariners will remain on board the Ashland until the ship's next port of call. The ship has been on routine deployment for the past five months to respond to maritime situations.

The University of California, Santa Barbara recently held a Social Justice Workshop to teach students how to spot Halloween costume abuse and appropriation.
Similarly, Washington State University’s Social Justice Peer Educators Group held an event entitled “We’re a Culture, Not a Costume” to teach people about “harmful” Halloween costumes, according to Acculturated.
“Some Halloween costumes reinforce stereotypes of particular races, genders, cultures, or religions,” the administration wrote.","It’s one of the busiest times of the year for college social justice warriors: Halloween.

The mere possibility of someone dressing up in what could be viewed as an ""offensive"" costume is causing several colleges to proactively warn students -- using guides, checklists, workshops, threats of probes and investigations. Even offering 24/7 counseling.

Recently, schools cracked down on non-politically correct outfits, from creepy clowns to Caitlyn Jenner, and just about everything in between.

“The scariest thing about your costume isn’t what you think,” according to a “Halloween and Cultural Appropriation Tabling” event at Goucher College in Maryland.

The University of St. Thomas in Minnesota put up “Costume or Culture Appropriation” fliers listing “unacceptable” costumes and clothing as including Native American headdresses, a Mexican sombrero, a geisha outfit or any form of blackface.

“Cultural appropriation is defined as ‘the act of taking intellectual and cultural expressions from a culture that is not your own, without showing that you understand or respect the culture,’” the flier read.

Offensive costumes incorporate “a long history of prejudice, hate, discrimination, colonialism, and slavery” as well as turning “an important and/or sacred element into fashion.”

And just in case you don't get easily offended by costumes, several universities are ready to help.

The University of California, Santa Barbara recently held a Social Justice Workshop to teach students how to spot Halloween costume abuse and appropriation.

Similarly, Washington State University’s Social Justice Peer Educators Group held an event entitled “We’re a Culture, Not a Costume” to teach people about “harmful” Halloween costumes, according to Acculturated.

The University of Massachusetts, Amherst put up “Simple Costume Racism Evaluation and Assessment Meter” (SCREAM) posters around campus, assigning threat levels based on how much a costume differs from the student’s own race.

Ohio State University’s student magazine had a similar flow chart this year that supports costumes that “make fun of Donald Trump,” but warns white students not to dress as Prince or wear “traditional head wear from other cultures.”

A Notre Dame Residence hall rector sent out a memo to her students before a Disney-themed dance not to dress up as Moana, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Mulan or The Princess and the Frog.

At the University of Utah, a newsletter put out by the Student Affairs Diversity Council, tells students to avoid Halloween costumes if it is labeled “tribal” or “traditional,” or if it includes dreads, locs, afros, cornrows or a headdress.

Northern Arizona University’s Housing and Residence Life warned against African-inspired costumes, Pocahontas, Asian rice hats and more, according to The College Fix.

At Princeton University, the Center for Equality held a “dialogue about the impact of cultural appropriation, Halloween, and why culture is not a costume.”

To ensure students don't make the wrong choice, The University of Southern Indiana hosted a workshop for students to make their own “culturally appropriate” costumes, as reported by The College Fix.

Meanwhile, Minnesota State University Moorhead is set to have a panel discussion called “Not Your Festival Wear: Fashion and Cultural Appropriation” that asks how “appropriation is fueled by women’s fashions and ‘white feminism.’"" Vanderbilt University Residential Education, in collaboration with Vanderbilt Feminists, is hosting a chat on cultural appropriation “just in time for Halloween.”

Texas A&M University held a cultural appropriation diversity workshop earlier this month, and the University of New Hampshire took it a step further, hosting an entire cultural appropriation “teach in” not only aimed at Halloween, but also Cinco de Mayo and Dia de los Muertos.

At Tufts University, students were warned they could be subject to probes from campus police for costumes that make students “feel threatened or unsafe.” Administration officials encouraged students to report anyone wearing an “inappropriate and offensive costume,” according to the College Fix. Examples include geishas, Native Americans, Confederate soldiers or anything involving wearing blackface and/or a sombrero.

The University of Texas issued a 29-point checklist on offensive Halloween costumes that said even “seemingly harmless themes can be carried out incorrectly,” and the bias response team asked students to report any “party with a racist theme.”

A Greek official at Pennsylvania’s Gettysburg College went so far as to warn fellow Greeks their chapters could be shut down if they wear the wrong costumes.

The University of Florida offered 24/7 counseling last year around Halloween.

“Some Halloween costumes reinforce stereotypes of particular races, genders, cultures, or religions,” the administration wrote. “Regardless of intent, these costumes can perpetuate negative stereotypes, causing harm and offense to groups of people.”","Universities issue guides, threats and counseling for 'offensive' Halloween costumes",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/24/universities-issue-guides-threats-and-counseling-for-offensive-halloween-costumes.html

It’s not often that MSNBC ends up aiding President Trump, but it did so this time, boosting the argument for a border wall.","The Russian nuclear deal continues to be kept under containment by media fearful that it might contaminate their ability to attack President Trump.

In the latest development, The Hill reported that, an FBI informant was cleared to testify on the issue. “The Justice Department on Wednesday night released a former FBI informant from a confidentiality agreement, allowing him to testify before Congress about what he witnessed while undercover about the Russian nuclear industry’s efforts to win favorable decisions during the Obama administration,” the newspaper said.

None of the broadcast networks mentioned this development through Thursday evening. That’s not surprising. Hillary Clinton told C-SPAN earlier in the week that the latest allegations were “the same baloney they’ve been peddling for years.” And the media typically take their cues from top Democrat lawmakers.



“Face the Nation” moderator John Dickerson did end the network blackout of the story Sunday. His CBS report was the first of ABC, CBS and NBC to note the scandal that other outlets have tried hard to discredit. Those 69 seconds continue to be the only mention of the story.

That’s especially humorous given all the other stuff networks have time for, especially quirky stories. According to a Newsbusters analysis (hint: where I work): “The networks' blackout is all the more striking given the airtime those shows have already devoted this year to wacky conspiracy theories and urban legends, including the disappearance of Amelia Earhart, the Loch Ness monster, alien abductions, ghosts and even ‘lizard people.’”

That’s 4 minutes, 11 seconds – or nearly four times as much coverage – for the Loch Ness Monster compared to this scandal. And, even if you don’t like the story, it is notable because of all the other media coverage of Russia – 1,000 minutes on Trump-Russia collusion in 2017.

2. Sex Harassment Claims Increase: Claims of sexual harassment and assault are sweeping through the media. Two major names joined the growing list of those accused – NBC and MSNBC Senior Political Analyst Mark Halperin and prominent liberal and long-time New Republic Literary Editor Leon Wieseltier.

CNN broke the Halperin story with a damning lede: “Veteran journalist Mark Halperin sexually harassed women while he was in a powerful position at ABC News, according to five women who shared their previously undisclosed accounts with CNN and others who did not experience the alleged harassment personally, but were aware of it.” According to Axios, Halperin lost his TV gig, as well as a book and a TV deal.

The allegations are disturbing. “Three of the women who spoke to CNN described Halperin as, without consent, pressing an erection against their bodies while he was clothed. Halperin denies grabbing a woman's breasts and pressing his genitals against the three women,” according to CNN.

Halperin apologized for having pursued relationships with coworkers, “including some junior” to him. He is also known for authoring the book “Game Change” about the 2008 presidential election, which was later turned into a movie. He had just returned to the NBC universe earlier this year.

New Republic’s Wieseltier was set to head up a new magazine named Idea before sexual harassment allegations surfaced. According to Politico: “Wieseltier was also accused of ‘workplace harassment’ on an anonymous list (of men working in the media) circulating … that’s having reverberations in the industry.”

Wieseltier issued a formal apology: “For my offenses against some of my colleagues in the past I offer a shaken apology and ask for their forgiveness.”

HuffPost also targeted Wieseltier in a story headlined: “‘I Was Blind And Complicit and Just, Like, Did Nothing’: New Republic Staffers Speak Out.”

That article indicated the allegations were years in the making. “Soon after the long-whispered allegations concerning Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein came to light, former editors and writers at The New Republic, a 103-year-old political magazine, started emailing each other to share decades of stories about Leon Wieseltier, the magazine’s longtime literary editor.”

Those are far from the only new incidents in media. Director James Toback has more than 200 accusations against him. Celebrity photographer Terry Richardson and tech blogger Robert Scoble were two of the lesser names to be accused.

There were also celebrity accusers. Former “Hercules” actor Kevin Sorbo complained he had been harassed by the late fashion designer Gianni Versace.

Oddly, in this time of heightened awareness of harassment, TV host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted a picture of herself ogling the breasts of singer Katy Perry. DeGeneres, who came out as gay 20 years ago, commented above the photo, “Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!” She was much criticized on social media after the posting.

3. Flake-y News Coverage: Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake announced he wouldn’t be seeking re-election in 2018 and skewered President Trump in the process. Naturally, the media loved it. Lefty Slate described it as “Sen. Jeff Flake Announces Retirement in Scorching Speech Against Trump.” One thing notably absent from most of the coverage was how Flake was unlikely to win his primary challenge.

News outlets celebrated yet another Trump opponent and used the opportunity to talk about the left’s favorite issue – impeaching or removing Trump from office. “CBS This Morning” co-host Norah O’Donnell asked Flake on air about Trump: “If he is dangerous to democracy, as you say, should he be removed from office?”

Journalists lined up to compliment Flake for attacking their Public Enemy No. 1 – President Trump. CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin called Flake’s comments “extraordinary” and Politics Editor Mark Preston called it “historic.”

Preston then went on to treat Flake’s attack on President Trump like Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. “This is the type of speech that, I think, tomorrow that should be shown, should be listened to by every high school civics class, politics class, history class and the reason being is we're at a moment in time right now where there's so much divisiveness in the country,” he urged.

MSNBC pretend-conservative Joe Scarborough was thrilled by the speech, talking about the dangers of “a tyrannical president.” Then he went on a typical rant blaming Trump for the end of the GOP, saying: “What we’re seeing here is the – it’s political suicide. It's the coming end of the Republican Party where you are losing guys who are temperamentally moderate.” That last part is, no doubt, intended to include Scarborough, who used to be considered conservative but makes millions from MSNBC not to be.

4. CNN, MSNBC and Media Fails: Into every life a little rain must fall. That applies to news outlets as well. Both CNN and MSNBC had thoroughly humorous incidents this week in their quest to lead the anti-Trump resistance.

CNN produced a silly anti-Trump commercial about facts that used bananas and apples to teach the press that CNN stands behind them. “This is an apple. Some people might try to tell you that it’s a banana,” the segment begins, pretending that CNN only tells its viewers facts.

Both Daily Caller and BuzzFeed mightily mocked the commercial with the Caller adding to the CNN “Facts First” tagline: “UNLESS WE ARE REPORTING ON TRUMP.” The Blaze’s Dana Loesch won the Twitter commentary wars by snarking: “But what if it’s an apple that identifies as a banana.”

MSNBC had its own embarrassment. Reporter Jacob Soboroff went to the U.S.-Mexico border as three illegal immigrants jumped over the fence. It’s not often that MSNBC ends up aiding President Trump, but it did so this time, boosting the argument for a border wall.

5. Hurray for Hollywood: It’s a tough battle in Tinseltown this week over which star can say the most idiotic thing. First, there’s sometime comedian Kathy Griffin, fresh from hacking a phony Trump head. Now she’s angry at those who abandoned her, including CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who she called “The Spineless Heiress.”

Then there’s actress Lena Dunham freaking out that embattled, left-wing ESPN host Jemele Hill followed her on Twitter. “Holy s--- @jemelehill following me is like finding out definitively that God is here and she reads your blog. Fan dance.”

Long-time liberal singer/actor Harry Belafonte made the now-common Trump era comparisons to Nazi Germany, noting that “the country made a mistake and I think the next mistake might very well be the gas chamber and what happened to Jews (under) Hitler is not too far from our door.”

TV entertainment wasn’t much better than the stars. “American Horror Story: Cult” delivered an episode even crazier than usual, deploying a Nazi police officer and an incestuous threesome. Yes, this is broadcast TV.

The CW’s “Supergirl” continues to show its superpower is propaganda. The latest episode depicted Americans as anti-Mexican and anti-gay. The CW’s other superhero show “Legends of Tomorrow” introduced a Muslim superhero from the future. The character was added in a post-election fit of PC pique.","Hillary Clinton's ties to Russian uranium deal largely ignored by anti-Trump media, and other media disasters",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/hillary-clintons-ties-to-russian-uranium-deal-largely-ignored-by-anti-trump-media-and-other-media-disasters.html

Instead of drugs, they’re beaming magnetic pulses deep inside a patient's brain to change the way depression symptoms are perceived. It's called transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS and it's currently FDA approved to treat depression only.

Doctors said it could also prove helpful in a wide range of conditions like schizophrenia, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain, by rewiring a network of signals in the brain.

""What TMS is doing is changing how that network functions, really rebooting the network to improve symptoms of mood, anxiety and chronic pain,” Leuchter said.

Leuchter also said the newest generation of TMS equipment could make treatments less time-consuming. Patients could see treatment sessions cut from 37 minutes to 3 minutes, and can complete a full course in just two weeks.

Several patients treated with TMS for depression said the therapy also helped to relieve their pain, which raises the question about whether TMS could one day become an alternative to opioids.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

But now many of those admirers may be wondering who the real clown is.

After receiving backlash over a 2000 memoir that details his past behavior toward women, Taibbi now says the book was a fictional “satire.”

Taibbi abruptly canceled his scheduled appearance at a humanities festival in Chicago on Saturday after negative reaction to an interview he recently gave to an NPR reporter.

According to Reuters, NPR asked Taibbi about the memoir he co-authored, called “The Exile: Sex, Drugs and Libel in the New Russia.”

The book details the exploits of Taibbi, 47, and another staffer while they worked for an English-language newspaper in Russia.

The memoir includes anecdotes in which Taibbi and co-author Mark Ames seem to have mistreated – possibly even assaulted – some women they encountered in Russia, Reuters reported.

According to an excerpt published by the Chicago Reader, Taibbi and Ames refer to attractive Russian women as being “usually available to the highest bidder,” and often willing to engage in “condomless sex.”

But in a Facebook post last week, Taibbi wrote that the memoir was really fictional and that his intent was to poke fun at the idea of Americans living in Russia.

“I regret many editorial decisions that I made back then, and putting my name as a co-author on a book that used cruel and misogynistic language to describe many people and women in particular,” Taibbi wrote. “I hope readers can forgive my poor judgment at that time.”

Co-author Ames also posted that the book was fictional.

“I never raped, harassed, assaulted anyone, and it sickens me that I’m dragged into having to make this sort of denial,” Ames wrote, according to Reuters.

The Chicago Reader’s Aimee Levitt, however, notes that Twitter users have pointed out that the book contains a note at the beginning, saying it was nonfictional.

“To fail to acknowledge Taibbi's earlier work is to say that what he and Ames wrote about doing didn't matter, how those women felt didn't matter, and, by extension, to say we don't matter, and you, our female readers, don't matter,” Levitt writes. “But we do.

Maybe at one time, but no longer. Now it’s the right to express one’s pain and the duty to attend to the Pain Monster the lies within us.

And the oh-so delicate students at many colleges and universities across the country are eager to share their inner pain with all who will listen – and demand to be sheltered from anything that could cause yet more inner turmoil.

In times past, the college student who tells you of his pain for some imagined slight would have been scolded and mocked for his self-indulgent, bruised feelings. If you’re so thin-skinned, grow thicker skin, we’d have told him. Grow up. But we don’t talk like that anymore.

We’ve been sensitized and disciplined and sued when we talk like that. As a result we’ve grown the wobbliest and most spineless generation the country has ever seen. Bear in mind, I’m talking about the adults administrators and professors at America’s colleges, not the students. The students are just taking their cues from us. When they profit from our indulgence they show themselves braver than we are, if more malevolent.

Through our weakness, through our unwillingness to discipline infantilized behavior, we’ve created the Pain Monsters at Yale University, Middlebury College, Evergreen State College and a growing number of other colleges. We’ve signaled that they can behave as outrageously as they want, so long as they justify themselves by uttering the magic words: “I want to talk about my pain.”

There are few colleges and universities that coddle students more than Yale, and few where students are more privileged. Any 18-year-old accepted there should feel a tremendous sense of gratitude. For many, a Yale degree will open doors to prestigious graduate schools, high-paying jobs, and entry into the ranks of our nation’s wealthy and powerful elite.

But students soon learn better than to be grateful for their good fortune after arriving at Yale. Instead they’re taught to express their hatred for anyone in authority, for anyone who deviates in the slightest way from the latest progressive orthodoxies.

When the head of one residential college at Yale asked students to listen to other views, one of them yelled at him: “Why the f--- did you accept the position? Who the f--- hired you? You should step down!” When the college head patiently replied, the student answered: “You should not sleep at night! You are disgusting!” Students later complained that they were so traumatized by the college head that that they were having breakdowns.

Incidentally, until last year the title of heads of residential colleges at Yale was “master.” But that title – taken from the “ancient collegiate tradition” at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England – was dropped because it “carries a painful and unwelcome connotation” to slavery and slave owners “that can be difficult or impossible for some students and residential college staff to ignore,” Yale announced in dropping the title.

At other colleges and universities, protesters told conservative speakers: “You’re killing us.” College Republicans were told: “Your existence is a disturbance.”

We see the same thing in the unhinged Trump Derangement protests. On the anniversary of last year’s election next month, tens of thousands of progressives plan to assemble in Boston Common “to scream helplessly at the sky.” I wouldn’t advise anyone to show up in a Make American Great Again cap.

“I want to talk about my pain,” said a student at a Yale protest. It’s easy enough to deride the silly things student protestors say, but I don’t want to deny that the pain was real. We have an infinite capacity to obsess over perceived slights, to turn them into the deepest psychological wounds, and to turn that into boundless hatred.

The interesting question is not whether the pain is real. Rather, the question is why we’re seeing more of it today than in the past. And the answer is because we’ve incentivized pain. We’ve let people know that pain, even idiotic, senseless pain, can be weaponized and employed against hated opponents, whether college teachers or local conservatives. And when you incentivize something, you get more of it.

The pain is real. But it is also strategic. What comes first is the desire to justify one’s hatred, for which the pain operates as a permission slip. It makes the protestor think his hatred noble, and lets him hug himself in self-delight for reveling in the most evil of emotions.

Colleges and universities are meant to be places of learning and intellectual growth, where old assumptions and ideas are challenged – not pain-free zones where delicate sensibilities are coddled and no one is exposed to disturbing or challenging ideas. That’s a lesson we’ve somehow forgotten.","Beware the incredible 'pain monsters' we've created at Yale, Evergreen State, Middlebury and other schools",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/27/beware-incredible-pain-monsters-weve-created-at-yale-evergreen-state-middlebury-and-other-schools.html

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote.

Reuer made headlines earlier this week after revealing she dropped nearly 80 pounds during the last two years and successfully completed a Tough Mudder race in June.

The 67-year-old now weighs 120 pounds but was once 198. She told Fox News on Friday that she started her wellness journey by cutting out carbs, sugar and rice. But her initial goal wasn’t necessarily to lose weight, she said. Rather, the Farmington Hills, Mich. resident just wanted to live a healthier lifestyle.

“I’m one of six siblings, and the other five have significant health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. While I hadn’t developed any of those things, I knew I would if I didn’t change how I was eating,” she said.

She also said her job encouraged her to better her lifestyle. Reuer is the CEO of Dryer Vent Wizard, a dryer vent cleaning service. She described her job as “high-stress.”

“To keep doing it as I get older, I knew I needed to be in a better condition than I was two years ago,” she said.

Just by changing her eating habits, Reuer quickly dropped 50 pounds. “When I started to lose weight, it was fun,” she said.

Even though she was thinner, Reuer said she still felt self-conscious about going to the gym at first -- wary of other gym-goers who might watch or judge her.

When she did start going, “I couldn't do push up or pull ups, and I was sore and tired,” she said.

But Reuer was determined to get stronger-- eventually hiring a personal trainer to help her on her fitness journey. As she slowly built up her strength and stamina, people started to take note.

A month after she started working out, Reuer said that Jason Kapica, the executive vice president of Dryer Vent Wizard, asked her to take part in a Tough Mudder race-- a 10 to 12 mile endurance race where participants run, scale walls, climb ropes, and more. Kapica wanted to raise money for the Children’s Burn Foundation, bit was hesitant at first to enter the competition.

“I told him I’ve never done anything like that,” she said. “I thought it was funny he even asked.”

Reuer told Kapica that she would support him and the company would sponsor him-- but she wasn’t going to take part.

But her outlook changed when she thought about the children she would be helping by participating in the race. While working with her trainer one day, Reuer made it official.

“My trainer looked at me and said, ‘OK-- we have some work to do.’”

For the next nine months, Reuer went to the gym six days a week. As the race got closer, she went two times a day, six days a week.

“I just kept thinking about trying to help these kids,” Reuer said.

Before she knew it, it was race day.

“I remember thinking: ‘What am I doing here?’” Reuer said. But all her pre-race jitters vanished after she starting running-- successfully taking on many of the obstacles even after a fellow racer told her she looked “too frail” to climb one of the walls.

“I may have white hair, but that’s an assumption I would never make about someone,” she said.

The race may be over, but that’s not stopping Reuer from maintaining her fitness journey. Reuer is still working with a trainer and continues to go to the gym six days a week.

“I’m proud of myself. But I’m happier to see what’s beenhappening around me,” she said.

Reuer said her weight loss has inspired others around her—her husband and many of her employees have embraced their own wellness journeys and lost weight as a result.

In addition, her company now offers free personal trainer sessions to employees. Employees can also use an hour of their work day to go to the gym, she said.

“That has been the most fun thing and has made the proudest,” she said.

As for her next goal? Reuer wants to tackle some of the Tough Mudder obstacles she wasn’t quite strong enough to conquer the first time round, so she plans on participating in the race again this summer. Other than that, she wants to make sure she doesn’t become part of the 65 percent of dieters who eventually return to their pre-diet weight.

The JFK files are out. Well, sort of. After President Donald Trump promised transparency in a tweet earlier in the week, thousands are still being withheld by the government after some were released Thursday night.

On Friday, former CIA officer Mike Baker joined The Tom Shillue Show to explain the continued secrecy.

Baker, who investigated the assassination for his Travel Channel series ""America Declassified"", isn't too surprise by the decision to keep some files secret -- for now. However, he's less suspicious than some who think it's a deep state cover up.

Because the JFK investigation was so large, Baker believes it probably contains sensitive information about seemingly unrelated classified issues and our intelligence gathering tactics.

Baker also is skeptical about the idea there was a major conspiracy behind the assassination. He says it would have been possible for Lee Harvey Oswald to have killed the President by himself.

Sexual harassment occurs when one person chooses to sexually objectify another person. And in a tweet, DeGeneres shared a photo of herself and singer Katy Perry with DeGeneres’ jaw wide open and gawking directly at Perry's breasts. To complete the hypocritical gesture, DeGeneres included this caption:

“Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!”

The real question now is how would DeGeneres have responded if it were a man who did exactly what she did – taking a photo posing with his jaw wide open and head gawking into the breasts of another woman?

How would DeGeneres react if it were a man making the same comments, calling a woman’s breasts “big balloons?” She would no doubt be one of the first people to publicly condemn such an action as being sexist and harassment.

“This is not a male thing or a female thing, it is not a Hollywood thing or a political thing, this is a human thing and it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world and we are all the same,” she said on her TV show in a monologue discussing sexual harassment. “We all want the same thing, we want respect, love and kindness. And if I could have those three things and an iPhone X, I would be complete.”

So how does DeGeneres justify her sexist action?

Is it because she's a woman and she thinks that it's okay for one woman to objectify another woman's body?

Is it because DeGeneres believes that since she is a lesbian she can objectify or make sexual comments about another woman's body?

If you are going to be a social justice warrior Ellen, then you must also be the example. You cannot just bandy words around and argue against sexual harassment, calling for love, respect and kindness for all humans when you are actually the one engaging in the very thing you condemn.

It is exactly these sorts of behaviors that lead the general public to become so exhausted and disgusted by the hypocrisy of Hollywood.

Ellen, don't use an anti-sexual harassment campaign to build yourself up or to widen your audience or to gain more ratings. Do it because you believe in it. And if you believe in it then maintain your integrity and be consistent in your actions. At the very least, you could own up to your sexist actions, apologize and learn from your own mistakes.",Ellen DeGeneres proves she’s a hypocrite with sexist tweet of herself staring at Katy Perry’s breasts,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/ellen-degeneres-proves-s-hypocrite-with-sexist-tweet-herself-staring-at-katy-perry-s-breasts.html

According to a Center for Disease (CDC) report, the number of babies born addicted to opioids has tripled in the U.S. in 15 years.
It won’t be easy, but we can be – and must be – the generation that puts an end to this crisis, and that starts with our politicians in Washington.
“From Pittsburgh to Philadelphia and across central Pennsylvania, families were being torn apart by a heroin epidemic,” he wrote.
I am proud of the work our president and Congress are doing, and will continue to champion, to combat the opioid epidemic.","Last year more than 64,000 Americans in every corner of our country were lost to drug overdoses. That’s 142 people each day.

For too long we have not faced this growing crisis head on. And while we’ve lost so many, we must also remember the innocent children born to addicted parents who are exposed to the dangers of this crisis from their first breath. According to a Center for Disease (CDC) report, the number of babies born addicted to opioids has tripled in the U.S. in 15 years.

It won’t be easy, but we can be – and must be – the generation that puts an end to this crisis, and that starts with our politicians in Washington. Take Pennsylvania, for example, where Sen. Pat Toomey has been on the front lines fighting for increased and more responsible funding of programs to combat this epidemic.

In 2015, Toomey wrote about his experience traveling the state upon being elected and seeing a pattern emerge. “From Pittsburgh to Philadelphia and across central Pennsylvania, families were being torn apart by a heroin epidemic,” he wrote. “More Pennsylvanians will die this year from overdoses and misuse of heroin and opioid painkillers than from influenza or homicide.”

In fact, according to the CDC, three of four new heroin users report abusing opioids before using heroin. In order to stop the cycle of tragedy that Toomey heard about, and that too many people have lived firsthand, we must take action.

The approach President Trump outlined in his speech on Thursday that declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency is holistic and addresses not just the effects of addiction, but also the measures to prevent people from becoming addicted in the first place.

This process starts with educating our kids about the dangers of addiction. The earlier we educate our communities about addiction and the many forms it can take, the more likely we are to prevent people from sliding down that slippery slope.

We must also provide the necessary resources and support to those addicted and those in recovery. Too many relapsed addicts share similar stories of falling back into a cycle of drug abuse by the weight of their past mistakes and inability to re-enter their communities after rehab or incarceration.

Because addiction is a disease, not a moral failing, we must treat it as such.

Until recently, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs almost exclusively treated chronic pain with prescription opioids. Because our nation’s veterans suffer from chronic pain at a rate double the national average, it should be no surprise that this treatment method led to their rates of fatal overdoses also be double the national average.

Our nation’s heroes deserve our very best care, and while the VA has taken steps to curtail the over-prescription of addictive opioids, there is still much work to be done. That’s why Secretary of Veteran’s Affairs David Shulkin visited the Coatesville, Pa., Veterans Affairs Medical Center on Friday to host a roundtable to discuss the successes and continued work being done in the VA to combat the opioid epidemic.

This type of engagement and community discussion is what leads to the policies we’re fighting for in Washington. The conversation must be open and ongoing, but it must also be coupled with action.

Every moment we wait to act, the crisis gets worse.

Since the First World War erupted in 1917, one U.S. Army division has been on activation longest, ready to defend the United States and its freedoms. Known as The Big Red One -- from its distinct arm patch - the First Infantry Division has fought in all major American military campaigns of the last 80 years. In this gripping episode of ""War Stories with Oliver North,"" you'll go inside the battlefields of World War I all the way through Operation Iraqi Freedom with those who proudly served in the Big Red One.

You'll go along with the Division as it returns to Europe 27 years later to take on Hitler's elite Panzer Divisions. In that epic struggle, the fighting First Division took part in three amphibious invasions and five major land battles. Barely 20 years later, in the jungles of Vietnam, The Big Red One continued the fight against Communist insurgents. And during 1991's ""Operation Desert Storm,"" the First Division was chosen to breach Saddam Hussein's defenses and take on the dictator's well-trained Republican Guard in the fight to liberate Kuwait.

In this episode, you'll also learn the story of General Terry Allen, the little known, but beloved commander of The Big Red One during its first battles with Hitler's legions.

Beauty competitions long have been controversial in Egypt, with opposition coming from a wide range of sources, including religious organizations and government officials. Recently, the home of the founder of a beauty contest was set on fire shortly before the event was scheduled to take place.

Now, the subject has moved front and center again, with a member of the parliamentary Human Rights Committee pushing a ban on the Miss Egypt Pageant, which the official condemned as a national security threat.

Solaf Darwish, the parliament member, and several other government officials want more control over pageants if they are to continue, according to published reports.

“Miss Egypt Pageant 2017 has stirred public discontent,” said Darwish to Al-Monitor. “There were videos of the contestants in their bedrooms and in fitting rooms, which does not blend with the values ​​and traditions of Egyptian society.”

Religious organizations also are weighing in, hoping to up the ante against beauty contests.

Al-Azhar’s Senior Scholars Committee, a group whose website says its mission includes carrying “the burden and the responsibility of ‎protecting and preserving the purity, moderation, and modesty of Islam over the ‎centuries,” has expressed total opposition to the basic concept of beauty competitions, saying they violate Sharia laws.

Al-Azhar officials say that the very requirement that beauty contest judges must visually inspect a woman’s body and appearance are in contradiction of Sharia laws.

Darwish has argued that, unlike some critics of the contests, she is not seeking an all-out ban on them, but wants them to be answerable to the government to ensure that they comply with cultural and moral values.

“I only want to temporarily suspend them until the government and the Egyptian parliament agree on mechanisms to regulate them in line with the norms prevailing in Egyptian society and assign a specific ministry to supervise them,” Darwish is quoted as telling Al-Monitor.

Efforts to get a comment from the Egyptian Embassy in Washington D.C. were unsuccessful.

Beauty pageant organizers and winners defend the events, saying they are not just about physical appeal.

Fatima Baker, the beauty pageant organizer whose home was set ablaze, told the Al Arabiya Network that her event was the victim of “a misunderstanding of the contest and its purpose.”

“The contest, which is the first of its kind in Egypt, isn’t just about physical beauty, but also about education, fitness, style, aspirations, knowledge of the Quran and social activism,” she said.

Baker noted that the contest had generated a lot of enthusiasm from Egyptians.

“Suffice it to say that within days we received 250 applications and had to close the registration,” she said. “The winner won’t be selected based on her beauty. The contest is not at all about that. I’m a resident of the Delta region and I’m against showcasing local girls in this way.”",Egyptian government has new crackdown target: beauty contests,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/25/egyptian-government-has-new-crackdown-target-beauty-contests.html

I know that sounds dramatic, but it’s true. If someone figures out your email password, you’re in trouble. Social media? Even worse. Once hackers access your online bank account, they can wreck your finances, and you may feel the repercussions of that break-in for years.

It seems not a week goes by that we don’t hear about another data breach. How do you know if the hackers have your info? Click here to find out whether your email has been hacked or stolen.

Most of us have the wrong idea about passwords. We think they have to be convoluted messes, like F$%Th5l2K!&. This theory — that passwords should be nonsensical and hard to remember — reigned for years.

It started in 2003 with guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which insisted on random combinations of numbers, letters and symbols. The organization’s manager, Bill Burr, spread this gospel for years. But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he admitted that this wasn’t nearly as effective as he’d thought.

Thanks to a new round of research, cybersecurity experts have changed their tune. Yes, you should still avoid guessable passwords like “p@ssword1” or “letmein.” But a strong password also can be logical, fluid and easy to remember.

1. Passwords should withstand 100 guesses

This is the most important part: No matter what your password is, it should withstand 100 guesses, which means it shouldn’t be tied to any public information about you or your family.

Hackers often turn to your social media profiles to find information about you, such as your birthday and the name of your pet. And a little data goes a long way. Experts believe criminals can guess the average person's password nearly 73 percent of the time, and they can often access other accounts by using slight variations of the same password.

Facebook is all about making it easy to share your life with your friends and family. Unfortunately, there are some things you shouldn't share online. These bits of information can put you in danger of identity theft, losing your job or causing other major headaches. Click here for five of the biggest offenders you should not put on your profile.

2. Use a phrase

Instead of thinking of your password as a secret code, think of it as a “passphrase.” These are strings of words that are both easy to memorize but hard for anyone else to crack.

Suppose you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, and your favorite color is fuchsia. You have never mentioned these facts online, and only your mom knows such trivia about you. You could compose a passphrase like “ilikefuschiaastronauts.” You’ll never forget it, and the passphrase will confound hackers for (literally) centuries.

I told how to create a great passphrase a little over a year ago, and the advice is still valid. Go here to come up with your own.

3. Go long

You might want to sit down for this one: The new NIST guidelines suggest allowing users to create passwords up to 64 characters long. As if that isn’t weird enough, the guidelines also allow spaces between words. While many people just try to meet the minimum requirement of eight characters, you will get a much stronger password by stretching things out.

You could theoretically create a complex list or sentence, which still makes perfect sense to you. You could list all your pets’ names from childhood, like “fluffy princess rex spike booboo chewie,” or all the streets on the way to your favorite restaurant,

like “academy main washington ohio central.” Easy to remember. Hard to crack.

4. Don’t change your password until you have to

Until recently, consumers were advised to change their passwords every three months. But as NIST’s Paul Grassi recently told the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, “Expiration isn’t a motivator to create a brand-new password, it’s motivation to shift one character so you can remember the password.”

If you’ve created a strong password, then don’t worry about changing it out all the time. Just stick with it unless you’ve been notified of a security breach that requires a password reset.

5. Choose something memorable

Remember, all passwords should be unique, but they don’t have to be cumbersome. NIST calls passwords “memorized secrets.” You want to avoid the temptation to write them down, so pick passwords that mean something to you and will stay in your mind.

I’m not a big fan of password managers. I commit my passwords to memory. But if you cannot do that, here’s a free program that will help you store your passwords safely and easily.

6. Get creative with characters

It may take websites some time to catch up to the latest NIST guidelines, but you can still create a memorable password that meets current restrictions. Go back to Burr’s advice on passphrases. You might choose something like “ArizonaCardinalsfootballisnumber1!” or “Igivemyjob1000%everyday.” Those meet the requirements of having at least eight characters, a special character, and upper and lowercase letters.

7. Use two-factor identification

While passwords help protect your information, cybercriminals are more sophisticated than ever. If they break into your accounts, you may not recognize the damage until it’s too late.

Organizers say the march's goal is to defend Spain's unity and reject ""an unprecedented attack in the history of democracy."" Leaders of rival pro-union parties from the ruling conservatives, the pro-business liberals and the socialists have joined together under the slogan ""We are all Catalonia. Common sense for coexistence!""

Rally organizers Societat Civil Catalana, the leading pro-union grassroots group, said that over 1 million people turned out for the march that maintained a festive mood without any incidents reported. Police haven't yet provided a crowd estimate.

Many demonstrators waving Spanish, Catalan and European Union flags flooded a central boulevard. Some held hand-made signs and banners reading ""We won't let Spain to be torn apart into pieces"" and ""The awakening of a silenced nation.""

CATALONIA PUSHES FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM SPAIN: WHAT TO KNOW

""Catalan leaders have broken the law. The central government has let this situation go for too long, for even 30 or 40 years, thinking that we were never going to arrive to this extreme, but here we are,"" said Angelita Cuesta, a 66-year-old retiree. ""Our society is fractured, there are family members and friends who no longer can talk about politics to avoid conflict.""

Three weeks ago, the same group organized a mass rally that brought hundreds of thousands onto Barcelona's streets. That was by far the largest pro-union show of force in Catalonia in recent years, in contrast to huge rallies by separatists.

""We have organized ourselves late, but we are here to show that there is a majority of Catalans that are no longer silent and that no longer want to be silenced,"" Societat Civil Catalana president Alex Ramos said.

Members of Spain's central government, including Health Minister Dolors Montserrat, and Enric Millo, who is Madrid's representative in Catalonia, also attended Sunday's rally. No major pro-independence marches were expected.

Catalonia's separatist leader, who was fired along with his regional government on Saturday, has called for Catalans to engage in peaceful opposition to Spain's crackdown to keep the country together.

The vote by pro-independence lawmakers Friday in favor of secession, and Madrid's response triggering unprecedented constitutional powers taking control of Catalan affairs, was the climax of Spain's worst political crisis in decades.

DEFAINT CATALAN LEADER CALLS FOR PEACEFUL PROTESTS

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy also dissolved Catalonia's parliament and called a new regional election for Dec. 21.

Separatists only won 48 percent of the vote in Catalonia in the last regional election in 2015, although they took more seats because of Spanish election law which gives more weight to sparsely populated areas.

The top politicians for pro-union parties wanted to use Sunday's rally as a launchpad for the critical elections in just over six weeks.

""It's time to take over the streets and take over the ballot boxes,"" said Albert Rivera, the leader of the center-right Citizens party.

Oriol Junqueras, the ousted vice president of Catalonia's rebellious government, wrote in an open letter in Catalan newspaper El Punt-Avui on Sunday that separatists should consider participating in the elections. That was in response to some secessionists who argue to boycott them.

The Catalan parliament's vote to secede came after an illegal Oct. 1 referendum in Catalonia in favor of independence. Spain's constitutional court had outlawed the vote, and local opponents to secession had boycotted the process after separatists violated parliament rules to push through its convocation.

Voting on the day itself was marred by violence when national police clashed with people attempting to cast their ballots, in what was widely seen in the region as a heavy-handed response by Spanish police. But Spain's government said that the police response was proportionate to the resistance that officers met.

SPAIN TAKES OVER CATALONIA, FIRES DEFIANT SEPARATIST LEADERS

Ousted Catalan president Carles Puigdemont issued a televised message Saturday saying that he and other regional officials fired by Madrid would keep ""working to build a free country."" His comments were a veiled refusal to accept his Cabinet's dismissal as ordered by central authorities.

Following their official dismissal, Puigdemont and the 12 members who until Saturday made up the Catalan Cabinet are no longer paid.

Spain's government has said they could be charged with usurping others' functions if they refuse to obey, which could throw the region into further turmoil by prolonging a monthlong standoff.

Separately, a Belgian government official said Sunday it would be ""not unrealistic"" for Puigdemont to ask for asylum, and warned it would create serious diplomatic difficulties with fellow European Union member state Spain.

Asylum State Secretary Theo Francken said on Twitter that ""it is possible to ask for asylum as an EU subject"" in Belgium, adding it was up to independent asylum authorities whether to grant it.

The 28-nation EU is considered a bloc where the rule of law applies and granting asylum based on arguments that repression would endanger the full exercise of one's rights would be exceptional.

""If you assess the situation at this stage, including the prison terms and the repression from Madrid,"" Francken told VTM network, ""there is the question whether a person like that can get a fair trial, of course.""

In another tweet, he stressed Belgium wasn't seeking such a scenario. ""I am not rolling out the welcome mat,"" he said.

In the past, some Basque separatists have asked for asylum in Belgium and weren't extradited to Spain, causing years of friction.

Alexandra Leigh Carter, of Toowoomba, Queensland, says she purchased the makeup kit at the Australian supermarket chain Woolworths — and even tested it out on her son’s wrist for 20 minutes — before applying the product to his face during a “trial run” ahead of Halloween.

“This was only on him for 3 minutes and then had to immediately take him for a shower,” she wrote alongside photos of her little boy with redness and irritation on his face. “It has severely burnt his skin.”

WOMAN WITH MEDICAL CONDITION SHAMED FOR BABY BUMP

Carter says she shared the post to warn other parents to thoroughly test the makeup products their kids plan to use on Halloween. But she also called for the product to be discontinued, and called it “rubbish.”

“I've had his face painted countless time [sic], though whatever is in your product is horrific,” she wrote.

In the comments, Carter further explained that the ordeal “absolutely scared the hell out of both of us,” leading her son to ask if his would be scarred forever. Thankfully, she confirmed the redness died down, and that there doesn't appear to be any lasting marks on his face.

INFAMOUS 'THONG JEANS' ARE NOW A HALLOWEEN COSTUME

“Not even the most conscious of mums can avoid something like this from happening when you purchase products intended for children,” she said, adding that she didn’t make an “informed choice” when purchasing the cheap product. “I made a mistake unfortunately and THANKFULLY never put it on my youngest son as he does have adverse reactions.”

Carter claims she was offered a $25 gift card as compensation for the incident. She also wrote that Woolworths has been “nothing but helpful and apologetic,” though she is still waiting to hear the results of their investigation into the makeup product.

In the meantime, she says, she’ll be comparing the product’s ingredients to others on the market.

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

“I started out doing comedy,” Mills told Fox News.
But I didn’t think I was anything extraordinary to him… About a week later I got a call saying [I] got this movie with Clint Eastwood.
“Knots Landing” is still recognized as the second longest-running drama in TV history.
And that’s good or it would’ve killed ya if you worked every day.”And the relationships Mills developed with her “Knots Landing” family endured.","Donna Mills, who once lured audiences across the country as scheming vixen Abby Cunningham on “Knots Landing,” is returning to her comedic roots.

The 76-year-old television star is starring in the upcoming film “Best Mom” as Nana, a determined parent who seems to fail every time there is an opportunity to talk with her daughter. Some fans may see the movie as a far cry from the “Dallas” spinoff, which aired from 1979 until 1993, but Mills insisted the role was the right fit.

“I started out doing comedy,” Mills told Fox News. “The first thing I did here in Los Angeles when I first came was a show called ‘The Good Life’ with Larry Hagman. It was a half-hour comedy. It was great. I loved Larry and we had a great time together.

""The show only ran one season, mainly because it was opposite of ‘All in the Family.’ That was getting all the ratings. But then I was offered every comedy series that came along, and I didn’t want to get known as a comedy actress. So I turned everything down and waited for some drama. And I think people forget that I do comedy.”

However, just before Mills embarked on comedy, the aspiring actress starred in a 1971 thriller titled “Play Misty for Me,” which featured a first-time director, actor Clint Eastwood. Burt Reynolds, who previously worked with Mills in the 1970 series “Dan August,” was so impressed by the guest star that he recommended her to Eastwood, who instantly hired Mills for his directorial debut.

“I got along great with Burt,” recalled Mills. “We had a really good time. But I didn’t think I was anything extraordinary to him… About a week later I got a call saying [I] got this movie with Clint Eastwood.

""[But] apparently, Burt and Clint ran into each other at a bar one night. Clint told him, ‘I can’t find a girl I really like for this movie that I’m going to direct.’ And Burt was like, ‘I just worked with this girl… Maybe you would like her… Clint hired me from that. I never met him, I never read for him, audition — nothing… I’m always grateful for Burt.”

Mills revealed Eastwood easily impressed her with his determination to show off his directorial skills, despite already being celebrated as a Hollywood icon.

“He never directed before, so one would have thought he wouldn’t [know] what he was doing,” explained Mills. “But no, he knew exactly what he wanted… He was amazing. Absolutely amazing… He finished the movie under budget and under time… Over-budget is what you generally hear in Hollywood… I think he’s a born director, I really do. I think it was bubbling in him all the time when he was doing all the Westerns. He was just taking it all in and learning. Once he started to direct, he just took off.”

By the time “Knots Landing” came along, Mills was viewed by as “Miss Goody Two Shoes” and was eager to shed her innocent image. Even though Mills was friends with one of the show’s producers, she wanted to audition for the role of Abby and prove she was capable of playing a bad girl. The move worked, but the character would quickly impact her life when cameras stopped rolling.

“It was funny, I didn’t realize it at first,” said Mills. “When I played Abby, whenever I would meet people, a lot of the times they were kind of standoffish to me. I thought, ‘What did I do?’ I’m friendly, I’m usually pretty nice. I [didn’t] know why they were standoffish to me. So cold. And I learned — they thought I was like Abby. They thought I was Abby. So they were worried I was going to somehow do something bad to them. Steal their husbands, I don’t know. And so, I really had to fight hard to overcome that in real life.”

Still, Mills earned lasting success from the popular series. “Knots Landing” is still recognized as the second longest-running drama in TV history. She credited the show’s 14-hour work days for giving the cast flexibility to share their finest performances for viewers.

“A normal day was 14 hours, sometimes it would be 16 and on a Friday it would be 18,” said Mills. “[Quality] was the most important thing to everybody. And that had to be done right… That all takes time. The lighting, rehearsal, everything. And we never rushed it.

""We always took as much time as we needed to make it as good as we possibly could… We were happy to do it, but it was tough. It was grueling. It was exhausting… But it was a large cast, so not everyone worked every day. And that’s good or it would’ve killed ya if you worked every day.”

And the relationships Mills developed with her “Knots Landing” family endured. She still stays in touch with the cast and is even considering a secret project with two former cast mates. As for a possible “Knots Landing” reboot, Mills isn’t sure if it will ever happen, but she would happily take on Abby again if asked.

“Absolutely,” she said. “That was a once in a lifetime character… I would absolutely do it in a heartbeat. If it were up to me, I would say yes [to a reboot]. I think it would be fascinating to see where those characters are today and what they’ve experienced over the years. I think it would be fun to find out.”

But Mills isn’t sitting back and waiting. She has not slowed down since the show’s finale and is eager to do comedy again with ""Best Mom.""

“I’ve always had a lot of energy and discipline, having been a dancer,” said Mills. “But while I was raising my daughter, I didn’t work a lot mainly because I would have had to go out of town… I wasn’t going to leave her at any given amount of time to be somewhere. But once she went off to college, a bunch of stuff just fell on my lap… And I’m at a point right now where I love working. I really do. I have fallen in love with it again.”","'Knots Landing' star Donna Mills talks new comedy role, impressing Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/24/knots-landing-star-donna-mills-talks-new-comedy-role-impressing-burt-reynolds-and-clint-eastwood.html

Moore, the director of several documentaries including ""Roger and Me,"" ""Bowling for Columbine,"" and ""Farenheit 9/11,"" responded later Saturday with a tweet of his own.

Moore's show, ""The Terms of My Surrender,"" ended its 13-week run Oct. 22. The website BroadwayWorld.com reported that it took in $4.2 million at the box office, less than half of its potential take.

The show, which combined Moore's autobiography with calls for political action against Trump and other Republicans, was a critical disappointment as well. The New York Times described ""Terms of My Surrender"" as ""shaggy and self-aggrandizing.""

""You don’t have to disagree with Mr. Moore’s politics to find that his shtick has become disagreeable with age,"" wrote reviewer Jesse Green, who compared the show to ""being stuck at Thanksgiving dinner with a garrulous, self-regarding, time-sucking uncle.""

Moore has been an outspoken critic of Trump. In August, Moore led the show's audience to Trump Tower to protest the president's reaction to deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. That same night, he compared the president's supporters to accomplices in a rape during an interview with CNN.

""If you hold down the woman while the rapist is raping her, and you didn't rape her, are you a rapist?"" Moore said at the time. ""Let's cut the BS and start speaking honestly.""

This week, Moore told the Wall Street Journal in an email that the show was ""the most artistically gratifying experience of my life"" and said there were ""talks happening about taking this show on the road.""

A Missouri college that has long embraced teaching its students about military history is beginning a new, required course on patriotism.

FOX's Gurnal Scott with the story:

The College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri is a private, Christian, liberal arts school that embraces it's uniqueness in how it values getting ""the job"" done:

(Dr. Davis) ""This is a work college. Kids work here. They don't pay tuition. They don't have to do that. We don't make loans and they graduate debt free. We to turn out citizens that will take a leadership role.""

That is why the college's president Dr. Jerry Davis says part of the school's mission has been teaching students about the military and it's importance historically in America. The College of the Ozarks is making that a new course, mandatory for incoming freshmen, called 'Patriotic Education and Fitness':

(Dr. Davis) ""We think that we need to be a little bit more intentional in teaching students about our country and about the military and what they do and why they do it.""

The course will serve to educate students on armed forces customs and protocols and touch on some political principles as well as teaching marksmanship and other survival techniques. It can serve, should a first-year student choose, as a start for reserve officers training or ROTC. Davis who has led the College of the Ozarks for nearly 30 years says Midwestern reverence for the military makes this a great fit within their curriculum:

(Dr. Davis) ""It's a part of our carrying out our patriotic goal and we think, we hope, that other schools will notice that.""

Davis says this concept couldn't come at a better time as controversy continues in stadiums across the nation over patriotism:

(Dr. Davis) ""I regret very much what's going on in the culture with regard to respect for the national anthem. Those are military students that present those colors and by extension. The country is being provided or defended by the military, so you can't say it doesn't involve the military. It does.""

In fact, the school has said its teams won't compete against other athletes that won't stand for the anthem. That's why Davis wants his school to lead the way in teaching respect for the uniform:

(Dr. Davis) ""Patriotism is not inherited by bloodstream. It must be modeled. It must be modeled, it must be taught.""

So what began as a pilot program, is growing at the College of the Ozarks as a nod to those who serve and to America itself.

The bill aims to solidify the city's Jewish majority, but stops short of formal annexation, making the practical implications unclear. The bill says the communities would be considered ""daughter municipalities"" of Jerusalem.

The Palestinians claim both east Jerusalem and the West Bank, territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war, as part of their future state, a position that has wide international backing. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally.

Israel's Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as saying Israel needs to coordinate the bill with the U.S.

""The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth (to continue) talking and coordinating with them. We are working to promote and develop the settlement enterprise,"" it quoted Netanyahu as saying at a government meeting Sunday.

Earlier Sunday, David Bitan, the Likud party's parliamentary whip and a close Netanyahu ally, told Army Radio the vote was delayed because ""there is American pressure claiming this is annexation.""

Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group, says the bill would amount to ""de facto annexation"" and be a clear step toward full annexation of the West Bank.

U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy, Jason Greenblatt, has been shuttling throughout the region in hopes of restarting peace talks, which last collapsed in 2014.

But in contrast to the Obama administration, Trump has not explicitly endorsed a Palestinian state. He also has shown some tolerance for settlement construction, urging Israel to show restraint but saying a complete halt is unnecessary.

Israel says the fate of the settlements, home to more than 600,000 Israelis, should be decided through peace talks along with other core issues like security.","Under US pressure, Israel delays move to expand Jerusalem",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/29/israel-delays-move-to-expand-jerusalem-over-us-pressure.html

Witnesses told authorities the car Bankhead was driving suddenly turned slowed down, before it was positioned toward the cliff and accelerated.

Officials said they found nothing mechanically wrong with the vehicle but were unable to recover information from a water-damaged device on the vehicle that records speed, acceleration and braking.

The Ada County Sheriff's Office cited witness statements and lack of skid marks in making its determination that Bankhead acted deliberately. Toxicology tests found no medication or alcohol in Bankhead's system.

Patrick Orr, a spokesperson with the sheriff’s department, declined to comment on Bankhead's motive.

Officials said the mother had gone through a divorce about two years before the crash. She worked full-time as a paralegal and legal secretary for more than 20 years. Her children were described as active and curious with various interests and hobbies.

Born in August nearly 15 weeks early, Evans spent every possible moment at their side.

Late in the evening, Evans said goodbye to the girls and began the drive home to her husband, Jacob, and their four young sons. Less than a mile from home, Evans was involved in a crash too horrific for description. Although the investigation is still underway, the other driver was allegedly intoxicated.

It is believed Evans died instantly.

Interviewed by phone, Evans’s husband, Jacob, described the longest and most agonizing night of his life. When his wife hadn’t returned home in a reasonable amount of time, he became worried. After calls to friends and the hospital, he drove the route she would’ve taken home and in a matter of minutes was face to face with a police barricade.

The next few hours marched by like exhausted soldiers. Friends and members of his church family filled his home until finally, at 5:30 a.m., the coroner knocked on his door with one hand and held Katie’s driver’s license with the other.

“The first thing I thought was how do I tell my boys,” Evans said. Later that morning, when the moment was right, Evans gathered the three older boys for a family meeting. Evans led a discussion about God’s plan for his children. “Then I told them that God had asked them to exercise faith in (his) plan. I said their mother had been killed. The boys cried their little hearts out and I was so glad to have so many friends there to hug and hold them.”

As Evans considers his wife’s legacy, he knows it’s rooted in forgiveness. He has no doubt Katie would want friends and family to forgive the other driver. Evans says life is too short for anything other than letting go and moving on.

In fact, when he heard that since Katie’s passing some within his company were expressing anger and frustration, Evans wrote an open letter to the employees. It read:

“Obviously this is a difficult time for me and my family. It has been more difficult as I have heard that some are angry with the driver who killed my wife. Katie would not have wanted that. She was the embodiment of compassion. The hateful activities reported in the news recently troubled her greatly. She felt there was already too much anger in the world. I want you to know that I forgive the driver of that accident. Of course I am sorry that it happened. Of course I wish I could go back in time and change it, but we are all best served by moving forward with today’s reality and the best way to move forward is to honor Katie’s memory and focus on how to take care of her six children. Trials and tribulation are mandatory. Misery is optional. Happiness is a choice, sometimes a difficult choice. I confess I feel little in the way of happiness at the moment, but I am determined to be as happy as I can be and for now that is found in my profound gratitude to a generous and supportive community for the love they have wrapped around me and my family during this challenging time.”

As our interview ended, I asked Jacob Evans what final message he had for my readers. “Katie wasn’t perfect. No one is. But if you want to honor Katie, do what she did every day of her life. Go find a way to make the world a little better.”

And what better way to start than exercising a little forgiveness.","Katie Evans, loving mom killed in car crash following visit of premature twins leaves behind beautiful legacy",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/katie-evans-loving-mom-killed-in-car-crash-following-visit-premature-twins-leaves-behind-beautiful-legacy.html

The Cosmograph Daytona was given to Newman by his wife, actress Joanne Woodward, in 1968 while the two were working on the car racing film “Winning” with Robert Wagner.

Woodward had the message “Drive Carefully Me” engraved on the back of the watch.

The stainless steel watch features a crocodile strap and can be seen in countless photos of Newman, who became a serious racing car driver himself thanks to his experience making the movie.

Cox described wearing it as “magical,” but put it away in recent years as its value rose.

It certainly was magical when it was on the block at the Phillips auction in New York, where it garnered an opening bid of $10 million and ended up going for $15.5 million to an anonymous phone bidder who will pay a total of $17,752,500 after fees.

With the help of Aira smart glasses and a customer support representative, these brothers are getting a sense of what is going on all around them thanks to new amazing technology made specifically for the blind. The representative, also known as a trained agent, describes to the user of the glasses what they are seeing in real-time.

The brothers are being given a free year subscription to the software as they get ready to head off to college next year. They thought the glasses were cool as they got a chance to hear what their eyes cannot see.

On Wednesday, the 100-year-old veteran got his recognition and finally his money, too.

Almeda received the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin also announced at a Capitol ceremony that Almeda was getting a check, 72 years after the war ended.

Shulkin's announcement drew gasps from some of the hundreds in attendance at the Gold Medal ceremony, which House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged was ""long, long overdue.""

Almeda, dressed in his military cap, told the crowd he was glad to be able to accept the medal, noting that ""many have passed away waiting for 75 years for this time to come.""

Almeda said he and other Filipino veterans have long ""felt unrecognized for fighting for our country,"" adding, ""I wondered why"" since he and his fellow soldiers had brought ""victory during a long war in the Philippines.""

The gold medal signified that his service — and that of thousands of other Filipino veterans — is recognized, Almeda said, calling himself a warrior who ""will never quit.""

Almeda was a 24-year-old teacher when he joined the Philippine Commonwealth Army in 1941. After the war, he resumed his career as a teacher and was granted U.S. citizenship in the 1990s. In 2003, he began receiving medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs under a law aimed at Filipino veterans.

But Almeda, now 100 and living outside Washington, has been fighting for nearly a decade to receive a $15,000 lump-sum payment promised to Filipino veterans under the 2009 economic stimulus law.

Almeda was among more than 250,000 Filipino soldiers who served alongside U.S. soldiers in World War II, including more than 57,000 who died. After the war ended, President Harry S. Truman signed laws that stripped away promises of benefits and citizenship for Filipino veterans.

Only recently have the veterans won back some concessions and acknowledgment, including the gold medal.

Ryan said the Capitol ceremony was more than ""a feel-good story of delayed recognition. We are here to immortalize the legacy of great liberators, who have paved the way for generations to follow.""

The ceremony — and the gold medals — should ""serve to ensure that those who fought for freedom are never forgotten, and always remembered,"" Ryan said.

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said Filipino veterans enlisted for World War II ""knowing full well that the enemy could discover who they were and retaliate against their families.""

Even after their service ""was practically erased from American records ... these veterans never gave up,"" Hirono said. ""They organized and fought for what they had earned.""

In 1990, Congress awarded U.S. citizenship to thousands of Filipino veterans and later extended VA benefits to them. The 2009 stimulus law authorized the lump-sum payments, although in some cases missing or poor records blocked the payments from being made.

""After bravely serving our country, it is frankly shameful that these veterans had to fight so hard for what they were promised,"" Hirono said.

Today, only 18,000 Filipino veterans are still alive.

""We are living in tumultuous times, and we have many disagreements,"" Hirono said, ""but we agree that it is our responsibility as public servants and Americans to honor each veteran in the same way they honored our country.""",Filipino WWII veterans awarded Congressional Gold Medal,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/25/filipino-wwii-veterans-awarded-congressional-gold-medal.html

The confirmation this week that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid an opposition-research firm for a “dossier” on Donald Trump is bombshell news. More bombshells are to come.

We now know where Fusion got some of its cash, but the next question is how the firm used it. With whom did it work beyond former British spy Christopher Steele ? Whom did it pay? Who else was paying it?

The answers are in Fusion’s bank records. Fusion has doggedly refused to divulge the names of its clients for months now, despite extraordinary pressure. So why did the firm suddenly insist that middleman law firm Perkins Coie release Fusion from confidentiality agreements, and spill the beans on who hired it?

Because there’s something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more than the Clinton-DNC news—and that something is in those bank records. The release of the client names was a last-ditch effort to appease the House Intelligence Committee, which issued subpoenas to Fusion’s bank and was close to obtaining records until Fusion filed suit last week. The release was also likely aimed at currying favor with the court, given Fusion’s otherwise weak legal case. The judge could rule as early as Friday morning.

If the House wins, don’t be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.’s office.

FBI bombshells are also yet to come. The bureau has stonewalled congressional subpoenas for documents related to the dossier, but that became harder with the DNC-Clinton news. On Thursday Speaker Paul Ryan announced the FBI had finally pledged to turn over its dossier file next week.

Love said he is very apologetic and said this sort of thing hasn't happened since they have been in business.

According to FOX40, the business has no open complaints with the Better Business Bureau or the California Cemetery and Funeral Bureau, where their license is in good standing.

But Goodsell says, after this mix-up, she's still not sure how she can trust that the second set of remains, which she received earlier Saturday, are really those of her brother.

“We all have the same feeling. Is this really my brother.

The great irony of all this though, is that the Clintons started the so-called Russian collusion scandal, and in the end, they may be the ones destroyed by it.","The Left has been desperately working for months to find any shred of evidence that Donald Trump had even the slightest connection to Russia during the presidential campaign. Despite having the full support of their friends in the media, they have consistently failed to find anything substantive.

At first, I assumed the liberal elites were simply driven by their inability to accept that the American people elected Donald Trump as their 45th president. Now, I have another theory: The Trump-Russia story is meant to serve as a pure distraction aimed at masking real corruption by the Clinton political machine.

As The Hill reported on Sunday, while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, a Kremlin-linked bank paid her husband, former President Bill Clinton, hundreds of thousands of dollars. Also during her tenure as top diplomat, earlier reports indicate Canadian and Russian business executives directed many millions more to the Clinton Foundation. In fact, citing recently unsealed Federal Bureau of Investigation reports, The Hill described a thorough Russian campaign aimed at gaining access to the Clintons and capitalizing on their influence, while also spying on them to advance a pro-Russia agenda. In 2010, the FBI arrested 10 so-called “sleeper cell” Russian spies who had reportedly become too close to Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, while serving as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also overseeing a laundry list of U.S.-Russian initiatives and dealings.

Among other things, she served on the Committee on Foreign Investment, where she voted in favor of President Obama’s approval of the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian business, to a state-owned Russian nuclear energy outfit. At the time, the Canadian company controlled 20 percent of the U.S. uranium reserves.

Before the sale was approved, a Kremlin-linked bank that supported the deal paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a 90-minute speech in Moscow to promote the Uranium One’s stock. Bill then met personally with Vladimir Putin. All the while, people linked with Uranium One – and its previous incarnation UrAsia – reportedly paid the Clinton Foundation $145 million in donations.

You can’t make this stuff up, and while the news media continues to acknowledge the facts, they still claim there is no foul play on behalf of the Clintons in terms of the uranium deal. The Media Research Center found that the ABC, NBC, and CBS evening shows have “spent only 3 minutes and 1 second on the Clinton Foundation scandal in more than two years.”

In comparison, another Media Research Center report found that since Inauguration Day evening shows on these three networks have aired “1,000 minutes of coverage discussing Russia’s attempt to boost Trump in 2016, and speculation that Trump’s campaign may have colluded with the Russians in this project.”

And remember: The so-called collusion story came out of supposed opposition research we now know was funded by Clinton and her Democrat allies.

Thankfully, House and Senate Republicans have now launched new investigations into the Clintons’ ties to Russia – as well as Hillary’s illegal use of a private email server as Secretary of State. The email scandal is now even more significant given that we know that she continued to use a private, insecure email server despite the FBI arresting a ring of Russian agents who were specifically targeting her.

As I told Sean Hannity on Monday, I think we are on the edge of the greatest corruption scandal in American history.

The first thing Congress should do is demand that every single dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation and its charity initiatives be made public to show exactly where the Clintons derived their money. I suspect there are millions of foreign dollars hidden away in foreign subsidiaries that were never reported in financial disclosures.

The truth about the level of foreign donation, influence peddling, and outright corruption involved in the Clinton world could change American politics forever.

The source said both Manafort and his wife were asleep when FBI agents entered the Alexandria, Va., condo without warning at about 6 a.m.
The FBI raid came the same week Manafort appeared before the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees and provided documents on a voluntary basis.
Asked for comment, Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni referred Fox News to a statement released earlier this month: ""FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort's residences.
The officials said a guiding principle for federal agents seeking records is to use the least intrusive means possible.","The FBI’s July raid on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's Virginia home lasted 10 hours and involved a dozen federal agents, who seized documents labeled “attorney-client,” according to a source close to the investigation.

The July raid was first reported earlier this month, but the new details reflect the intensity and scope of the search, which the source described as ""heavy-handed, designed to intimidate."" Elements of the account were backed up by a second individual also not authorized to speak on the record.

The source said both Manafort and his wife were asleep when FBI agents entered the Alexandria, Va., condo without warning at about 6 a.m. ET. They did not conclude their search until late afternoon, around 4 p.m. ET. The 1,600-square-foot condo includes three bedrooms and a main living area.

During the raid, agents copied the electronics through a process known in law enforcement circles as ‘mirroring’ and collected records -- including several documents marked ""attorney-client"" that included privileged material to aid Manafort's preparation for congressional testimony, sources said.

The FBI raid came the same week Manafort appeared before the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees and provided documents on a voluntary basis.

""This is an unusual step, there is no getting around it,"" former Justice Department official Tom Dupree told Fox News. ""It is an aggressive step. I think it sends a very strong message both to Manafort himself and potentially other people who might be targets of this investigation that [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller is going to pursue this aggressively.""

Dupree, who served as principal deputy assistant attorney general during the George W. Bush administration and argued appeals in all 13 circuits as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, drew attention to the timing. ""This is unusual because ordinarily, if you are in the process of testifying before Congress and turning documents over to Congress, you would think the prosecutors might say, 'Well this person is cooperating and there is no need for us to go in and get a search warrant.'""

However, Dupree said, “the fact that Mueller, nonetheless, went in, got a search warrant and raided his home suggests that there is something else going on here … and it suggests that Mueller doesn't trust Manafort or that for whatever reason he thought that if he waited for Manafort to voluntarily comply, that Mueller might not get all the evidence he wanted.""

Asked for comment, Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni referred Fox News to a statement released earlier this month: ""FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort's residences. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well.""

The affidavit that justified to a federal judge that there was ""necessity"" to raid the property – considered a highly visible and aggressive law enforcement tool – remains under seal and is not public.

Two former senior FBI officials, who declined to speak on the record citing the sensitivity of the special counsel case, were split on whether the number of agents appeared excessive given the size of the property and a search that likely authorized a specific range of records. Both officials, with decades of experience at the bureau, emphasized there is ""nothing typical"" about a special counsel probe.

The officials said a guiding principle for federal agents seeking records is to use the least intrusive means possible.

A spokesman for the Special Counsel’s Office declined to comment.

Manafort has been the subject of multiple investigations into his financial dealings and lobbying work. He left the Trump campaign last August amid questions over his dealings in Ukraine; Manafort has since registered as a foreign agent for the work he did with a Ukrainian political party.","FBI's Manafort raid included a dozen agents, 'designed to intimidate,' source says",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/24/fbis-manafort-raid-included-dozen-agents-designed-to-intimidate-source-says.html

McNair's remarks caused a firestorm of criticism from athletes inside and outside the NFL and prompted an initial apology from the 79-year-old Friday.

""I know they were upset,"" McNair told the Houston Chronicle about his meeting with the players. ""I wanted to answer their questions. I told them if I had it to do over again I wouldn't use that expression.""

The comment was published in an ESPN The Magazine story about two recent days of meetings among owners, players and others to discuss the protests that have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump. Players, following the lead of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, say they kneel to protest social injustices, particularly against African-Americans. Trump has sharply criticized the protests and even called on NFL owners to fire players.

The meetings earlier this month did not result in a policy change that would require players to stand for the anthem. Owners and players are expected to meet again next week to discuss initiatives.

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.
Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it.
Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

This isn’t to say that Kansas’ income tax cut could not have been designed better.
Republicans must learn from this and implement simple rules in their tax plan to prevent such gaming of the system.","The growing momentum behind federal tax cuts has defenders of high taxes worried. Witness their decision to start badmouthing Kansas tax cuts.

Tax-and-spend liberals and their media allies are trying to tie President Trump’s tax reform framework to the 2012 tax cuts in Kansas, which browbeaten Republicans largely reversed earlier this year.



“Kansas tried a tax plan similar to Trump’s. It failed,” reads a recent New York Times headline. “A warning to Washington from Kansas,” reads another from CNN. “Kansas abandons massive tax cuts that provided model for Trump’s plan,” says The Guardian.



A closer look at Kansas’ tax cut experience reveals this argument is more style than substance. That’s not to say Republican tax reform advocates in Congress and the White House can’t learn from Kansas – just not the lesson that pro-tax activists are trying to impart.



Some background: In 2012, Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback signed a bill cutting taxes for all state income earners and eliminating them for small businesses that had previously been subject to individual rates. Brownback wanted to give some relief to hardworking taxpayers and boost tepid economic growth.



The fallout, according to media accounts, was near apocalyptic: a “spectacular failure” (Los Angeles Times) that caused “hemorrhaging government revenue” (New York Times).



But looking at objective government figures, the results are far more positive. According to Census Bureau data, Kansas’ total tax revenues actually rose in 2012, the year the tax cut took effect, to $7.4 billion – a 9 percent increase from $6.8 billion in 2011. Revenues grew further to $7.6 billion in 2013.



How can reality be so different from rhetoric? Well, it’s true that Kansas’ total tax revenue dipped to $7.3 billion in 2014, largely due to the commodity price crash and fiscal cliff federal tax hikes that reduced revenues in several states.

But Kansas tax revenues quickly bounced back to $7.9 billion in 2015 and $8.1 billion in 2016. This tax revenue growth between 2011 and 2016 exceeded average revenue growth in neighboring Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma’s over the same period.

Meanwhile, the tax cuts allowed all employees in Kansas to keep a little more of their earnings, which helped Kansas’ real median household income to increase by 15 percent between 2011 and 2016. This income growth was four times faster than the Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma average, and noticeably outpaced the national rate of 11 percent.

Kansas’ dramatic median income growth over this period bolsters economic and survey evidence that suggest businesses use part of their tax cut savings to worker raises.

This isn’t to say that Kansas’ income tax cut could not have been designed better. Rather than eliminating the small-business tax rate entirely, policymakers should have simply cut it deeply, so it could still capture revenue from ensuing economic growth. Similarly, eliminating deductions, credits, and loopholes – part of Brownback’s original plan – would have broadened the tax base to make the tax code fairer and more efficient.

The proposal Republicans in Congress are working on would do both these things, cutting the small business rate to 25 percent from about 40 percent, and eliminating deductions like the one for state and local taxes that force people in low-tax states to effectively subsidize high-tax states.

Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration can also learn from Kansas by ensuring their plan has guardrails in place to prevent taxpayers from simply shifting their earnings from wage to business income to lessen their tax burden. This is what tens of thousands of Kansas accountants, lawyers, dentists and other professionals did.

The New York Times reports that David Beaty, head coach of the University of Kansas football team, shifted more than two-thirds of his $800,000 annual salary to his business entity to avoid paying about $37,000 in state income taxes. Republicans must learn from this and implement simple rules in their tax plan to prevent such gaming of the system.

But Republicans and tax cut advocates shouldn’t allow “Kansas” to be heard as a disparaging word. Kansas demonstrates that even an imperfect tax cut can still raise incomes and revenues.

Interviewed by phone, Evans’s husband, Jacob, described the longest and most agonizing night of his life. When his wife hadn’t returned home in a reasonable amount of time, he became worried. After calls to friends and the hospital, he drove the route she would’ve taken home and in a matter of minutes was face to face with a police barricade.

The next few hours marched by like exhausted soldiers. Friends and members of his church family filled his home until finally, at 5:30 a.m., the coroner knocked on his door with one hand and held Katie’s driver’s license with the other.

“The first thing I thought was how do I tell my boys,” Evans said. Later that morning, when the moment was right, Evans gathered the three older boys for a family meeting. Evans led a discussion about God’s plan for his children. “Then I told them that God had asked them to exercise faith in (his) plan. I said their mother had been killed. The boys cried their little hearts out and I was so glad to have so many friends there to hug and hold them.”

As Evans considers his wife’s legacy, he knows it’s rooted in forgiveness. He has no doubt Katie would want friends and family to forgive the other driver. Evans says life is too short for anything other than letting go and moving on.

In fact, when he heard that since Katie’s passing some within his company were expressing anger and frustration, Evans wrote an open letter to the employees. It read:

“Obviously this is a difficult time for me and my family. It has been more difficult as I have heard that some are angry with the driver who killed my wife. Katie would not have wanted that. She was the embodiment of compassion. The hateful activities reported in the news recently troubled her greatly. She felt there was already too much anger in the world. I want you to know that I forgive the driver of that accident. Of course I am sorry that it happened. Of course I wish I could go back in time and change it, but we are all best served by moving forward with today’s reality and the best way to move forward is to honor Katie’s memory and focus on how to take care of her six children. Trials and tribulation are mandatory. Misery is optional. Happiness is a choice, sometimes a difficult choice. I confess I feel little in the way of happiness at the moment, but I am determined to be as happy as I can be and for now that is found in my profound gratitude to a generous and supportive community for the love they have wrapped around me and my family during this challenging time.”

As our interview ended, I asked Jacob Evans what final message he had for my readers. “Katie wasn’t perfect. No one is. But if you want to honor Katie, do what she did every day of her life. Go find a way to make the world a little better.”

And what better way to start than exercising a little forgiveness.","Katie Evans, loving mom killed in car crash following visit of premature twins leaves behind beautiful legacy",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/katie-evans-loving-mom-killed-in-car-crash-following-visit-premature-twins-leaves-behind-beautiful-legacy.html

He then apologized to NFL players saying: ""I am truly sorry to the players for how this has impacted them and the perception that it has created of me which could not be further from the truth. Our focus going forward, personally and as an organization, will be towards making meaningful progress regarding the social issues that mean so much to our players and our community.""

“From Pittsburgh to Philadelphia and across central Pennsylvania, families were being torn apart by a heroin epidemic,” he wrote.
I am proud of the work our president and Congress are doing, and will continue to champion, to combat the opioid epidemic.","Last year more than 64,000 Americans in every corner of our country were lost to drug overdoses. That’s 142 people each day.

For too long we have not faced this growing crisis head on. And while we’ve lost so many, we must also remember the innocent children born to addicted parents who are exposed to the dangers of this crisis from their first breath. According to a Center for Disease (CDC) report, the number of babies born addicted to opioids has tripled in the U.S. in 15 years.

It won’t be easy, but we can be – and must be – the generation that puts an end to this crisis, and that starts with our politicians in Washington. Take Pennsylvania, for example, where Sen. Pat Toomey has been on the front lines fighting for increased and more responsible funding of programs to combat this epidemic.

In 2015, Toomey wrote about his experience traveling the state upon being elected and seeing a pattern emerge. “From Pittsburgh to Philadelphia and across central Pennsylvania, families were being torn apart by a heroin epidemic,” he wrote. “More Pennsylvanians will die this year from overdoses and misuse of heroin and opioid painkillers than from influenza or homicide.”

In fact, according to the CDC, three of four new heroin users report abusing opioids before using heroin. In order to stop the cycle of tragedy that Toomey heard about, and that too many people have lived firsthand, we must take action.

The approach President Trump outlined in his speech on Thursday that declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency is holistic and addresses not just the effects of addiction, but also the measures to prevent people from becoming addicted in the first place.

This process starts with educating our kids about the dangers of addiction. The earlier we educate our communities about addiction and the many forms it can take, the more likely we are to prevent people from sliding down that slippery slope.

We must also provide the necessary resources and support to those addicted and those in recovery. Too many relapsed addicts share similar stories of falling back into a cycle of drug abuse by the weight of their past mistakes and inability to re-enter their communities after rehab or incarceration.

Because addiction is a disease, not a moral failing, we must treat it as such.

Until recently, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs almost exclusively treated chronic pain with prescription opioids. Because our nation’s veterans suffer from chronic pain at a rate double the national average, it should be no surprise that this treatment method led to their rates of fatal overdoses also be double the national average.

Our nation’s heroes deserve our very best care, and while the VA has taken steps to curtail the over-prescription of addictive opioids, there is still much work to be done. That’s why Secretary of Veteran’s Affairs David Shulkin visited the Coatesville, Pa., Veterans Affairs Medical Center on Friday to host a roundtable to discuss the successes and continued work being done in the VA to combat the opioid epidemic.

This type of engagement and community discussion is what leads to the policies we’re fighting for in Washington. The conversation must be open and ongoing, but it must also be coupled with action.

Every moment we wait to act, the crisis gets worse.

Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

Five hundred years on, the only viable Protestant future – the only evangelical future, the only future faithful to the Reformers’ vision – is a catholic future.","On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses, a list of propositions aimed at problems in the Roman Catholic Church, to the door of the university church in Wittenberg, Germany. He wanted to start a theological debate. Instead, he started the Reformation.

As Luther’s teaching reverberated through Europe, the aims of his followers expanded. According to historian Scott Hendrix, Protestants aspired to “re-Christianize” Europe.

Europe was already Christian, but in the Reformers’ judgment, its Christianity was skin-deep. Europe needed to recover the gospel, the “good news” about salvation through Jesus. The church, in other words, had to be overhauled by the gospel.

In many ways, the Reformation succeeded.

Catholic teaching had obscured the biblical message that salvation is God’s gift to sinners, not something earned by a pious, moral life. Protestant preachers proclaimed free grace.

Protestantism has a future only if we Protestants recover the original catholic vision of the Reformers. We need to take up the project of uniting and renewing the whole church.

Catholic clergy had treated the laity as second-class citizens. Luther proclaimed the priesthood of believers. All Christians are holy. All are priests, he taught. As a result, Protestant teachers diligently instructed the laity, translated the Bible into various European languages and spread literacy so everyone could read Scripture. Bible knowledge exploded.

Another problem: Catholics rarely took the Lord’s Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist. When they did, they got only bread. To the Reformers, all baptized Christians should receive both bread and wine, God’s gift to the whole church.

The cultural and political effects of the Reformation were huge. Our world was made, for good and ill, by the Reformation.

We don't even know that we live among ruins.

Without Protestant teaching, there’d be no Charles Dickens (“Great Expectations”), John Milton (“Paradise Lost”) or C.S. Lewis (“The Chronicles of Narnia”). The Reformation also contributed to the formation of the nation-state and global politics.

Despite their achievements, the Reformers failed. The gospel took hold in some pockets, but it didn’t reform the whole church or re-Christianize Europe.

The Reformation failed because it fragmented the Western church. Protestants were forced out of the Catholic Church, and soon Protestants began squabbling among themselves.

Before Luther, the Western church wasn’t perfectly calm. But, as Reformation historian Lee Palmer Wandel has shown, the Reformation produced deeper and more lasting divisions.

In 1500, a “Christian” was a baptized Catholic. By 1600, there were competing definitions of “Christian.” Protestants didn’t view Catholics as “Christians,” and vice versa.

By 1600, European Christians didn’t worship together. Catholics didn’t welcome Protestants to the Mass, and Protestants didn’t share the Lord’s Supper with other Protestants.

Divisions split families. Protestants found Catholic weddings repulsive. To Catholics, non-sacramental Protestant marriages were adulterous and Protestant children were – in effect -- bastards.

In some cases, divisions resulted in violence. During the sixteenth century, Christian rulers killed about 5,000 Christians. Survivors fled or were expelled. By 1600, every sort of Christian was persecuted somewhere in Europe.

The Reformers didn’t set out to split the church. The Reformation began as a retrieval, not a rejection, of catholicity and unity. They wanted to reform the whole Western church.

The Reformers denied that the word “catholic,” which means “universal,” was equivalent to “Roman.” The church is catholic because, in all times and places, there is only one church.

Children in Geneva, Switzerland, where Reformation leader John Calvin lived, were taught to believe in one Catholic Church. Calvin’s Catechism said, “As there is but one Head of the faithful so they ought all to be united in one body.”

Catholics charged that Protestants were schismatics, but Calvin turned the accusation around: “Wolves complain against the lambs.” By demanding submission to Rome, Catholics themselves violated catholicity.

For the Reformers, the Catholic Church wasn’t too visible or united. Rome was so swaddled in the trappings of power that the church’s catholic essence, the communion of saints, was barely visible at all.

Why did things go wrong? How did the Catholic Reformation fracture the church?

Martin Bucer, the Reformer of Strasbourg, Germany, said it best: “Both sides have failed. Some of us have overemphasized unimportant points, and others have not adequately reformed obvious abuses.”

A half millennium on, the church remains broken. We don’t kill each other, but we don’t worship together either. There are still competing definitions of “Christian.”

Protestants and Catholics both confess the same core doctrines of the Trinity and the deity of Christ, but at many points our beliefs diverge sharply.

The worst of it is that we’ve become complacent. We act as if a divided church is normal, even healthy. We’re “house blind” and don’t even know that we live among ruins.

Protestantism has a future only if we Protestants recover the original catholic vision of the Reformers. We need to take up the project of uniting and renewing the whole church.

Some Protestants recoil at talk about reuniting Catholics and Protestants in one church (not to mention the Eastern Orthodox Church and others). They see such a project as an abandonment of the Gospel.

And yet it’s exactly the opposite. The imperative to unity is an evangelical imperative, a demand of the Gospel.

Here’s why. The Gospel begins with God’s promise that Abraham’s seed would unite the nations that had been scattered at Babel. All nations would share in God’s blessing (Genesis 12:1-4). Israel’s prophets envisioned a day when nations would stream to Jerusalem to worship the living God. They would learn the Lord’s ways, and turn their firearms into farm tools.

Jesus fulfills the promise to Abraham and the hopes of the prophets. He broke down the dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles. He died and rose again to form a new, united human race.

The Gospel is good news that God has reconciled the sinful human race to himself through Jesus. It’s also the good news that God has reconciled sinful human beings to one another.

The church is called to be God’s new humanity. Drawing from every tribe, tongue and nation, the church is a living sign of the gospel. By definition, a divided church contradicts the gospel. It grieves Jesus, who asked His Father to make us one as the Father is one with the Son (John 17:20-21).

As long as Protestants remain divided from each other, and separated from Catholics, Orthodox and others, our churches fail to experience the fullness of the Gospel.

Yet reunion seems impossible. Will Protestants and Catholics ever agree on the Pope or Mary or the real presence of Christ in the Lord’s Supper or justification by faith?

We can’t reunite the church by ignoring the past or diluting truth. The church will be reunited through a deeper grasp and more faithful practice of the Gospel we preach, truths Christians confess together.

In fact, we can’t reunite the church at all. Only God’s Spirit can overcome the insurmountable obstacles that stand in the way.

The Reformation recovered the Gospel, but undermined that Gospel by the divisions it sowed.

In other words, the Reformation failed. Five hundred years on, the only viable Protestant future – the only evangelical future, the only future faithful to the Reformers’ vision – is a catholic future.","The Reformation, led by Luther, failed.

Somebody violated their oath of secrecy,” Gowdy, a South Carolina lawmaker and former federal prosecutor, also told Fox News on Sunday.
“The Mueller investigation has become an all-out assault to find crimes to pin on them — and it won’t matter if there are no crimes to be found.
Federal agents, reportedly in search of evidence related to the Russia investigation, this summer raided his northern Virginia home.
The FBI also secured approval from a federal court to monitor the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.","Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, the leader of the House’s top investigative committee, slammed special counsel Robert Mueller on Sunday for allowing the news media to learn that he and his legal team now have charges in their Russia investigation.

“In the only conversation I’ve had with Robert Mueller, I stressed to him the importance of cutting out the leaks,” Gowdy, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told “Fox News Sunday.” “It’s kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and the violations of the law would violate the law.”

Mueller and his team have for roughly the past five months been investigating for the Justice Department whether anybody associated with the President Trump’s 2016 White House campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election outcome. On Friday night, CNN reported that Mueller’s team has filed the first charges in the case with a federal grand jury.

“Make no mistake, disclosing grand jury material is a violation of the law. Somebody violated their oath of secrecy,” Gowdy, a South Carolina lawmaker and former federal prosecutor, also told Fox News on Sunday.

The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that anyone charged will be taken into custody Monday. However, the charges have been sealed by a federal judge. So whoever is charged and whether the charges are criminal remains unclear.

The possible charges come as Mueller's tactics have been called into question.

During a raid by the FBI in July of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's Virginia home, a source close to the investigation told Fox News at the time the scope of the search was ""heavy-handed, designed to intimidate.""

Andrew Weissmann, the prosecutor tapped by Mueller to help lead the investigation, has also received criticism. Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor recently wrote about Weissman in a piece titled, “Judging by Mueller's staffing choices, he may not be very interested in justice.”

Powell accused Weissmann, once the director of the Enron Task Force, of “prosecutorial overreach” in past cases and said it could signal what’s to come for President Trump and his associates in the Russia probe.

“What was supposed to have been a search for Russia’s cyberspace intrusions into our electoral politics has morphed into a malevolent mission targeting friends, family and colleagues of the president,” Powell wrote in The Hill. “The Mueller investigation has become an all-out assault to find crimes to pin on them — and it won’t matter if there are no crimes to be found. This team can make some.”

Powell cited several cases where Weissmann won convictions that were later overturned.

During a Saturday appearance on Fox News, former Department of Justice official Robert Driscoll told anchor Leland Vittert it’s possible the indictment might not even be directly tied to Russian collusion.

“Think back to the Clinton years,” Driscoll said. “The Whitewater investigation was about an Arkansas land deal. And it ended up being about something else completely.”

Driscoll added, “Robert Mueller is free to look at taxes, is free to look at lobbying filings, foreign agent filings. Things like that could all be involved that wouldn’t necessarily touch on the issue of Russia collusion that everyone seems focused on politically.”

Speculation has focused on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as likely targets.

Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago -- for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017.

Federal agents, reportedly in search of evidence related to the Russia investigation, this summer raided his northern Virginia home. He also was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.

Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired for failing to fully disclose his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then-Russian ambassador to the United States.

The FBI also secured approval from a federal court to monitor the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

On Saturday, Page released a statement to Fox News in response to questions about whether he or his lawyers have been notified about any charges.

Page said in the statement that he has worked with the executive branch and Congress since being contacted in March. But he also suggested that revelations about the Democratic Party having helped finance a dossier to smear Trump has tainted any Russia probe.

“In terms of ‘charges', I can’t even imagine what might even be considered now that the false evidence from the politically-motivated, big-money-financed Dodgy Dossier that started this extrajudicial disaster has instead been so thoroughly exposed as a complete sham,” Carter wrote in the statement.

Richard Hibey, an attorney for Manafort, told Fox News on Friday that neither he nor any of his colleagues representing Manafort had been informed of any indictment of their client.

Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago – for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017. In addition to his home being raided, Manafort was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.

A retired Army lieutenant general, Flynn served as a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired over his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia's ambassador to the United States.

Mueller has reportedly probed whether Flynn was involved in a private effort to get former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers.

The Justice Department’s special counsel’s office declined to comment on the reports of filed charges.

Trump has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as “a witch hunt”.

The Latest on Somalia's hotel siege (all times local):

4:10 p.m.

Somalia's government has fired the country's police and intelligence chiefs in the wake of Saturday's deadly extremist attack which killed at least 23 people and wounded more than 30 others.

A statement from the Prime Minister's office issued Sunday said police chief Abdullahi Mohamed Ali and Gen. Abdihakim Said were sacked after the cabinet voted to drop both officials.

The firings came after Somali security forces ended a night-long siege at a Mogadishu hotel by five extremist attackers who stormed the building after a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the entrance gate on Saturday afternoon. The attack killed 23 people.

Troops regained control of the Nasa-Hablod hotel on Sunday morning, having killed three attackers and captured two alive, said Capt. Mohamed Hussein.

Al-Shabab, Africa's deadliest Islamic extremist group, quickly claimed responsibility for the attack.

Saturday's attack came two weeks after more than 350 people were killed in a massive truck bombing on a busy Mogadishu street in Somalia's worst-ever attack.

There's been no crime, but the guard is suspicious and passes the man's license plate number to the FBI.

In a case like this, the FBI might query databases containing foreign intelligence collected overseas. An agent might learn nothing or might find out the plate belongs to an American communicating online with a suspected Islamic State militant.

It's these scraps of data, sometimes meaningless on their own, that can help foil plots and save lives, the government contends. But as Congress considers how to reauthorize the law governing the government's use of such information, lawmakers from both parties and many people in the United States want stricter controls to better protect privacy.

FBI Director Christopher Wray crafted the bridge story to show why his agents shouldn't have to get a warrant before querying foreign intelligence information legally gathered overseas. The FBI's use of foreign intelligence is at the heart of the debate over the future of the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act, including the controversial Section 702. The law is set to expire Dec. 31.

""Let's say you find out that this person photographing the Key Bridge has been communicating with a known Islamic State recruiter, which is the kind of information that's in the 702 database,"" Wray said at a recent forum on the subject. The FBI agent, Wray said, is ""not going to be able to get a warrant just based on that to search the database.""

""The idea of blinding the agent — putting some restriction on his ability to see information that we already constitutionally have sitting in our own data bases — the irony of that is tragic to me,"" Wray said.

But the government already has many tools it can use to collect information about someone without a warrant, said Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a staunch advocate of privacy rights. He said it can obtain phone records — who someone called and when — without a warrant.

""That will show if this bridge suspect is talking to terrorists,"" Wyden said. ""Going straight to reading the content of private communications without a warrant is an end-run around the Fourth Amendment,"" which protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures.

""Think about it,"" he said. ""Would you want the government reading your emails or listening to your phone calls, just because someone called the FBI and said you looked suspicious?""

There is bipartisan agreement that the law is invaluable in helping the U.S. track foreign spies, terrorists, weapons trafficking and cyber criminals. But some members of Congress and privacy advocates want greater protections for the communications of Americans that also are picked up. They think the FBI should be required to obtain a warrant if it wants to search foreign intelligence in investigating tips such as the fictitious American at the bridge.

Measures circulating in Congress seek to address several open questions:

—Should the law be extended permanently or only for a certain number of years?

—Should the FBI have to get a warrant to query the foreign intelligence database, or only if wants to peruse the information?

—Can law enforcement officials read foreign intelligence to search for evidence against Americans in routine criminal investigations without a court order based on probable cause?

—Should the government have to give the public more details about how extensively it uses the foreign intelligence database, or how many U.S. citizens' communications are incidentally collected?

Wray said tips are flooding into the FBI by the thousands. It's at this initial stage — where leads are sifted and prioritized — when foreign intelligence helps connect dots and spot possible national security threats, he said.

Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats calls this trove of foreign intelligence the ""holy grail"" that provides insight into the thinking and actions of U.S. adversaries. ""We have not found one intentional breach, one intentional misuse of this authority,"" Coats said.

Adm. Mike Rogers, the National Security Agency director, said the authority has provided actionable information about enemy movements in Afghanistan, helped take key IS militants off the battlefield, revealed details about illegal weapons transfers, assisted allies and generated information that U.S. intelligence agencies' used to assess Russia interference in the presidential election.

Intelligence and law enforcement officials say Section 702 is not about bulk collection of information — not even foreigners — and is never used to target Americans.

Still, former acting CIA Director Mike Morell said one part of the law that needs to be changed is the FBI's ability to search the data for information on Americans without first obtaining a warrant. He makes exceptions for emergencies or an imminent terrorist threat.

The law shouldn't ""offer an easy route for federal law enforcement agents, specifically the FBI, to obtain evidence about Americans to which they would not be otherwise entitled,"" Morell said.

Privacy advocates agree, but are unsure how Congress will act, given the variety of legislative proposals.

""There's everything between no fix whatsoever and a complete prohibition on a query without a warrant,"" said Elizabeth Goitein at New York University School of Law. ""I think there has to be a warrant requirement in order to search for Americans' communications in the Section 702 data.""",FBI's use of foreign intelligence driving privacy debate,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/29/fbis-use-foreign-intelligence-driving-privacy-debate.html

Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces.
In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.
The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.
Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.","Officially retired, Army Capt. Gary “Mike” Rose was never in Laos at the height of the Vietnam War.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

And it’s for a good cause. Since October, $1 from each calendar goes to Give A Hoot, a campaign supporting breast cancer research.

Fox News spoke with the Texas native living in Hollywood about appearing in the latest Hooters calendar, how she was hired by the restaurant and the one talent she loves to show off:

Fox News: Can you describe that moment when you saw yourself on the cover for the first time?

Chelsea Morgensen: My managers first told me I was going to be doing a TV appearance, but instead they were actually surprising me with my cover. The entire restaurant was chanting my name as I came downstairs. I had no idea what was going on. And then they finally showed me the cover… I loved it. I just really loved my picture! I was so excited, the whole restaurant was cheering for me… But it didn’t actually hit me until… I saw the physical, actual calendar. I just thought, ‘Wow, this actually happened.’

A post shared by Chelsea Morgensen (@chelseamorgensen) on Oct 10, 2017 at 8:46am PDT

Fox News: When did you first became involved with Hooters?

Morgensen: I started working for Hooters in April 2015. I was actually just eating at Hooters because I love their wings and thought, ‘You know, I really need a job. I wonder if they’re hiring.’ I asked the Hooters girl there and she said, ‘Yeah! Stop in tomorrow and meet our manager.’ I went in… They pretty much hired me on the spot. It was pretty exciting. I was a bit overwhelmed, but I am glad that I pursued it. It’s been the best job I’ve ever had.

Fox News: How has working at Hooters helped you build self-confidence?

Morgensen: Just having to interact with people every day, especially working in Hollywood, people come from all over the country… I had to open up and talk to everybody. Being outgoing just in the workplace encouraged me to get out more in my regular life.

Fox News: What’s your relationship like with your customers?

Morgensen: In Hollywood, we actually have very few regulars… It’s always new customers. But recently — and I’m so excited about this — I actually created two regulars of my own that now frequent the restaurant, which is really cool!

A post shared by Chelsea Morgensen (@chelseamorgensen) on Aug 24, 2017 at 9:55pm PDT

My relationships with them are very friendly. We talk about work, travel, careers. I’m modeling and acting now, so they’re always really curious about what that’s like and see how I’m doing… If they’re ever having a down day, I try to turn it around for them. I really like having that familiar face come in. And I hope to create more of them.

Fox News: Have you interacted with any celebrities?

Morgensen: I personally have not that I know of, but there are some celebrities that come in. I know we had a football player one time who came in and ordered one of everything on the entire menu… We do have some celebrities who come in every now and then.

Fox News: Some people believe Hooters depicts women in a negative light. How do you respond to the criticism?

Morgensen: Honestly, I haven’t experienced any incidents of negativity. It has done nothing but empowered me. It has given me so much more confidence. And all the girls that work there are amazing. There are girls going to school to become nurses, become lawyers, to be doctors… I think it’s a great job… It gives you that ability to talk to anybody… I have had nothing, but positive experiences working with Hooters.

A post shared by Chelsea Morgensen (@chelseamorgensen) on Aug 7, 2017 at 1:50pm PDT

Fox News: Are there any misconceptions you feel people have that just aren’t true?

Morgensen: I think a lot of people need to visit Hooters and see it for themselves. Hooters is a great family-oriented restaurant. Families bring their kids all the time and they absolutely love it. They have a blast. So if someone has any misconceptions, they just need to come to Hooters and experience it for themselves.

Fox News: Before Hooters, you were a pageant girl in 2009. What was that like?

Morgensen: I was a tomboy my whole life… But I was tall and thin, so people would always tell me that I should model. A friend of my mom's told me there was a beauty pageant coming up and I should compete in it. It was part of the Miss Universe organization… It was in my hometown of Texas, so I competed there and ended up winning… I was so surprised, I didn’t know what I had gotten myself into… It actually led me to Hollywood and that’s where I wanted to end up.

Fox News: What’s the most outrageous thing you’ve ever had to do for a good photo?

Morgensen: I was in New York and shooting a summer line for a purse collection. It was about five degrees outside. It was also raining. I was wearing a tank top with strappy heels and little capri pants. I was just wearing that while walking around the street as photos were being taken of the purses. It was so, so cold. I couldn’t feel my body or anything. But that’s how it is in this industry. It’s all over the place, but I love it.

The deaths – a rate of 100 per month – were among more than 3,200 suspected opioid overdoses reported in the state over the same time four-month time period, the Arizona Republic reported Friday.

The shocking numbers were the latest statistical evidence drawing attention to a drug crisis that has plagued the nation – and prompted President Donald Trump on Thursday to declare a “public health emergency.”

The latest data from Arizona were posted Oct. 17 by Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services (AZDHS).

The Arizona Republic’s report came one day after Arizona billionaire John Kapoor, 74, was arrested in connection with an opioid-related bribery scheme. Kapoor’s predecessor as CEO of Insys Therepeutics of Chandler, Ariz. – and five other former executives and managers of the company – have been indicted on similar charges.

Illustrating the extent of the opioid problem, a Rhode Island doctor pleaded guilty Wednesday to participating in the Insys scheme, Reuters reported, and a Kansas physician – whose office was raided by the FBI in July -- faces two lawsuits from patients who claim he pushed an Insys product on them as part of the scheme, the Kansas City Star reported.

In her post, Christ writes that only a quarter of the medical professionals prescribing opioids in Arizona had been checking the AZDHS database on overdoses before writing a prescription. But as of Oct. 16, state law now requires clinicians to check the database before prescribing opioids or benzodiazepines, the Republic reported.

Christ noted that other states have implemented similar mandates, resulting in fewer opioid prescriptions, the newspaper reported.

According to Christ, the data gathered by AZDHS has revealed he following insights into Arizona’s opioid problem:

- Men in their mid- to late 20s are at the highest risk of opioid overdoses.

- Most overdoses occur at home.

- Nearly 40 percent of people suspected of experiencing an overdose were prescribed an opioid less than eight weeks earlier.

- Chronic pain is the symptom cited most frequently by those who experience a suspected overdose.

""ADHS will continue to monitor these indicators on a monthly basis to assess progress,"" Christ said.","Arizona seeing 100 opioid deaths per month, data show",https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/28/arizona-seeing-100-opioid-deaths-per-month-data-show.html

RTR will reveal exactly how powerful it is and how much it costs when the car makes its public debut at the SEMA show in Las Vegas next week, along with information about the Level 1 and 2 versions, which are less powerful but also get handling upgrades.

Prices for the 2017 Level 1, 2, and 3 packages were $7,950, $11,995 and $20,995 in addition to the stock donor car, with the top model rated at a now-measly 670 hp. RTR builds about 100 cars annually that are sold through a network of certified Ford dealers with a warranty.

The show's format pivoted to focus on victims of the shooting, as well as those recovering from hurricanes and wildfires, with a night of somber tributes, inspirational anthems and voices lifted in harmony.

Aldean, who was on stage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the shooting occurred Oct. 1, stood side-by-side with the night's other award winners, including Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban, to dedicate the night to music fans. The honorees did not accept awards or give speeches as usual, but some chose to perform or other musicians performed in their honor.

""We've been tested beyond our worst nightmare these past few months,"" Aldean said during the live broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee. ""Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe how some of us feel. But we have proven time and again in this country that we have the power to overcome anything that threatens our way of life, or our freedom. We dedicate this night to you and everyone who has experienced loss or tragedy in the last few months.""

Aldean closed out the night with a defiant and rollicking group performance of ""I Won't Back Down"" by Tom Petty with Urban, Stapleton and Little Big Town.

Andra Day kicked off the awards show with her anthem ""Rise Up,"" in a beautiful harmony duet by Little Big Town. Then Lee Ann Womack, Danielle Bradbury and rapper Common joined them for a performance of ""Stand Up For Something.""

""On this night when we usually celebrate a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human spirit, the spirit we see in our fans every night,"" Stapleton said.

""So in some small way we want to thank you for your resolve and perhaps lift your spirits for just a moment,"" Urban said.

The names of the 58 victims from Las Vegas were listed during an in memoriam segment, along with the names of Petty, Gregg Allman, Glen Campbell, Don Williams and Troy Gentry.

Other performances including Bryan singing his single ""Fast,"" and Stapleton singing his song ""Broken Halos,"" a song that he's dedicated to victims of the Vegas shooting.

The Backstreet Boys sang Florida Georgia Line's emotional ballad ""H.O.L.Y."" and Keith Urban performed a jazzy version of his song ""Blue Ain't Your Color.""

Phillip Phillips added some blues licks to Sam Hunt's mega hit ""Body Like a Back Road,"" which was named song of the year by CMT.

Near the end of the night, Bryan took a moment to honor his friend Aldean.

""It could have been any one of us standing on that stage two weeks ago,"" Bryan said. ""It's a nightmare that nobody should have to face. Jason has responded with dignity, care, respect and, some ways, defiance. And we all proud of him, especially me.""

The current ACU weighs about 1.4 pounds and has lots of pockets and multiple layers of fabric. This means that “when it gets wet, it tends to stay wet,” the Army explained in a statement released this week. “And when it's hot out, it tends to keep soldiers hot,” it added.

The answer is the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform, which has fewer pockets, layers of fabric and Velcro, the Army said. The new uniform also uses a lighter fabric.

THE EVOLUTION OF US MILITARY CAMOUFLAGE: FROM BASIC GREEN AND KHAKI TO DIGITAL PATTERNS AND BEYOND

""You can hold that uniform up with one finger,"" said Brig. Gen. Brian P. Cummings, Program Executive Officer (PEO) Soldier, out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in the statement.

While the current ACU has had a lot of positive feedback, Cummings noted that the likes of shoulder pockets, pen pockets, leg pockets and Velcro swatches for patches require multiple layers of fabric, fastening material and buttons. All of these features hold water “and cost money,” he added.

The jacket from the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform is on display at PEO Soldier.

HISTORY OF CAMOUFLAGE IN PICTURES

U.S. soldiers in jungle environments will be the first to get their hands on the lightweight uniform, specifically the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. Cummings said that the Army eventually wants to make the uniform available to all soldiers.

The Army hopes that the new uniform will be available within a year. Cummings explained, however, that the new uniform’s fabric may prove more susceptible to wrinkling after washing. This could be fixed with the application of an anti-wrinkling treatment, although that would depend on whether the treatment interfered with the uniform’s ability to wick away water.

The new uniform’s flame-resistant capability also needs to be considered, according to Cummings.

In addition to the new uniform, the Army is also working on a new jungle boot. Last month, soldiers in the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii received 30,000 pairs of the new design to evaluate.

EVOLUTION OF COMBAT BOOTS: FROM BOOTEES TO MODERN TACTICAL BOOTS

Feedback on the boots has been positive, but Cummings said that soldiers want a boot that is lighter and softer. They have also requested thinner soles.

The next set of samples, Cummings said, will be ""a lot more pliable. And able to serve the soldier well. But instead of lasting five years, they [will] last two years.""

The newer boots will also go through evaluation with soldiers and share features with the boots currently being tested. These capabilities include puncture resistance, more drainage holes, the ability to wick away water, the ability to push water and mud off the soles, speed laces and lower profile heels so as not to catch on vines on the jungle floor, according to the Army’s statement.

In 2016, it happened again.”President Trump has begun to reverse President Obama's policies, and the United States now treats Cuba as the dictatorship it is.
They fear that if President Trump were to demand the rule of law be applied across Guatemala, Morales would agree.
The opportunity and the need to close the Guatemalan backdoor to the United States has never been greater.","President Obama’s foreign policy of appeasement won him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for merely being elected. In the Middle East, it led to a frightful deal with Iran. In the Western Hemisphere it led to the embrace of anti-American dictators, such as the Castro regime in Cuba, cheered on by the United Nations.

Now President Trump is suffering the unfortunate harvest of what President Obama sowed.

Just as the Obama administration changed America’s longstanding Cuba policy, it embraced Castro-supported allies throughout Latin America, including in Guatemala. This has created chaos on Mexico’s southern border and allowed the likes of the violent MS-13 criminal gang to run riot, and opened the way for more illegal drugs to flow into the United States.

U.S. control of the skies and seas makes land the safest alternative to smuggle people and contraband from Central and South America into our country. Guatemala’s porous 595-mile border – the only southern land route to Mexico – has become an unlocked backdoor and a gateway to the U.S., thanks to organized crime and Mexican corruption.

President Obama’s embrace of Marxists in Guatemala has kept that backdoor wide open, and traffic is flowing, including the opioids that President Trump just declared are a public health emergency.

Navy Adm. Kurt Tidd of the U.S. Southern Command said in 2016 that transnational drug smuggling networks can also move people with known terrorist ties from the Middle East up through Central America and into the United States. A Southern Command spokesperson estimated in 2015 more than 30,000 people took that path from countries of terrorist concern.

Guatemala was the staging area for the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that tried but failed to overthrow Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. After that, Castro supported, trained, and armed guerrillas in Guatemala, subjecting the country to a conflict that ended with the 1996 peace accords. The guerrillas then morphed into nongovernmental organizations and political parties.

The guerrilla successors won the lottery with the 2008 election of President Obama, whose State Department helped place their allies in powerful government positions, especially in the judiciary. Their magistrates collaborate with the United Nations-created International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which was praised by liberal billionaire George Soros as a “potent potential model” for other countries.

The CICIG and the judiciary protect the Marxists from prosecution while targeting the opposition, including legitimate authorities, with false witnesses and phony charges.

I shudder to think how much of the $18 billion Soros has committed to his open-borders agenda is destined for Guatemala.

Guatemala’s rural areas, especially the border with Mexico, have little government presence. Protected by the Guatemalan judiciary – with the help of the U.S. State Department, the U.N. and Soros – the guerilla successors have made the region chaotically violent, forcing many residents to flee for their lives.

The U.N. high commissioner for refugees says that since 2008 there has been a nearly five-fold increase in Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras) asylum-seekers coming to the United States, “a staggering indicator of the surging violence shaking the region.”

In fact, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection: “In 2014, Central Americans apprehended on the southern border outnumbered Mexicans for the first time. In 2016, it happened again.”

President Trump has begun to reverse President Obama's policies, and the United States now treats Cuba as the dictatorship it is. The Trump administration has sanctioned Venezuelan human-rights violators, overruling Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon, an Obama holdover.

Aware of the turnaround, leftists in Guatemala are trying to consolidate their gains made under President Obama by, among other actions, attempting to remove Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales from office. They fear that if President Trump were to demand the rule of law be applied across Guatemala, Morales would agree. The Guatemalan president is a political novice but not a leftist.

The UNE Party is the agent of the push to remove Morales and illegally change Guatemala’s constitution. UNE members voted unanimously in Guatemala’s Congress against a resolution to condemn Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro for illegally changing Venezuela’s constitution, which was the impetus for President Trump's strong sanctions on that nation.

The Trump administration must look hard at Guatemala. Otherwise, those promoting the open-borders agenda – Obama holdovers like Shannon, their U.N. allies and Soros – will complete their subversion of the country that is vital to U.S. national security and public health.

The opportunity and the need to close the Guatemalan backdoor to the United States has never been greater. It cannot wait for our enemies to consolidate their gains.

Country star Alan Jackson, the late guitarist and singer Jerry Reed and songwriter Don Schlitz were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday.

Country icon Loretta Lynn returned to the Hall of Fame for the first time since she suffered a stroke in May to formally induct Jackson. Lynn, who cancelled her tour dates this year to recover, said Jackson was the only person that could make her leave her house.

She recalled meeting Jackson when he was a nervous young artist decades ago and knowing then that he would ""be one of the greatest singers in country music.""

""He hadn't let me down,"" said Lynn, who is also a member of the Hall of Fame.

The 59-year-old Jackson is still one of country music's most successful solo artists, having sold nearly 45 million albums in the United States and had 26 singles reach the top of the Billboard country charts.

With his baritone voice and knack for telling stories about small town Southern life, the Newnan, Georgia-born singer was among a wave of neo-traditionalists that broke through in the 1990s.

He joked that when he was signed to Arista Nashville, a label started by Clive Davis, they had no idea how popular he would become.

""I was just a token country singer they signed for that label and bam, I took off,"" Jackson said.

Many of his hits became instant classics, from the barroom staple ""Chattahoochee"" to the somber ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"" written after the Sept. 11 attacks.

But he's also been characterized as shy and uneasy in the media spotlight.

""I am not really shy, just socially awkward,"" Jackson said. ""I just don't like to talk too much.""

Instead, he let his songs speak for him, often writing about his father, his wife and the everyday joys and sorrows of the average man. Other hits include ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"" ''A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)"" and ""When Somebody Loves You.""

George Strait, Alison Krauss and Lee Ann Womack each performed one of Jackson's songs in his honor.

Reed, who died at age 71 in 2008, was first known as an in-demand studio musician with a unique finger picking style on the guitar. He played for and wrote songs for stars like Elvis Presley and Porter Wagoner.

Reed, originally from Atlanta, became more popular when his songs began charting. His hit song ""When You're Hot, You're Hot"" earned him a Grammy award.

In later years, he started appearing in TV and movies, most notably playing Burt Reynolds' sidekick in ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He also sang many of the songs on the soundtrack, including ""East Bound and Down.""

His daughters, Seidina Hubbard and Lottie Zavala, accepted the honor on his behalf.

Hubbard said one of her fondest memories of growing up was listening ""to the beautiful sound of that guitar in the house all the time.""

Performing some of his songs were guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, John Knowles and Steve Wariner, while Jamey Johnson performed one of his personal favorites, ""East Bound and Down.""

Schlitz, 65, from Durham, North Carolina, had his first songwriting hit in 1978 when Kenny Rogers recorded his song, ""The Gambler,"" which became Rogers' signature song throughout his career.

Other songs he helped write include ""On the Other Hand"" and ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" both sung by Randy Travis; ""When You Say Nothing at All,"" recorded by both Keith Whitley and Alison Krauss; and ""Strong Enough to Bend,"" by Tanya Tucker.

He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 and helped to create the popular songwriters in the round format at Nashville's famed Bluebird Café.

Aloe Blacc and Vince Gill sang a duet version of ""The Gambler,"" while singers Charlie Worsham and Mary Chapin Carpenter also performed his songs in his honor.

Schlitz gave some advice to his grandchildren seated in the audience from what he had learned in his career.

""No one does this alone. In your life, be a part of something bigger than yourself,"" Schlitz said.",Loretta Lynn returns after stroke to honor Alan Jackson,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/loretta-lynn-returns-after-stroke-to-honor-alan-jackson.html

English majors no longer required to take class focused on Chaucer, Shakespeare

A year and a half after a petition circulated calling for Yale to “decolonize the English department,” the first students are enrolled in a new course created by the department to increase the breadth of the curriculum and combat claims of departmental racism.

What’s more, new requirements are in place to ensure a more “diversified” slate of courses.

The Washington Post reported Saturday that a panel called the Players Coalition has requested a meeting Monday in Philadelphia with league Commissioner Roger Goodell, Houston Texans owner Bob McNair, and free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

It wasn’t immediately clear if all parties had agreed to attend.

Meanwhile, ESPN reported Saturday that the Houston Texans players were planning to stage an unspecified protest against McNair's remarks prior to Sunday's game against the Seahawks in Seattle.

“Many players have been deeply troubled by the disturbing comments made by Texans' owner Bob McNair,” the Players Coalition said in a statement. “It is ironic that such a quote would emerge in the midst of an ongoing struggle to highlight injustices suffered by people of color, including our nation's deeply flawed approach to criminal justice and inhumane treatment of imprisoned people.”

McNair has apologized twice since making what he described as a “very regretful comment” during a recent league meeting about players’ national anthem protests. The comment was published in ESPN The Magazine.

But McNair insisted afterward that he wasn’t referring to the players as “inmates” when he said, “We can’t have the inmates running the prison.” Instead, he said, he was describing the relationship between team owners and the league office in New York.

Nevertheless, in a league on edge over race-related matters -- sparked in large part by Kaepernick’s 2016 protests against American society’s treatment of people of color – the “inmates” remark wasn’t accepted well.

Last season Kaepernick, who was with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling during the national anthem before games, saying he was protesting police killings of African-Americans. But many critics argued that protesting during the anthem was disrespectful to the nation and especially the members of the U.S. military.

After President Donald Trump made a veiled reference to Kaepernick as a “son of a bitch” during a September speech in Alabama, more players joined the protest – even though Kaepernick was out of the league by then.

In their statement, the players asserted that McNair’s remark suggested that some league officials were not taking their concerns seriously.

“As long as the prevailing reality of our league includes a culture where owners feel such behavior and language is permissible, our cause will continue to be stifled and progress will remain elusive,” the statement said. “This isn't about being a player or a club owner - but basic human decency.”

According to ESPN, the Players Coalition is led by Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, retired wide receiver Anquan Boldin and other players who are engaged in community activism.","NFL players seek meeting with Goodell, McNair, Kaepernick",http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/29/nfl-players-seek-meeting-with-goodell-mcnair-kaepernick.html

Appearing on CBS’ “Face the Nation” to publicize his memoir entitled, “An American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice,” Khan said Kelly “indulged in defending behavior of the president and made the situation even worse.”

He criticized Kelly for standing by President Donald Trump, who engaged in a very public feud on TV and Twitter last week over Gold Star families.

Khan, the father of U.S. soldier Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq, added that “restraint and dignity” should be “the call of the moment” when dealing with Gold Star families, instead of turning them into a “political football.”

His comments came more than a year after the Democrats gave him a major platform: the party's 2016 convention. Khan said on stage that Trump had “sacrificed nothing and no one” for America — unlike Humayun, who posthumously received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart after a suicide bomber killed him in 2004.

Trump later challenged Khizr Khan’s claims. “I’ve made a lot of sacrifices,” Trump said. “I work very, very hard. I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures.”

Trump has been engaged in an ongoing feud with Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., who said she listened in to a condolence call he made last week to an Army widow. Wilson said Trump told the widow that her deceased husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, “knew what he signed up for.” Trump denied it.

Kelly on Thursday publicly criticized Wilson’s involvement in the call and also suggested she was trying to politicize the matter.

Wilson also suggested that Kelly, whose son was killed in Afghanistan, was forced to make public statements on the call to save his job, amid speculation that Trump is unhappy with his performance.

Khan, a Charlottesville resident, also expressed shock on “Face the Nation” about seeing Kelly “standing next to the President when the President could not have the proper words to condemn the attack on the blessed city of Charlottesville, Virginia by Neo-Nazis.”

Trump was criticized for saying “both sides” were to blame after white nationalists and alt-right groups gathered in the southern town to protest the removal of a Confederate statue on August 12, sparking violence. Police said a Nazi sympathizer plowed his car through a group of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer, a paralegal.

The small sword was owned by Col. Jonathan Pettibone of the 18th (Connecticut) Regiment, who fought in the battles for New York in 1776. Pettibone, of Simsbury, Connecticut, died in Rye, New York, in September of that year, shortly after the Battle of Long Island.

The weapon, which is inscribed with Pettibone’s name, will go on display at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia beginning in 2018.

Experts note that it is unusual for Revolutionary War swords to have the name of the original owner inscribed on the weapon. The sword also bears the mark of its maker, silversmith Joseph Copp of New London, Connecticut.

“With the rare maker's hallmark, and considering who owned it and the history it probably saw, this sword is truly one of the most fascinating Revolutionary War weapons I have ever seen,” said Dr. Philip Mead, chief historian and director of curatorial affairs at the Museum, in a statement.

The Museum received the sword Wednesday from donor B. Owen Williams of Maryland, a descendent of Pettibone.

“As a family, we are delighted that the Museum will provide a home for this article, where it should be, in an exhibit to be seen by the many visitors who come to the Museum from all over,” said Williams, in the statement. “I’m thrilled that it has survived in remarkably good condition despite my youthful exuberance and blissful ignorance to play with it surreptitiously as a boy.”

After Pettibone’s death the sword was passed on to his son Jonathan Pettibone Jr., who also served in the Revolutionary War.

Authorities were alerted in February after someone reported receiving an image depicting a female toddler engaged in a sex act which Justin Crandall had sent, according to court documents.

The child's mother told investigators at the time she noticed some changes in her child's behavior, along with unexplained injuries.

The abuse of the 17-month old victim was connected to Crandall's meth addiction, The Press & Sun-Bulletin reported.

Jessica Crandall, 27. admitted she and her husband engaged in ""repeated sexual activities"" involving the child. according to court documents.

At a detention hearing in April, U.S. Magistrate Judge David Peebles described the crimes as ""barbaric acts,"" the newspaper reported.

Both Crandalls face a minimum penalty of 15 years in prison, and will be sentenced Feb. 23 in federal court in Binghamton.

Organizers say the march's goal is to defend Spain's unity and reject ""an unprecedented attack in the history of democracy."" Leaders of rival pro-union parties from the ruling conservatives, the pro-business liberals and the socialists have joined together under the slogan ""We are all Catalonia. Common sense for coexistence!""

Rally organizers Societat Civil Catalana, the leading pro-union grassroots group, said that over 1 million people turned out for the march that maintained a festive mood without any incidents reported. Police haven't yet provided a crowd estimate.

Many demonstrators waving Spanish, Catalan and European Union flags flooded a central boulevard. Some held hand-made signs and banners reading ""We won't let Spain to be torn apart into pieces"" and ""The awakening of a silenced nation.""

CATALONIA PUSHES FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM SPAIN: WHAT TO KNOW

""Catalan leaders have broken the law. The central government has let this situation go for too long, for even 30 or 40 years, thinking that we were never going to arrive to this extreme, but here we are,"" said Angelita Cuesta, a 66-year-old retiree. ""Our society is fractured, there are family members and friends who no longer can talk about politics to avoid conflict.""

Three weeks ago, the same group organized a mass rally that brought hundreds of thousands onto Barcelona's streets. That was by far the largest pro-union show of force in Catalonia in recent years, in contrast to huge rallies by separatists.

""We have organized ourselves late, but we are here to show that there is a majority of Catalans that are no longer silent and that no longer want to be silenced,"" Societat Civil Catalana president Alex Ramos said.

Members of Spain's central government, including Health Minister Dolors Montserrat, and Enric Millo, who is Madrid's representative in Catalonia, also attended Sunday's rally. No major pro-independence marches were expected.

Catalonia's separatist leader, who was fired along with his regional government on Saturday, has called for Catalans to engage in peaceful opposition to Spain's crackdown to keep the country together.

The vote by pro-independence lawmakers Friday in favor of secession, and Madrid's response triggering unprecedented constitutional powers taking control of Catalan affairs, was the climax of Spain's worst political crisis in decades.

DEFAINT CATALAN LEADER CALLS FOR PEACEFUL PROTESTS

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy also dissolved Catalonia's parliament and called a new regional election for Dec. 21.

Separatists only won 48 percent of the vote in Catalonia in the last regional election in 2015, although they took more seats because of Spanish election law which gives more weight to sparsely populated areas.

The top politicians for pro-union parties wanted to use Sunday's rally as a launchpad for the critical elections in just over six weeks.

""It's time to take over the streets and take over the ballot boxes,"" said Albert Rivera, the leader of the center-right Citizens party.

Oriol Junqueras, the ousted vice president of Catalonia's rebellious government, wrote in an open letter in Catalan newspaper El Punt-Avui on Sunday that separatists should consider participating in the elections. That was in response to some secessionists who argue to boycott them.

The Catalan parliament's vote to secede came after an illegal Oct. 1 referendum in Catalonia in favor of independence. Spain's constitutional court had outlawed the vote, and local opponents to secession had boycotted the process after separatists violated parliament rules to push through its convocation.

Voting on the day itself was marred by violence when national police clashed with people attempting to cast their ballots, in what was widely seen in the region as a heavy-handed response by Spanish police. But Spain's government said that the police response was proportionate to the resistance that officers met.

SPAIN TAKES OVER CATALONIA, FIRES DEFIANT SEPARATIST LEADERS

Ousted Catalan president Carles Puigdemont issued a televised message Saturday saying that he and other regional officials fired by Madrid would keep ""working to build a free country."" His comments were a veiled refusal to accept his Cabinet's dismissal as ordered by central authorities.

Following their official dismissal, Puigdemont and the 12 members who until Saturday made up the Catalan Cabinet are no longer paid.

Spain's government has said they could be charged with usurping others' functions if they refuse to obey, which could throw the region into further turmoil by prolonging a monthlong standoff.

Separately, a Belgian government official said Sunday it would be ""not unrealistic"" for Puigdemont to ask for asylum, and warned it would create serious diplomatic difficulties with fellow European Union member state Spain.

Asylum State Secretary Theo Francken said on Twitter that ""it is possible to ask for asylum as an EU subject"" in Belgium, adding it was up to independent asylum authorities whether to grant it.

The 28-nation EU is considered a bloc where the rule of law applies and granting asylum based on arguments that repression would endanger the full exercise of one's rights would be exceptional.

""If you assess the situation at this stage, including the prison terms and the repression from Madrid,"" Francken told VTM network, ""there is the question whether a person like that can get a fair trial, of course.""

In another tweet, he stressed Belgium wasn't seeking such a scenario. ""I am not rolling out the welcome mat,"" he said.

In the past, some Basque separatists have asked for asylum in Belgium and weren't extradited to Spain, causing years of friction.

7 - The sound we hear from Christine’s engine isn’t a Plymouth Fury.
It was Preston’s third movie role; she was 20 during filming.","Stephen King taught us some important lessons while ascending to his rightful place as America’s most prolific author of horror and supernatural fiction. For instance: don’t dump pig’s blood on Carrie, never stay at The Shining’s Overlook Hotel (Here’s Johnny!”), and for goodness’ sake, tread lightly when dealing with a 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine.

King’s characters didn’t have the benefit of hindsight, however, and their misfortunes still haunt many of us to this day. And for classic car lovers, no King story resonates quite like the “fear on four wheels” that we experienced on the pages of Christine—or better yet, in the 1983 film of the same name (let’s not talk about the 2016 remake). Even the original movie trailer raises the hair on the backs of our necks.

King takes the classic tale of boy-meets-girl to frightening heights when a geeky teenager named Arnie falls for a red Plymouth Fury with a sketchy past. Christine falls hard for Arnie, too, which would be roses and balloon drops if it weren’t for one tiny detail: the car is a killing machine with a long memory and a short fuse. Moral of the story: Never underestimate the fury of a Fury, particularly one that just…won’t…die.

As we hand out Halloween candy to all the little ghosts and goblins out there, here’s a little something for big kids: 10 things you may not know about the original Christine movie:

1 - More than 20 cars were required to play the role of Christine (anywhere from 23–28, depending on the source), and not all of them were Furys. Columbia Pictures placed ads across the country and gobbled up not only Furys, but Belvederes and Savoys, as well. The majority were used on screen, and the rest served as parts cars.

2 - When filming wrapped, only a few unscathed cars remained, and they went on the road to promote the film before being sold to collectors. A fourth car also escaped the crusher and ended up in private hands. One of the movie cars sold for $198,000 at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale auction in January 2015. By comparison, our Hagerty Valuation Tool lists the average value of a 1958 Plymouth Fury in #2 (excellent) condition at $47,700.

3 - King said he chose a 1958 Plymouth Fury as the story’s central figure because it was a “forgotten car.” The fact that the model name seems to fit its angry disposition is purely coincidental. “I didn’t want a car that already had a legend attached to it, like the ’50s Thunderbird,” King said.

4 - The movie’s opening scene, showing Christine moving along a Detroit assembly line, wasn’t in King’s book; screenwriter Bill Phillips added it. The movie, by the way, went into production before the novel was released.

5 - Whenever Christine goes into a rage, the car’s windows are blacked out to accentuate its evilness, but the darkened glass also served a higher purpose—you couldn’t see the stunt driver. The problem was, those scenes were filmed primarily at night, which made it even more difficult for the driver to see.

6 - The illusion of Christine regenerating herself was created using hydraulic pumps inside the car that were attached to the sides of a plastic-paneled body double. The pumps sucked in the sides to create the damaged version of the car, and then the film was reversed, making it appear like the car was fixing itself.

7 - The sound we hear from Christine’s engine isn’t a Plymouth Fury. Filmmakers recorded the engine of a 1970 Mustang 428 Super Cobra Jet and used that instead.

8 - Speaking of memorable sounds, the F-word was used a lot in the dialogue, reportedly because executives thought no one would pay to see a horror film if it was rated PG, and there wasn’t enough violence to warrant an R rating.

9 - Partly to save money, filmmakers cast unknowns in the lead roles, although Scott Baio and Brooke Shields were originally considered. Some better-known actors and actresses (recognizable today, at least) appeared in the film, including Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky, and Kelly Preston. It was Preston’s third movie role; she was 20 during filming. Kevin Bacon, virtually unknown at the time, was offered the lead role of Arnie, but he chose to play Ren McCormack in the blockbuster Footloose instead. Well, that certainly worked out well.

10 - If watching Christine gives you a sense of déjà vu, it’s because director John Carpenter also filmed 1978’s Halloween in the same neighborhood in South Pasadena, California, five years earlier. (Incidentally, Carpenter refused to attend Christine’s premiere, thinking his presence might be bad luck.)",Fear on wheels: 10 things you may not know about Christine,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/27/fear-on-wheels-10-things-may-not-know-about-christine.html

The former head of the center, Mario DeSanctis, was fired in 2015 but fought his dismissal and eventually was allowed to resign, USA Today reported earlier this month. He and his lawyer were paid $163,000, it said.



An inspector general's report in 2015 found that Tomah VA doctors commonly overprescribed opioid painkillers, earning the facility the nickname ""Candy Land.""



Simcakoski, who was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2002, had been treated from 2006 to 2014 for a variety of conditions. He was admitted to the Tomah VA's acute psychiatric unit on Aug. 10, 2014, then transferred to a short stay unit.



On the morning of Aug. 30, 2014, he was so sedated he could barely speak, his family alleged in the lawsuit. He was found unresponsive that afternoon. He died after life-saving attempts were made, although they weren't started for about 10 minutes after he was found.



An autopsy determined that Simcakoski died from mixed drug toxicity. The inspector general found that doctors who prescribed his medications failed to talk with him about the risks, and noted delays in the start of CPR and the lack of medication at the Tomah VA to reverse drug overdoses.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts.
And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

The bill aims to close a loophole which currently leaves models open to potential harassment on the job from people such as photographers, designers and agency employees, Moneyish reports. Because models are typically classified as independent contractors, they are often excluded from standard employment protections, but this bill would provide them protection against sexual harassment.

“There’s no accountability when it comes to who ultimately has to respond to sexual harassment in the workplace,” Rozic said to Moneyish. “The bill addresses this loophole in the law by making it an unlawful practice for a modeling entity — whether it be this talent agency or management company — to subject a model to harassment, regardless of whether they’re an independent contractor or employee.”

Rozic’s bill, which was developed with New York-based advocacy group Model Alliance, would hold modeling agencies accountable for misconduct on the job.

I know that sounds dramatic, but it’s true. If someone figures out your email password, you’re in trouble. Social media? Even worse. Once hackers access your online bank account, they can wreck your finances, and you may feel the repercussions of that break-in for years.

It seems not a week goes by that we don’t hear about another data breach. How do you know if the hackers have your info? Click here to find out whether your email has been hacked or stolen.

Most of us have the wrong idea about passwords. We think they have to be convoluted messes, like F$%Th5l2K!&. This theory — that passwords should be nonsensical and hard to remember — reigned for years.

It started in 2003 with guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which insisted on random combinations of numbers, letters and symbols. The organization’s manager, Bill Burr, spread this gospel for years. But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he admitted that this wasn’t nearly as effective as he’d thought.

Thanks to a new round of research, cybersecurity experts have changed their tune. Yes, you should still avoid guessable passwords like “p@ssword1” or “letmein.” But a strong password also can be logical, fluid and easy to remember.

1. Passwords should withstand 100 guesses

This is the most important part: No matter what your password is, it should withstand 100 guesses, which means it shouldn’t be tied to any public information about you or your family.

Hackers often turn to your social media profiles to find information about you, such as your birthday and the name of your pet. And a little data goes a long way. Experts believe criminals can guess the average person's password nearly 73 percent of the time, and they can often access other accounts by using slight variations of the same password.

Facebook is all about making it easy to share your life with your friends and family. Unfortunately, there are some things you shouldn't share online. These bits of information can put you in danger of identity theft, losing your job or causing other major headaches. Click here for five of the biggest offenders you should not put on your profile.

2. Use a phrase

Instead of thinking of your password as a secret code, think of it as a “passphrase.” These are strings of words that are both easy to memorize but hard for anyone else to crack.

Suppose you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, and your favorite color is fuchsia. You have never mentioned these facts online, and only your mom knows such trivia about you. You could compose a passphrase like “ilikefuschiaastronauts.” You’ll never forget it, and the passphrase will confound hackers for (literally) centuries.

I told how to create a great passphrase a little over a year ago, and the advice is still valid. Go here to come up with your own.

3. Go long

You might want to sit down for this one: The new NIST guidelines suggest allowing users to create passwords up to 64 characters long. As if that isn’t weird enough, the guidelines also allow spaces between words. While many people just try to meet the minimum requirement of eight characters, you will get a much stronger password by stretching things out.

You could theoretically create a complex list or sentence, which still makes perfect sense to you. You could list all your pets’ names from childhood, like “fluffy princess rex spike booboo chewie,” or all the streets on the way to your favorite restaurant,

like “academy main washington ohio central.” Easy to remember. Hard to crack.

4. Don’t change your password until you have to

Until recently, consumers were advised to change their passwords every three months. But as NIST’s Paul Grassi recently told the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, “Expiration isn’t a motivator to create a brand-new password, it’s motivation to shift one character so you can remember the password.”

If you’ve created a strong password, then don’t worry about changing it out all the time. Just stick with it unless you’ve been notified of a security breach that requires a password reset.

5. Choose something memorable

Remember, all passwords should be unique, but they don’t have to be cumbersome. NIST calls passwords “memorized secrets.” You want to avoid the temptation to write them down, so pick passwords that mean something to you and will stay in your mind.

I’m not a big fan of password managers. I commit my passwords to memory. But if you cannot do that, here’s a free program that will help you store your passwords safely and easily.

6. Get creative with characters

It may take websites some time to catch up to the latest NIST guidelines, but you can still create a memorable password that meets current restrictions. Go back to Burr’s advice on passphrases. You might choose something like “ArizonaCardinalsfootballisnumber1!” or “Igivemyjob1000%everyday.” Those meet the requirements of having at least eight characters, a special character, and upper and lowercase letters.

7. Use two-factor identification

While passwords help protect your information, cybercriminals are more sophisticated than ever. If they break into your accounts, you may not recognize the damage until it’s too late.

Months passed before the public learned about the Equifax breach, and it’s hard to assess how much information was leaked and how it will be used. (If you haven’t checked to see if your personal details are in the hands of cybercrooks, click here and do it now.)

That’s why two-factor identification is so important. Using text messages, emails or special apps, an account-holder will receive a notification every time a password is changed, or when it’s entered on a new device or at a new location. You will have to verify that it’s you trying to gain access.

The Washington Post reported Saturday that a panel called the Players Coalition has requested a meeting Monday in Philadelphia with league Commissioner Roger Goodell, Houston Texans owner Bob McNair, and free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
Meanwhile, ESPN reported Saturday that the Houston Texans players were planning to stage an unspecified protest against McNair's remarks prior to Sunday's game against the Seahawks in Seattle.

The Washington Post reported Saturday that a panel called the Players Coalition has requested a meeting Monday in Philadelphia with league Commissioner Roger Goodell, Houston Texans owner Bob McNair, and free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

It wasn’t immediately clear if all parties had agreed to attend.

Meanwhile, ESPN reported Saturday that the Houston Texans players were planning to stage an unspecified protest against McNair's remarks prior to Sunday's game against the Seahawks in Seattle.

“Many players have been deeply troubled by the disturbing comments made by Texans' owner Bob McNair,” the Players Coalition said in a statement. “It is ironic that such a quote would emerge in the midst of an ongoing struggle to highlight injustices suffered by people of color, including our nation's deeply flawed approach to criminal justice and inhumane treatment of imprisoned people.”

McNair has apologized twice since making what he described as a “very regretful comment” during a recent league meeting about players’ national anthem protests. The comment was published in ESPN The Magazine.

But McNair insisted afterward that he wasn’t referring to the players as “inmates” when he said, “We can’t have the inmates running the prison.” Instead, he said, he was describing the relationship between team owners and the league office in New York.

Nevertheless, in a league on edge over race-related matters -- sparked in large part by Kaepernick’s 2016 protests against American society’s treatment of people of color – the “inmates” remark wasn’t accepted well.

Last season Kaepernick, who was with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling during the national anthem before games, saying he was protesting police killings of African-Americans. But many critics argued that protesting during the anthem was disrespectful to the nation and especially the members of the U.S. military.

After President Donald Trump made a veiled reference to Kaepernick as a “son of a bitch” during a September speech in Alabama, more players joined the protest – even though Kaepernick was out of the league by then.

In their statement, the players asserted that McNair’s remark suggested that some league officials were not taking their concerns seriously.

“As long as the prevailing reality of our league includes a culture where owners feel such behavior and language is permissible, our cause will continue to be stifled and progress will remain elusive,” the statement said. “This isn't about being a player or a club owner - but basic human decency.”

According to ESPN, the Players Coalition is led by Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, retired wide receiver Anquan Boldin and other players who are engaged in community activism.","NFL players seek meeting with Goodell, McNair, Kaepernick",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/29/nfl-players-seek-meeting-with-goodell-mcnair-kaepernick.html

Just a day after publisher Wenner Media said the magazine is up for sale, a New York federal appeals court has revived a defamation lawsuit against Rolling Stone over its debunked 2014 article about a University of Virginia gang rape.

Judge Katherine Forrest of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the lower court prematurely struck down claims from George Elias and Ross Fowler while correctly rejecting Stephen Hadford’s, according to The Hollywood Reporter. All three were former Phi Kappa Psi fraternity members and graduated from the school in 2013.

""While it is a close call, we conclude on balance that the complaint plausibly alleged that the purportedly defamatory statements in the Article were 'of and concerning' Elias and Fowler individually,"" she wrote in an opinion. ""At this stage of the litigation, Plaintiffs need only plead sufficient facts to make it plausible—not probable or even reasonably likely—that a reader familiar with each Plaintiff would identify him as the subject of the statements at issue. With regard to the Article, Elias and Fowler have met this burden.""

The debunked article described a student’s account of being raped by numerous fraternity members at their house in 2012. Authorities investigated claims by the woman in the article – who was identified as “Jackie” – and found them unsubstantiated.

Elias’ allegations that he was identifiable in the article because he lived in the fraternity house’s second floor – where the rape was reported to have happened – and had the only bedroom large enough to fit the description of the scene was enough for the appeals court, The Hollywood Reporter reported. The court also gave Fowler the benefit of the doubt over his allegations that he was identifiable because he was the fraternity’s rush chair and a frequent swimmer, it added. The article describes how the woman met one of the fraternity members at a pool and the rape was linked to its recruitment process.

Hadford’s claims did not survive scrutiny with the court, as his allegation that he was identifiable because he rode his bike around campus and the article said the woman saw ""one of the boys riding his bike on the grounds,” was not enough of a connection.

""There is no allegation that it is unusual for UVA alumni to bike through campus such that a reasonable reader familiar with Hadford’s biking habits would conclude that the Article plausibly referred to him,” The Hollywood Reporter cites the opinion as saying.

The 2nd Circuit court also ruled that a group defamation lawsuit from the entire fraternity could go forward, saying the headcount of its 53 members is “sufficiently small” to make a case.

The lower court had also agreed with that sentiment but reached a conclusion that the article didn’t explicitly state that the fraternity required all of its pledges to participate in a rape, The Hollywood Reporter reported.

Meanwhile, sources told the New York Post that the music, politics and pop culture magazine is struggling to attract potential buyers as consumers are increasingly straying away from purchasing glossy print titles at newsstands.

The players could decide to all kneel together, peel off the Texans decal off their helmets, or protest by raising their fists, the source told ESPN.

McNair's remarks caused a firestorm of criticism from athletes inside and outside the NFL and prompted an initial apology from the 79-year-old Friday.

The comment was published in an ESPN The Magazine story about two recent days of meetings among owners, players and others to discuss the protests that have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump.

Players, following the lead of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, say they kneel to protest social injustices, particularly against African-Americans. Trump has sharply criticized the protests and even called on NFL owners to fire players.

The meetings earlier this month did not result in a policy change that would require players to stand for the anthem. Owners and players are expected to meet again next week to discuss initiatives.

“If we can just be blessed with a continuation of this show, I think it would be wonderful,"" said Welch.","When Raquel Welch was offered the role of a grandmother who dates, loves the nightlife and gets caught by her granddaughters doing the “walk of shame,” the sultry screen siren didn’t hesitate to say yes.

The 77-year-old stars as Rosa on UP TV’s family-friendly sitcom “Date My Dad.” The show tells the story of Ricky Cooper, Rosa's son-in-law, who completely dedicates his life to fatherhood after losing his beloved wife Isabella.

But three years later, his three daughters are willing to do anything to see their father fall in love and find happiness again. Barry Watson, of “7th Heaven” fame, plays the comical patriarch who gets some much-needed help from his live-in mother-in-law.

“The minute I got the script, I just thought it was great fun,” Welch told Fox News. “And I loved the idea. It’s comedy. I’m good at comedy, if I can say so myself. And it’s something I enjoy doing. It was a no-brainer for me.""

""... I could be a grandmother myself. My children are not cooperating,"" she joked. ""But I am a mother and I have seen my son go through a marriage that failed… I was very interested and it’s not a real stretch for me…. I’m enjoying the whole darn thing.”

Welch was thrilled to be paired up with fellow actor Robert Wagner, Watson’s real-life father-in-law. The 87-year-old guest starred in “Date My Dad” as Welch’s love interest. She was eager to reunite with her former co-star from the 1968 comedy “The Biggest Bundle of Them All.”

“There wasn’t a particular rapport [in the movie] except, of course, he’s Robert Wagner and what’s not to like?” she explained. “We had a really good time... It seemed like a perfect match in a sense… I had no objection. What possibly could I object to? We had a lot of fun. And people seem to enjoy our interaction. It’s all been very enjoyable, I have to say.”

Welch is no stranger to working alongside Hollywood's most notable leading men. Back in 1964, she had the chance to work with her teenage crush in “Rousetabout” — Elvis Presley. However, Welch was surprised by the singer when she met him on set.

“I first saw him when I was 14 in a concert performance in San Diego, along with a whole bunch of screaming teenagers,"" explained Welch. ""He was pretty irresistible. I was just all a flutter as a young girl. But when I finally did meet him [on set], he just didn’t look the same. It looked like they cleaned him up.

""It was like white bread or something. It was not at all his kind of sassiness that he exhibited on stage. The way he wore his hair, the kind of clothes he wore, the way he moved. It was just all very polite now… What happened to the rebellious, sexy guy? I was so in love with him as a teenager.”

Welch would later see Presley again in Las Vegas, where he underwent another transformation.

“He was now wearing a lot of studded jumpsuits,” recalled Welch. “That was not the Elvis I was crazy about. He still sounded like Elvis, but there was such a difference about it. He didn’t sound like he was 100 percent. It was more like he was doing it for all his fans. He enjoyed the adulation, obviously. But it didn’t seem to me like his involvement in the earlier part of his career was there. He didn’t have the passion anymore. He just performed a tremendous amount.”

Presley died in 1977 at age 42. Welch wondered if his non-stop performing schedule contributed to his early demise.

A post shared by Elvis Presley (@elvis) on May 16, 2017 at 12:45pm PDT

“They just had him on a treadmill all the time, repeating every wonderful thing that he did,” she said. “And you could tell it was not fun for him anymore. It was a sad, sad thing that happened to him... I just think he was a nice Southern boy.”

Meanwhile, one co-star who left Welch speechless was Frank Sinatra. They both appeared in 1968’s “Lady in Cement.” She particularly remembered seeing the singer on stage at Miami’s Fontainebleau Hotel.

“You could hear a pin drop when he was singing a ballad,” said Welch. “[When] Frank came out on the stage, he had everybody eating out of his hand at about 37 seconds… He was just flawless. He could break your heart, make you fall in love with him or make you think he was a scamp… You could picture a whole existence around [his lyrics]… That’s what I discovered about Frank.”

These days, Welch is happily savoring the success of her lasting career, which is why she probably won’t take any advice from her new character Rosa.

“[But] I’m not really trying to date with any real seriousness,” said Welch. “You know, I go out occasionally but you know, it’s not a campaign that I’m on. I’m busy a lot and I like to work. I guess I’m in love with my life in general.

""It’s been a lot of fun. It’s been demanding, to a point. A lot of men don’t like that anyhow. They don’t like their lady to have other things that take precedent sometimes. They don’t particularly like that. That’s what women everywhere don’t want to hear, but unfortunately it does happen to be true. I’m kind of a realist.”

While UP TV hasn’t announced a Season 2 date for “Date My Dad"" quite yet, fans and curious viewers alike can stream the series online. Welch is yearning to meet up with her cast mates and see what new adventures Rosa will take her on.

“If we can just be blessed with a continuation of this show, I think it would be wonderful,"" said Welch.","Raquel Welch talks working with Robert Wagner, meeting Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/26/raquel-welch-talks-working-with-robert-wagner-meeting-elvis-presley-and-frank-sinatra.html

8:35 a.m.

Catalonia's main city Barcelona is bracing for a new day of protests over an independence declaration that led to the regional government's dismissal by Spain.

Societat Civil Catalan has called for those who oppose Catalan independence to march at noon Sunday (1100 GMT; 7 a.m. EDT).

Organizers say the march's goal is to defend Spain's unity and reject ""an unprecedented attack in the history of democracy."" Their slogan will be ""We are all Catalonia. Common sense for coexistence!"" Members of the central government and main pro-union parties are expected to join.

Three weeks ago, the same group organized a mass rally that brought hundreds of thousands onto Barcelona's streets.

Somalia's government has fired the country's police and intelligence chiefs in the wake of Saturday's deadly extremist attack which killed at least 23 people and wounded more than 30 others.

A statement from the Prime Minister's office issued Sunday said police chief Abdullahi Mohamed Ali and Gen. Abdihakim Said were sacked after the cabinet voted to drop both officials.

The firings came after Somali security forces ended a night-long siege at a Mogadishu hotel by five extremist attackers who stormed the building after a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the entrance gate on Saturday afternoon. The attack killed 23 people.

Troops regained control of the Nasa-Hablod hotel on Sunday morning, having killed three attackers and captured two alive, said Capt. Mohamed Hussein.

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

The sentence the military judge will impose on Tali-Bowe Bergdahl isn’t about one self-centered deserter. It’s about our national defense. The judge’s decision will decide the state of discipline on battlefields for decades to come. Bergdahl has been charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. He has pleaded guilty to both charges.

He must be punished, for his crimes and to make an example of him.

Yet, the American left, which has had only two military heroes since 9/11 (Bergdahl and Chelsea Manning), continues to embrace Bergdahl’s very tall tale that he only meant to stroll a dozen or so miles through hostile territory to the next military base so he could report on conditions is his unit—which Bergdahl found unsatisfactory. Based upon the evidence available to this writer, Bergdahl intended to go over to the enemy, whom he had expected to welcome him.

Bergdahl will never be commemorated for his judgment or analytical skills.

The left, exemplified by former President Obama’s White House celebration for the Bergdahls after he gave up five terrorists and, reportedly, cash for their traitor-son, has never grasped why anyone would join our military—a domain of brutes, illiterates, psychopaths and “deplorables.” But leftists do understand why soldiers would desert or betray our country by revealing our secrets.",Bergdahl Sentencing Isn't About Him -- It's About Setting an Example for Any Future Traitors,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/27/bergdahl-sentencing-isnt-about-him-its-about-setting-example-any-future-traitors

The number-crunching which followed was automatic. The results were unusual.

This object is in an odd position. It’s moving very fast. And it’s in what appears to be a somewhat extreme orbit. Extreme enough not to actually be an orbit, in fact.

Observations published by the by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center (MPC) suggest it could have come from deep space.

Specifically, it could be a comet that has escaped another star.

“If further observations confirm the unusual nature of this orbit, this object may be the first clear case of an interstellar comet,” the MPC declares.

WHAT IS C/2017 U1?

The PanSTARRS telescope spotted the object only after it was flung back out towards the stars by our Sun.

It’s not likely to ever return. It flashed past Earth at 24 million kilometres on October 14.

Many eyes watched it closely, keen to determine exactly what it was. Their curiosity was piqued by where it had come from.

Most objects orbiting our Sun do so along a common plane: the planets, dwarf planets and asteroids mostly swing around in roughly the same way.

This one appears to have come down on the plane from 122 degrees, from the direction of the star Vega, in the constellation Lyra. And its path did not indicate the curved ellipse typical of clockwork-like returning comets.

Best guesstimates make it a comet of about 160m diameter, with a surface reflectivity (albedo) of about 10 per cent.

A WANDERER

The object has just been through a close call (in Solar System terms): it came within 38 million km of our star before its momentum and the Sun’s gravity hurled it back outward.

Normally such a close pass would be fatal. But C/2017U1 was travelling too fast for the Sun’s heat to consume it.

It was moving at 26km per second when first observed.

Astronomers are now attempting to refine their observations and data to pinpoint exactly where it came from. If it truly is of interstellar origin, the next task is to find which star it is likely to have come from.

At the moment, it appears to have been somewhere in the direction of the star Vega.

It’s also likely to have been wandering, alone, in deep space for a very, very long time.

Vega is a relatively close neighbour of our Sun at 25 light years distance. At the speed it’s travelling, it would take about 1.7 million years to cross the interstellar divide.

In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times published on Saturday, Carter seemed to ally himself with Trump, criticizing the media for its coverage of the new administration.

""I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I've known about,"" Carter told . ""I think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.""

In addition, Carter also aligned himself with Trump on the issue of whether or not football players should stand while the national anthem is being played before games. Trump reignited the controversy in late September when he urged football coaches to bench players who chose to protest against racial injustice in the country by kneeling instead of standing during the anthem. Since then, National Football League ratings have plummeted while many sports fans expressed their disapproval of kneeling during the anthem and politicizing a patriotic tradition.

""I think they ought to find a different way to object, to demonstrate. I would rather see all the players stand during the American anthem,"" Carter said.

The former president also pushed back against one of the prevailing narratives Democrats and liberal-leaning media outlets have pushed in the days following Trump's astonishing Election Day victory: whether or not the Russians affected voting outcomes. In addition, Carter said he wasn't bothered particularly with Trump's desire to cultivate a stronger and more diplomatic relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""At the Carter Center,"" the former president said, ""we deal with Putin and the Russians quite frequently concerning Syria.""

Carter added: ""I don't think there's any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes, or any votes"" during the 2016 presidential election.

Noting that he and his wife, Rosalynn, both voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the primaries, Carter didn't have many kind words to offer the Clintons. When The Times' Maureen Dowd compared the Carter Center to the Clinton Foundation, Carter bristled.

""Rosie and I put money in the Carter Center. We never take any out,"" Carter noted.

The Times appeared surprised that Carter ""was harder on [former President Barack] Obama during the interview than he was on Trump."" Although Carter said, ""I don't care if [Obama] gets rich or Clinton gets rich"" earning hundreds of thousands of dollars per speeches they give, he appeared to frown on making money that way.

""But I announced when I was defeated I was not going to be on corporate boards, I was not going to try to enrich myself with speeches. I was patterning my policy after Harry Truman,"" Carter said.

Carter knocked Obama on his foreign policy as president, saying that Obama ""made some very wonderful statements, in my opinion, when he first got in office, and then he reneged on that."" Although the former president said that Trump may be ""escalating"" a negative image of the U.S. among the rest of the world, Carter argued, ""but I think that precedes Trump.""

Saying that Obama ""refused"" to talk to North Korea and push for a solution to the nuclear crisis, Carter offered some approval for Trump's more direct and forceful approach. Carter even offered to help Trump by going to North Korea himself to engage in diplomatic relations.

""I would go, yes,"" Carter said. ""I'm afraid, too, of a situation ... I don't know what they'll do. Because they want to save their regime.""

Carter said that he spoke with Trump's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, earlier in the year.

""I told him that I was available if they ever need me,"" Carter said.

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html
