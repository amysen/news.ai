The threat of nuclear attack from North Korea is increasing, US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday.

Mattis warned Pyongyang that its military was no match for the US-South Korean alliance, and that diplomacy was most effective “when backed by credible military force.”

“North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbours and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs,” he said, according to the Associated Press.

The Commons leader said on Monday it was “not true” that the prime minister turned a blind eye to the behaviour of her MPs.

It came as she announced parliament needs a new independent body to protect MPs’ staff from abuse and unwanted attention.

Leadsom’s statement in the Commons followed allegations that MPs and ministers were guilty of inappropriate behaviour towards younger female and male staff.

International trade minister Mark Garnier is under investigation after he admitted asking his secretary to buy sex toys for him.

May has written to John Bercow to call for a mediation service to be set up to deal with complaints.

But the Commons Speaker said today it was up to party leaders, including the prime minister, to “live up to their responsibilities” to “adopt an effective grievance scheme”.

Guido Fawkes and The Times revealed a dossier complied by parliamentary staff detailing the inappropriate behaviour of Tory MPs - including cabinet ministers - towards staff.

The staff who work for the 650 MPs in Westminster are employed directly by their MP - not by parliamentary authorities.

The Sunday Times reported Chief Whip Gavin Williamson gives the prime minister “weekly updates about the sexual indiscretions” of Tory MPs - a charge Leadsom denied.

Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, told the Commons there was “obviously a problem” with a “sleazy” and “toxic” atmosphere in Westminster.

“No woman, or man for that matter, moving to work in this House should be subject to unwanted sexual advances from those who are in a position of power,” she said. “It has to be stopped and now is the time to do it.”

Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said one member of staff had made a complaint but authorities “did nothing” leaving her “deeply disappointed ad distressed”

Leadsom said the current system for dealing with complaints had been shown to be “inadequate”.

“There can be no place for harassment, abuse, or misconduct in politics,” the Leader of the Commons told MPs. “There is a vital need to provide better support and protection of the thousands of staff members working in Westminster and in constituency offices.”

She said the bar for MPs being disciplined for sexual harassment should be “significantly below” criminal behaviour.

Labour MP Tulip Siddiq said the number of misconduct cases in Westminster could run into “the hundreds”.

In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has written to Ken Macintosh, the presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament, to ask that there is a “zero tolerance” approach to harassment in Holyrood.","Theresa May 'Not Covering Up' Allegations Of Sexual Harassment By Tory MPs, Says Andrea Leadsom",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/westminster-needs-independent-body-to-deal-with-sexual-harassment-claims-says-andrea-leadsom_uk_59f72994e4b03cd20b82f8e7

Einstein’s scribbled message also aligns with a growing “new economy” movement that points out that our current form of capitalism, which puts the pursuit of success and profit as top priorities, is not only leading to unprecedented environmental destruction but is also increasing social inequality.

A timely reminder of this has come this week thanks to the auction in Israel of a small note that the physicist Albert Einstein gave to a Japanese courier in 1922.

“A quiet and modest life brings more joy than a pursuit of success bound with constant unrest,” the note written on Imperial Hotel Tokyo stationery reads.

The note comes to light as more people are starting to reevaluate what success actually means and the purpose behind their increasingly fast-moving and complex lives.

Einstein’s scribbled message also aligns with a growing “new economy” movement that points out that our current form of capitalism, which puts the pursuit of success and profit as top priorities, is not only leading to unprecedented environmental destruction but is also increasing social inequality.

That inequality is one reason why people do not appear to be happier despite an expanding economy.

In a study of 16 developed countries, Selin Kesebir, assistant professor of Organisational Behaviour at London Business School, found that when income inequality is high, an increase in gross domestic product per capita was “virtually unrelated to life satisfaction.”

Writing in the Harvard Business Review, she concluded that “what we can say for sure is that it’s a fallacy to equate GDP with well-being. It’s not a foregone conclusion that growing the economy will make for a happier people.”

She also points to the data which shows that despite the post-war economic boom in America between 1946 and 1970, surveys showed no improvement in happiness.

That remains true today, with a United Nations World Happiness Study released in March 2017 showing that while the U.S. ranked third for happiness among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2007, it had fallen to 19th by 2016.

That’s not surprising when you see that the U.S. is facing an unprecedented opioid addiction crisis, while research presented at the American Psychological Association convention in August showed that loneliness and social isolation may represent a greater public health hazard than obesity and is getting worse.

Meanwhile, new analysis unveiled earlier this year showed that Americans are experiencing mental health problems in record numbers.

Some economists, such as the U.K.’s Kate Raworth and Tim Jackson, are calling for a complete rethink in the way we measure success, moving away from an obsession with GDP growth towards broader measures of wellness that include data on happiness and social stability.

Spiritual leaders are also recommending a fundamental change in the way success is measured and point out that our desires for success tend to lead only to suffering.

Pope Francis has issued several scathing critiques of the current capitalist system.

“Let us not be afraid to say it: we want change, real change, structural change,” the pope said, during a speech in Bolivia in 2015. He added that the capitalist system “has imposed the mentality of profit at any price, with no concern for social exclusion or the destruction of nature.”

This system is by now intolerable: farm workers find it intolerable, laborers find it intolerable, communities find it intolerable, peoples find it intolerable. The earth itself – our sister, Mother Earth, as Saint Francis would say – also finds it intolerable.

Zen Buddhist Master Thich Nhat Hanh also echoes Einstein’s words of wisdom. “If you have a healthy desire, such as a wish to protect life, or protect the environment, or live a simple life with time to take care of yourself and your beloved ones, your desire will bring you to happiness,” he writes in his 2001 book “Calming the Fearful Mind.”

Nguyen Huy Kham / Reuters Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh

“If you run after power, wealth, sex and fame, thinking that they will bring you happiness, you are consuming a very dangerous type of food and it will bring you a lot of suffering. You can see this is true just by looking around you,” he added.

Nhat Hanh recounted speaking with a business leader running a global company with more than 300,000 employees.

“He shared that people who are very rich are often extremely lonely because they are suspicious of others,” he wrote. “They think anyone who approaches them in friendship only does so because of their money and only wants to take advantage of them. They feel they do not have any real friends.”

The corporate world is starting to wake up to Einstein’s idea that a focus only on the pursuit of success can lead to constant unrest.

The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which represents more than 200 of the world’s largest corporations, has been carrying out research into what it terms the “The Good Life.”

Its recommendations very much fit into Einstein’s note. Julian Hill-Landolt, the council’s director of Sustainable Lifestyles, calls on brands to “rethink the picture of the world that they paint through their advertising. We’re not asking them to stop selling their products, we’re just asking them to stop selling their products in a world that is all about bigger, faster, and more.”

“The [Good Life] Playbook shows how people are already taking pleasure from a different type of world, one where time with friends and family, health and good food are all luxuries to aspire to,” he said. “At the end of the day, this isn’t rocket science. We’re suggesting that forward-looking brands should check the structural integrity of their messaging.”

It can sometimes seem an impossible task for those that are seeking to transform the capitalist system, and help move away from the mantra of short-termism and profit maximization.

But for those who may start to lose hope that it is possible to create an economic system that generates prosperity for all within environmental limits, Einstein has another piece of wisdom that is worth remembering.","Environmental Destruction, Inequality And Loneliness.

Eine Erklärung dafür seht ihr auch im Video oben

Es geschah mitten in einem Fußballspiel vergangenen Jahres im amerikanischen Atlanta. Reuben Nsemoh verlor nach dem Tritt eines Gegenspielers gegen den Kopf sein Bewusstsein. Sein Trainer sagte dem Nachrichtensender WSB-TV, dass der damals 16-jährige nicht mehr geatmet habe.

Als er kurzzeitig wieder bei Bewusstsein war, habe er mehrere Krämpfe erlitten, ehe ihn Sanitäter ins Krankenhaus einlieferten. Daraufhin fiel er drei Tage lang ins Koma.

Als er erwachte, konnte Reuben kein Wort Englisch mehr, obwohl er das seit seiner Kindheit gesprochen hatte. Stattdessen sprach auf einmal fließend Spanisch.

Er sprach plötzlich eine andere Sprache

Seine Eltern versicherten, dass er zuvor kein Wort Spanisch konnte. Gänzlich unbekannt war dem Teenager die Fremdsprache allerdings davor nicht, erzählte er etwas später dem lokalen Radiosender WSB in einem Interview. ""Meine Freunde haben immer auf Spanisch mit mir geredet und wollten es mir so beibringen."" Gemocht habe er die fremde Sprache aber nie.

Was ihm widerfuhr, ist kein Einzelfall

Was wie ein Wunder klingt, ist allerdings kein Einzelfall: In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten gab es immer wieder Fälle, in denen Menschen plötzlich fließend eine nie erlernte Sprache sprachen. Das sogenannte Fremdsprachen-Akzent-Syndrom tritt normalerweise nach einem Schlaganfall oder einem Schädel-Hirn-Trauma auf.

Und das amerikanische “Time“-Magazin berichtete von einer Texanerin, die sogar nach einer Kieferoperation auf einmal mit einem britischen Akzent sprach.

Als die Ärzte Reubens Gehirnscans anschauten, prophezeiten sie, dass der Teenager sich wieder erholen würde. So kam es auch. Einige Wochen, nachdem Reuben wieder aus dem Koma erwacht war, konnte er sich wieder auf Englisch ausdrücken. Sein Spanisch wurde immer holpriger.

Heute hat er sich vollständig erholt. Er darf in Zukunft aber nur noch mit einem Kopfschutz das Tor seines Vereins hüten.","Jugendlicher wacht aus dem Koma auf und kann plötzlich Dinge, die er vorher nicht konnte",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/28/jugendlicher-koma-fahigkeiten_n_18407188.html?utm_hp_ref=germany#comments

Spacey responded swiftly, saying ""if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour."" He then goes on to confirm that he is now ""living as a gay man.""

Let us not examine too closely the details of the alleged assault, which involved Spacey carrying Rapp on to a bed and then lying on top of him, but instead focus on what is so wrong with Spacey's statement, a form of words which bears only a passing resemblance to an apology.

Spacey claims that he does not remember the incident and here we must give him the benefit of the doubt, although failure to recall assaulting a child does seem odd for someone whose job involves remembering lines. Yet, by using the phrase 'if I did behave...' implies that the incident may not have happened, introducing the possibility that his accuser may be lying. Not a good start Kevin - especially as Rapp has discussed the incident with friends and family over the years. You've managed to make the story about yourself, with no more than a passing nod to the pain caused to Anthony Rapp.

We then come to the first excuse, Spacey's self-confessed 'drunken behaviour'. I don't know about you, but many people I know sometimes get drunk. I have to admit that even I have occasionally had one too many at a party. And, yes, I accept that, when drunk, we sometimes say and do stupid things. But sexually assaulting a minor is not something that can be excused by too many G&Ts, and describing his own behaviour as 'inappropriate' is unacceptably dismissive. 'Inappropriate drunken behaviour', Mr Spacey, doesn't begin to cover it.

Sadly, in the age of Weinstein and those who, inevitably, will follow, the fact of the alleged assault is no surprise to me. I have no doubt that allegations against Weinstein, and now Spacey, represent the tip of the iceberg. What is especially galling is Spacey's implication that being 'in the closet' somehow contributed to his behaviour, and that because he is now 'living as a gay man' he is coming to terms with his past and 'examining [his] own behaviour'.

As the publisher of lesbian title DIVA and LGBT+ news site OutNews Global, I can confirm that Spacey's sexuality has been an open secret for years. Choosing when, or if, to come out is a matter for the individual, and it is not for the press to 'out' people, unless we are exposing the hypocrisy of public figures (for example MPs who vote against LGBT equality while gay themselves). But by addressing the allegations and admitting his sexuality at the same time, Spacey has given new life to the age old homophobic trope that male homosexuality and paedophilia are somehow connected. This can only fuel the fires of homophobia which, let's face it, is unhelpful in a world of Trump, the rise of the European far right, and the horrific suicide figures relating to LGBT+ youth. It's bad enough for young people to have to struggle with their sexuality to the detriment of their mental health, but throw in a connection between child abuse and homosexuality, and Spacey is not only guilty of the alleged assault, but of linking a perfectly normal sexual orientation with a predilection to child molestation.

Many people I know have come out in the face of huge adversity, facing many hardships, yet have been true to themselves and faced down whatever difficulties their coming out has presented. For Spacey to acknowledge his sexuality only after it has been exposed reinforces the view that being gay is something to be ashamed about. It is clear to me that Spacey has many things about which to be ashamed, but his sexuality is not one of them.

Spacey, Weinstein and those who will follow put the parents of aspiring performers in a quandary. I have twins, one of which wishes to become an actress. Were my daughter, or anyone else, to follow their dream and wish to seek fame and fortune in Hollywood, they'll be looking to work in an industry where the abuse of power - almost always by rich men - is endemic, and often finds its form in sexual harassment, abuse and rape. As long as people like Kevin Spacey try to excuse their misdeeds as somehow a result of too much alcohol, being in the closet or both, Hollywood remains a place where young men and women either have to risk being abused to succeed, have their careers ruined for refusing sex (as has been alleged in the case of Harvey Weinstein) or have to forget about their career aspirations and do something else instead.

Kevin Spacey is a powerful figure in American movies and on the London stage. He had an opportunity to do the right thing... to apologise unreservedly and to accept what Rapp's allegations. Instead, he has issued an apology so feeble it hardly counts as an apology, and has succeeded in conflating child abuse with being gay.

It's too late for Anthony Rapp, but not too late for Spacey to make amends. I urge him to rethink and to apologise properly.",Kevin Spacey's Coming Out Story Will Go Down In History As The Worst Ever,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/linda-riley/kevin-spacey-statement-_b_18420122.html

Chhattisgarh PWD Minister Rajesh Munat has filed a complaint against state Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel and senior journalist Vinod Verma for allegedly tarnishing his image through a ""fake"" sex CD.

A case was registered last evening at the Civil Lines police station here against Baghel, Verma and others under section 67 (A) of the Information Technology Act following the minister's complaint, Station House Officer (SHO), Civil Lines, Hem Prakash Nayak told PTI.

""A copy of the CD has been submitted to the police station and it will be sent for forensic examination,"" he said.

Munat, considered close to Chief Minister Raman Singh, was accompanied by state BJP president Dharam Lal Kaushik, his over half-a-dozen cabinet colleagues and other party leaders, while filing the complaint.

Former BBC Journalist Vinod Verma was arrested by the Chhattisgarh police from his Ghaziabad residence early Friday morning on the charge of him blackmailing a Chhattisgarh Minister with a sex CD, on October 27, 2017 in Ghaziabad.

Talking to reporters yesterday, Munat had alleged that the CD in question was fake and urged the chief minister to order a probe to find the truth.

""The (sex) CD is fake. It is an attempt to malign my image,"" he had said.

The minister further appealed to the chief minister and Kaushik to get the matter investigated from any agency.

Yesterday, the Civil Line police had also arrested two AAP supporters for allegedly blackening Munat's nameplate while protesting outside his official residence over the row.

Verma, who was arrested in connection with an extortion and blackmailing case from Ghaziabad by Chhattisgarh police yesterday, had claimed that he had a sex CD of the Chhattisgarh minister.

Police also claimed to have recovered 500 ""porn"" CDs, a pen drive and a laptop from Verma.

A Ghaziabad court had granted the Chhattisgarh Police the transit remand of Verma till October 30 and he is expected to reach Raipur this afternoon.","Complaint Against Chhattisgarh Congress Chief Bhupesh Baghel, Journalist Vinod Verma Over 'Fake' Sex CD",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/28/complaint-against-chhattisgarh-congress-chief-bhupesh-baghel-journalist-vinod-verma-over-fake-sex-cd_a_23259184/

In a report surfaced in a newspaper, a couple from Lausanne in Switzerland was allegedly brutally thrashed by a group of youth in Agra's Fatehpur Sikri on Sunday.

The duo was reportedly seriously injured in the attack and is currently admitted in a hospital in Delhi.

The Swiss pair has alleged that they were followed by a group of people while ambling near the railway station.

Later, the group started passing comments at them and forced the couple to stop and take selfies. The group's harassment soon turned violent and they suffered critical injuries.

The Labor government will fulfil an election promise on Wednesday when it submits a bill proposing the records of people convicted for consensual homosexual activity be expunged.

WA decriminalised homosexuality in March 1990 but people must apply to have a spent conviction, which could affect employment, overseas travel and adopting a child.

Mr McGowan said his government had made an election commitment to ensure no government policies directly or indirectly discriminated against the LGBTIQ community.

""This is simply about righting the wrongs of the past,"" he said in a statement.

""These acts should never have been considered a criminal offence and the people impacted should never have had a criminal record against their names.""

The proposed laws will allow people to apply to have their record expunged while families of those who have died may do so on their behalf.

The premier will also deliver a formal apology on behalf of parliament.

""We can't change the past but I hope the apology will offer some comfort to those impacted by the old laws,"" Mr McGowan said.

Attorney General John Quigley said the legislation would bring WA into line with other states.

Witz über Weinstein

Es ist nicht der einzige Fall von Sexismus, der Großbritanniens Politik derzeit beschäftigt. Umweltminister Michael Gove entschuldigte sich am Samstag für einen Witz über den Hollywood-Produzenten Harvey Weinstein, wie die britische Ausgabe der HuffPost berichtet.

Gove sagte in einer Radioshow, sich auf ein Interview mit dem Journalisten John Humphrys einzulassen, sei ""wie in Harvey Weinsteins Schlafzimmer zu gehen - man kann nur beten, dass die Würde intakt bleibt.""

Weinstein wird von dutzenden Frauen beschuldigt, sie sexuell belästigt oder vergewaltigt zu haben. Gove sprach von einem ""ungeschickten"" Versuch, einen Witz zu machen.

Arbeits- und Rentenminister Stephen Crabb wird vorgeworfen, einer 19-Jährigen ""explizite"" Nachrichten nach einem Vorstellungsgespräch geschickt zu haben.

Netflix also said in a statement that it was ""deeply troubled"" about an allegation made against Spacey by actor Anthony Rapp who said Spacey had made a sexual advance to him in 1986, when Rapp was 14 years old.

Netflix did not give an explicit reason for deciding to air one more season of ""House of Cards"" before pulling the plug on the Emmy-winning, critically acclaimed show, its first original hit series.

But Netflix spokeswoman Karen Barragan said the decision was made months ago, long before the allegation surfaced against Spacey, 58, a two-time Oscar-winning film star, Tony-winning stage performer and former creative director of London's famed Old Vic theater.

The streaming service's statement read in part, ""In response to last night's revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.""

Spacey said in a Twitter post on Sunday that he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear Rapp's story of the encounter, which he said he did not remember. He wrote that he owed Rapp a ""sincere apology"" for what he said would have been ""deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.""

A representative for Spacey did not immediately respond to Reuters for comment.

In an interview with BuzzFeed, Rapp, now 46, recounted attending a party hosted by Spacey in which the older actor picked him up, brought him to a bed and lay down on top of him after other guests had left.

According to Rapp, the young actor had the impression Spacey was drunk, pushed him away and left.

I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out 1/3 — Anthony Rapp (@albinokid) October 30, 2017

Spacey, who has won Oscars for the films ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""American Beauty,"" also said that Rapp's story ""had encouraged me to address other things in my life.""

""In my life I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I now choose to live life as a gay man,"" Spaceywrote.

""I want to deal with this honestly and openly,"" he said, ""and that starts with me examining my own behavior.""

The actor for years had declined to publicly discuss his sexuality.

Rapp, who went on to star in the hit Broadway musical ""Rent,"" was starting his career on Broadway at the time of the alleged incident, appearing in a production of ""Precious Sons"" with Ed Harris and Judith Ivey. Spacey was then on stage with Jack Lemmon in a revival of the Eugene O'Neill play ""Long Day's Journey Into Night.""

""He was trying to seduce me,"" Rapp told BuzzFeed of the encounter with Spacey. ""I don't know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.""

Rapp said on Twitter overnight that he had decided to come forward and tell his story, ""standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out ... to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me.""

Everything he wanted to say about the experience had been covered in the interview, Rapp tweeted, adding that he had no further comment to make.

Some on social media expressed anger at Spacey's conflation of an apology for sexual misconduct and a public acknowledgement of being gay.

Hollywood and some top U.S. companies have been rocked in recent weeks by allegations from scores of women that executives had sexually harassed or assaulted them.

American movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including some who said they were raped.

Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. He has since been fired as chief executive of The Weinstein Company, which he co-founded and which has been one of Hollywood's most influential forces since its launch in October 2005.

Cette décision tombe juste après les accusations de harcèlement sexuel portées à l'encontre de l'acteur principal. Dans une interview diffusée dimanche par Buzzfeed, l'acteur Anthony Rapp, 46 ans aujourd'hui mais seulement 14 à l'époque, a raconté comment Kevin Spacey, 26 ans alors, lui était tombé dessus et lui avait fait des avances, ivre, à la fin d'une soirée dans son appartement de Manhattan. Anthony Rapp a expliqué avoir réussi à se dégager et a se retirer dans la salle de bains pour reprendre ses esprits avant de quitter les lieux.

""Honnêtement je ne me souviens pas de cet incident, qui remonterait à plus de 30 ans, a réagi Kevin Spacey, 58 ans, qui vit entre Londres, New York et Los Angeles.

La série ""House of Cards"", une adaptation d'une série britannique et du roman de Michael Dobbs du même nom, a été particulièrement importante dans l'histoire de Netflix. Dans ce drame politique primé à de multiples reprises aux Emmy Awards, Kevin Spacey interprète Frank Underwood, un politicien ambitieux prêt à tout faire pour atteindre le pouvoir, en compagnie de son épouse Claire, jouée par Robin Wright.

Over the weekend, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar congratulated Harindra Kumar Singh, a retired school principal from the Bhojpur district, who returned dowry worth ₹4 lakh which he received for his young son.

Speaking to the Telegraph, Singh said, ""Ours is a religious family and we discussed among ourselves to return the ₹4 lakh given to us in cash as dowry. We had not demanded dowry, but the bride's family gave it to us to cover wedding expenses.""

Singh's elder son Rajeev told the newspaper that the bride's family members ""had tears of happiness and relief in their eyes after we told them why we were returning the money.

On the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi earlier this month, Kumar launched a statewide campaign to end the evil practices of dowry and child marriage in Bihar.

On Sunday, Kumar met with the 60-year-old school principal at his residence on Aney Marg in Patna. The chief minister reportedly greeted Singh with a hug and promised to attend his son's wedding ceremony.

The Telegraph reported that Singh will be the mascot of the Bihar government's anti-dowry campaign. ""The step taken by Harindra to return the dowry will set an example for the society,"" said Kumar in a press release.

""We will ensure his active participation in the campaign against child marriage and dowry across the state,"" he said.

The Adani Group's proposed Carmichael megamine will be Australia's largest ever coal mine. The plans for the site are expected to include six open cut pits, numerous underground mines and coal to be transported 200 kilometres to a terminal at Abbott Point, adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.

While a 'Four Corners' report earlier in October raised further doubt about the activities and legitimacy of the Adani family in India as an environmental management entity, in May the Climate Council also labelled the mine a potential disaster for the Great Barrier Reef, people's health, and for the warming climate, while creating a net loss of jobs overall due to opportunities foregone in the renewables sector.

On Monday night, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd also took aim at the proposed mine with a focus on climate change, warning Australians to ""be very sceptical indeed"".

""Whatever we think about what was achieved at the Paris conference, if that is implemented fully, fingers crossed -- then that's one-third of what is necessary in terms of greenhouse gas reductions in order to keep temperature increases within two degrees centigrade this century,"" he said.

""So therefore, the prism I take on this thing is for God's sake when it comes to future coal mines, be very sceptical indeed. And the big danger we see globally, and let's step back a bit not just from fortress Australia -- is that Indian companies, Chinese companies and Korean companies, South Korean companies represent 70 percent of the global investment in new coal mines across the world.

""Often dirtier, much dirtier than the ones we're talking about up here. My reservations are about coal period.""

The former Labor Party leader also then went on to join Jones in criticising the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility's (NAIF) $1 billion funding of a proposed 388km-long Adani rail line that would connect the Galilee Basin to the Abbott Point coal terminal.

""A billion dollars from this [NAIF] is wrong, wrong, wrong,"" Rudd said.

""If this thing was to stack up environmentally or commercially -- commercially it seems not to --, then there is no place whatsoever for the Federal Government to be throwing a billion dollars of public funds by way of a possible loan.

""And then at the same time saying that any government subsidy in the future for renewable energies is simply unsustainable. That's rank hypocrisy on the core question for the future, which is climate.""

The proposed Carmichael mine has been a politically unpopular idea for months, with some saying taxpayer money shouldn't be spent on the construction of the rail link and others organising dozens of national day of action events to voice concerns over the economic and environmental impacts the mine could have.

The Adani Group plans to use the mine to import 60 million tonnes of coal from Australia annually and Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has consistently pushed the message that the project will bring 10,000 jobs to the region.

Despite this, Queensland's land court has been told the economic modelling provided as part of the environmental impact statement ""overstated"" the number of likely jobs and Adani's own consultants put the figure at just 1,464 jobs.",Alan Jones Cries Conspiracy Over Adani's Carmichael Coal Mine,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/30/alan-jones-cries-conspiracy-over-adanis-carmichael-coal-mine_a_23260455/

Als Berater und Coach hätte ich doch viel mit erfolgreichen Menschen zu tun, bzw. mit Menschen, die ihren Erfolg sichern, stärken oder noch weiter ausbauen wollen. Da ist es doch irgendwie naheliegend, auch einmal über Erfolg und Erfolgsstreben zu schreiben.

Ich war sofort begeistert. Doch bald darauf kamen Zweifel hoch. Warum soll ich über Erfolg schreiben, das tun doch ohnehin schon so viele. Ich sah plötzlich überall Erfolgsstories - Geschichten, die einen in den Bann der Welt strahlender Erfolge zu ziehen versuchen, bzw. in welcher ich mich selbst, in Konkurrenz mit all den anderen auch schon ins rechte Licht zu rücken suche. In diesem, meinen Zweifel trat Florian Böhm vor mein geistiges Auge. In diesem Moment wusste ich, das ist jener Mensch, der mir Erfolg in einer Weise zeigt, die mich berührt. Er verkörpert für mich jenen Erfolg, einen stillen Erfolg, den ich als Weg der Einsichten bezeichnen würde.

Erfolgsfaktoren

Egal ob KünstlerInnen, Führungskräfte und ManagerInnen, Bürofachkräfte, FacharbeiterInnen, VerkäuferInnen, oder Vater/Mutter von 2 Kindern, ... - jeder, jede will in irgend einer Weise, das was er/sie tut, erfolgreich tun - so auch Florian Böhm. Er ist 1975 geboren, hat in seiner Kindheit und Jugend intensiv Klavier gespielt und auch komponiert - was u.a. einer seiner Lehrer nicht ernst genommen hat. Florian war jedoch nicht nur am Klavier kreativ und begabt, sondern auch darüber hinaus, sprich multidimensional, fachübergreifend schöpferisch und einfallsreich! So war es ihm möglich, später mit einem Studium der Rechtswissenschaften sehr erfolgreich selbstständig zu werden - weniger, weil er das Recht und die Steuerlandschaft so gut beherrschte, was er selbstverständlich auch tut, sondern weil er mit seinem Einfallsreichtum Unternehmen tatkräftig, visionär und einfallsreich an die Hand nehmen und führen konnte. Aktuell konzentriert sich Florian wieder mehr auf seine Tätigkeiten als Künstler.

[...] Rausholen, was in mir steckt. [...]

Das war kein leichter Schritt. Er musste entscheiden, sprich weiterhin als Steuerberater im Alltag seiner Steuer- & Unternehmensberatung erfolgreich tätig sein, oder den Schritt wagen, diese Schaffensphase hinter sich zu lassen und zu 100% als Künstler im Leben zu stehen.

Florian und ich haben ziemlich lange über seinen Weg, seine Entwicklung bzw. im Sinne seiner Schreibweise < ENT.wicklung > gesprochen, die er für sich als „ "" bezeichnen will.

Im Folgenden werde ich abwechselnd Worte und Werke von Florian heranziehen, um sichtbar werden zu lassen, was ihn bewegt und was er unter Erfolg versteht, und meine persönliche Interpretation zu seinen Aussagen anführen, das was in mir durch ihn berührt ist. Dabei kommt mir gleich seine Aussage über Angst ins Gedächtnis.

Erfolg durch Überwindung von Ängsten

[...] Nicht die Ängste, sondern das, was ich aus der Angst mache und wie ich mit ihr umgehe, ist entscheidend. [...]

Erfolg ist die Überwindung von Ängsten, von vorgefassten Meinungen, von eigenen, wie auch fremd aufgebürdeten Grenzen und gleichzeitig das verantwortungsbewusste Respektieren anderer Einstellungen und Lebenskonzepte. Erfolg bedeutet, wenn man seine eigenen Komfortzonen zu verlassen wagt. Damit sind weniger die äußerlichen Komfortzonen, sondern vor allem die geistigen Komfortzonen gemeint: Jene Zonen, wo man spürt, dass es unbequem, unangenehm, sogar beängstigend werden könnte. Beispielsweise, dass man nicht mehr nur brav tut, was andere von einem erwarten, sondern wagt seinen Gefühlen mehr Raum zu geben und damit zusammenhängend auch Entscheidungen trifft, die unter Umständen für andere schwer zu verstehen sind. Komfortzone verlassen heißt, sowie ich es im Gespräch mit Florian verstanden habe, den Mut zu haben zuerst einmal auf Anerkennung im außen zu verzichten und sich selbst näherzukommen.

[...] Meine Ängste stecken dabei immer in mir - aber ich will mich nicht mehr von ihnen dominieren lassen (was nicht immer gelingt). [...]

Es geht dabei jedoch auch nicht um rücksichtsloses, übermütiges, egomanisches Handeln, sondern um die Balance, Grenzen zu überschreiten, ohne damit andere zu verletzen - das ist meinem Empfinden nach ein außerordentlicher Erfolg, aber auch ein außerordentlich hoher Anspruch an sich selbst!

Erfolg durch Selbstbewusstsein

Erfolgt heißt u.a., zur richtigen Zeit, am richtigen Ort, jene Menschen treffen, die die persönliche Entwicklung fördern. Florian hat sich in den letzten Jahren zum besseren Verstehen seines Lebenslaufes - und das seiner Auffassung nach im Wesentlichen ohne Wehmut, Trauer oder Frustration - intensiv mit den vielfältigen Abzweigungen in seinem Leben beschäftigt und daraus die Einsicht gewonnen, anders als früher diese Chancen besser zu nützen, anstatt sich aus Ängsten heraus „zu verkriechen"".

[...] Ich brauche Anstöße, das kann auch von einem Kritiker sein - und nachdem ich mich mit kreativer Arbeit sehr, sehr entblöße, habe ich damit erst umgehen lernen müssen. [...]

Jeder Mensch, eine Organisation, ein Unternehmen, der Status in der Gesellschaft, die Herkunft, die Familie kann einen Erfolg unterstützen, aber genauso gut einen möglichen Erfolg im Keim ersticken. Mit dieser Aussage mag ich, und Florian wird es ähnlich sehen, niemandem zu nahetreten. Wenn das passiert, dann nicht in böser Absicht, sondern aus sozialer Prägung heraus, aus Unwissenheit und Unreflektiertheit, Angst und auch Eifersucht. Ich weiß, Angst und noch viel mehr die Eifersucht sind heikle Themen. Aber ich denke, es gehört zum Erfolg dazu, und es hat Auswirkungen in den Biografien. Im Gespräch mit Florian hat mich ein Punkt, vielleicht weil es mich persönlich auch angeht, stark getroffen:

[...] Ich hatte keinen, der mich mit meinen künstlerischen Talenten so, wie ich es benötigt hätte, an der Hand genommen und mich an mich selbst herangeführt hätte. Ich selbst hatte damals nicht mein heutiges bzw oder auch , diese Dinge ohne Hilfe weiterentwickeln zu können. [...]

Mit der intensiven und auch schmerzhaften Reflexion über seine eigene Geschichte, u.a. auch die eigene Eitelkeit überwinden müssend, hat sich Florians Einstellung zum Erfolg verändert. Florian Böhm spricht heute von Erfolg, wenn er mit seinen Bildern, mit seinen Gedanken und Reflexionen Menschen berühren bzw. zum Nachdenken anregen kann - oder anders ausgedrückt, sich Menschen von seinen Bildern, Gedanken und Reflexionen berühren lassen.

[...] Erfolg ist, sich mit anderen Menschen in Schwingung bringen. [...]

Erfolg durch Leistungsvergleich

Bei genauerer Betrachtung wird Erfolg typischerweise im Vergleich mit anderen betrachtet. Der eine ist u.a. erfolgreich, weil er beispielsweise im Beruf die Karriereleiter hinaufgewandert ist, oder als Schauspieler einen Oskar gewonnen hat, oder ein weltberühmtes Bild gemalt hat, oder erfolgreich die Karriere hinter sich ließ um in den Alpen einen Bio-Bauernhof zu führen. Aus diesem Verständnis heraus zeigt sich Erfolg erst dann, wenn andere eine bestimmte Leistung honorieren, und besser bewerten als die eigenen. So gesehen entsteht Erfolg dadurch, dass andere einem folgen, weil diese meinen, dass das Tun eines Bestimmten besser ist als das von anderen. Erfolgt zeigt sich hier erst im Leistungsvergleich. Auch wenn Florian das nicht unbedingt unter Erfolg versteht, muss er sich diesem Aspekt von Erfolg auch stellen, zumindest habe ich es im Gespräch mit ihm so verstanden.

Erfolg durch Einsicht

Florian sieht jedoch im Erfolg, neben dem vorhin genannten, auch einen anderen, ganz wesentlichen Aspekt: Nämlich, einem „inneren Ruf"", einem inneren Gefühl, einer plötzlich hörbaren inneren Stimme zu folgen, ... Dann ist Erfolg nicht mehr nur an einen Leistungsgedanken gebunden, sondern der Weg des Herzens.

[...] Dinge zu tun, damit ich innerlich „zu:frieden"" bin. [...]

Und gerade dieser Weg kann nach außen hin alles andere als erfolgreich erscheinen, weder außergewöhnlich, noch spannend, noch überdurchschnittlich kreativ oder musikalisch oder sonst wie überdurchschnittlich gut. Erfolg ist dann vielmehr die Einsicht, das Leben so zu nehmen wie es ist, sich vielleicht sogar vom typischen Erfolgsstreben zu lösen, von dem Drang nach Anerkennung, von dem Drang, gesehen, gelobt, beklatscht, mit Geld überhäuft zu werden. Dann ist Erfolg die Einsicht, das Ego besser kennenzulernen, die Begierden, Wünsche, unerfüllten Sehnsüchte respektvoll zu behandeln, aber auch zu erkennen, dass man mit der Erfüllung aller Wünsche auch nicht das so erstrebte Glück, den persönlichen Erfolg erfahren wird. Erfolg ist so gesehen viel mehr der Weg der Selbsterkenntnis, der Zuwendung an die unfassbare Kraft und Energie des Lebens - und die bescheidene Einsicht, jeder Mensch ist etwas Besonderes und gleichzeitig nur ein Windhauch in der unendlichen Zeit im unendlichen Universum.

Erfolg durch Wahrnehmung der Grenzen

Die Erfolgs-Geschichten-Antreiber sind Gefühle, die befriedigt werden wollen - aktiv als Erfolgs-Geschichten-ProduzentInnen, wie bei Florian Böhm und passiv als Erfolgs-Geschichten-KonsumentInnen, unter die ich mich persönlich vorwiegend zählen würde. Sicherlich gibt es hie und da einen Rollenwechsel, doch meist bleibt man in seinem aktiven oder passiven Erfolgsstreben hängen, wechselt nicht die Seite. Das sieht man kaum, wirkt im Schleier der unbewussten Wirkungskräfte.

Ursprünglich bezeichnete der Begriff Erfolg lediglich die allgemeine Folge, Konsequenz oder Effekt eines Handelns. Mitunter wurde mit dem Begriff bloß das Erfolgen bzw. der (schicksalhafte) Verlauf eines Ereignisses beschrieben. Erst später, insbesondere mit der Industrialisierung, erhielt Erfolg die Bedeutung eines Resultats. Dieses Konzept ist die Basis für zahlreiche weitere Theorien des Erfolges, deren gemeinsamer Nenner es ist, Erfolg als die Fähigkeit zu interpretieren, seine selbst gesetzten Ziele zu erreichen. Zur Operationalisierung dient dabei das Konzept der Umsetzungskompetenz, mit dem man die Ausprägung der Fähigkeit messen kann, Absichten, Ziele und Kenntnisse in Ergebnisse umzuwandeln. So scheint es nicht verwunderlich, wenn Erfolg mit Leistung verkettet wird. Die Aussagen bzw. vielmehr die Bewertungen von Erfolg sind stark verbunden mit dem Wertesystem der Beurteilenden. Die Kultur, in der man lebt und arbeitet, prägt die Sichtweise von Erfolg.[1] So gesehen ist es für all jene schwieriger, die Erfolg in einer anderen Weise als der Mainstream wahrnehmen. Da stößt Erfolg an Grenzen.

Florian Böhm nimmt die Grenzen wahr, geht mit Begleitung der Angst und Zweifel weiter, trifft auf Menschen, lässt sich von Menschen berühren und berührt Menschen. Florian verkörpert für mich den stillen, unauffälligen Erfolg, das, was ich als Weg der Selbsterkenntnis bezeichnen würde.

Ein Richter aus Portugal findet Gewalt gegen Frauen nach einem Seitensprung des Opfers okay

Landesweit gab es Proteste

Selbst die Kirche mischte sich ein

Auch nach landesweiten Protesten verteidigt sich ein Richter, der bei einem Prozess Gewalt gegen Frauen im Fall eines Seitensprungs des Opfers gerechtfertigt hatte.

Der Richter hatte am 11. Oktober die Verurteilung des Ex-Ehemannes und des Liebhabers einer Frau annulliert, die das Opfer 2015 gemeinsam unter anderem mit einem Hammer angegriffen hatten. Die beiden Männer waren jeweils zu 15 und 12 Monaten Haft sowie zu Geldstrafen verurteilt worden und hatten Berufung eingelegt.

Der Ehebruch sei ""ein schlimmer Anschlag auf die Ehre und die Würde des Mannes"", hieß es in der Begründung des Richters Neto de Moura, der sich unter anderem auch auf die Bibel berief.

Der Oberste Justizrat Portugals leitete Ermittlungen gegen den Richter vom Landgericht von Porto ein. Man werde über das Thema beim nächsten Plenum des Justizrates am 7. November debattieren. Die Entscheidungen eines Richters seien aber unanfechtbar, hieß es in einer früheren Mitteilung.

""Im 21. Jahrhundert wollen wir keine Richter des 19. Jahrhunderts!""

Das Urteil löste im ganzen Land heftige Kritik und Empörung aus. Hunderte Menschen gingen am Freitagabend in Lissabon, in Porto - wo das umstrittene Urteil gefällt wurde - und anderen Städten des Landes auf die Straße, um gegen das Urteil zu protestieren.

In der Hauptstadt skandierten die Demonstranten unter anderem ""Machismo ist ein Verbrechen"". Sie trugen auch Plakate mit Aufschriften wie ""Im 21. Jahrhundert wollen wir keine Richter des 19. Jahrhunderts!""

Alors que l'organisation d'une rétrospective consacrée à Roman Polanski est vivement critiquée, notamment à travers une manifestation ce lundi 30 octobre, une nouvel événement organisé par l'institution culturelle parisienne fait déjà grincer des dents. Elle prévoit en effet d'honorer, en janvier, le travail du cinéaste Jean-Claude Brisseau, condamné pour harcèlement sexuel puis agression sexuelle.

Le réalisateur de 73 ans avait été condamné en 2005 à un an de prison avec sursis et 15.000 euros d'amende pour avoir harcelé sexuellement deux actrices lors des auditions pour son film ""Choses secrètes"". Il avait été condamné en appel en 2006 pour agression sexuelle sur une troisième actrice.

Le collectif Osez le féminisme a également réagi dans un communiqué, soulignant que ""la programmation (de l'hommage) inclut 'Les Anges exterminateurs', film d'auto-absolution du cinéaste, justifiant ses crimes sexistes par sa position d''artiste', et renvoyant la responsabilité sur les actrices, 'transgressives' et 'perverses'"".

Critiquée pour la tenue de la rétrospective Polanski, en pleine affaire Weinstein et au coeur de révélations en chaîne sur les agressions et le harcèlement sexuel quotidien, la Cinémathèque avait a refusé de plier, vantant son ""indépendance"".

Matteo Salvini è sul treno, quando apprende dalle agenzie che Silvio Berlusconi sarà a Catania, per la chiusura della campagna elettorale giovedì alle sei di pomeriggio, alle Ciminiere. Scuro in volto, si attacca al telefono: ""Ma come, noi chiudiamo alle sette e mezza al Teatro massimo e non sappiamo nulla?"".

Comizi separati, a distanza di un chilometro e mezzo, dieci minuti a piedi. Non è proprio la foto migliore, a tre giorni di una vittoria possibile, annunciata e vissuta come l'anticipazione di ciò che accadrà in Italia: ""È il solito Berlusconi, cambia idea, non dice nulla"". Il leader della Lega chiama Musumeci, ottiene la sua disponibilità a un comizio congiunto. Affida, giocando d'anticipo, la sua proposta alle agenzie: ""Se c'è una piazza comune è meglio"". Come a dire: io sono pronto, se non si fa andate a chiedere spiegazioni ad Arcore.

Ad Arcore la coincidenza temporale produce un certo fastidio, come la dichiarazione furbesca di Salvini. Troppo tardi per annullare, senza creare un caso. Ma, al momento, il programma non cambia: il Cavaliere sarà a Palermo il mercoledì e giovedì a Catania alle Ciminiere, punto. L'episodio dice tutto: l'assenza di contatti addirittura tra gli staff, che apprendono le notizie a mezzo stampa, e una malcelata insofferenza tra i leader. Anticipazione, appunto, di un centrodestra che politicamente non c'è come coalizione, né a Catania né a Palermo né a Roma, ma che con poca poesia sta assieme perché conviene numericamente.

In fondo sembra andare bene a tutti così, in questa lunga marcia di avvicinamento alle politiche che tanto assomiglia a una fiera dell'ipocrisia con schieramenti che esistono solo sulla carta. Secondo la legge elettorale appena approvata non c'è l'obbligo di scegliere il premier, né di presentare un straccio di programma comune; e i cosiddetti alleati delle coalizioni possono comportarsi come i famosi ladri di Pisa, che si azzuffano di giorno per poi spartirsi di notte il bottino dei ""nominati"". E l'Italia del centrodestra già assomiglia a una grande provincia di Catania. Basta mettere in fila le parole di oggi. Salvini contro gli ""impresentabili"" di Forza Italia, Salvini che occhieggia ai Cinque Stelle, nella speranza di sedurre l'elettorato grillino, Salvini che mai nomina Berlusconi, e già dice che se il centrodestra vince, bene, sennò non sarà mai disponibile a fare ""inciuci"". Il che significa, al netto della propaganda, che si tira fuori dall'ipotesi obbligata con questa legge elettorale che non produce maggioranza, ovvero un ""governo del presidente"" sostenuto in Parlamento da uno schieramento ampio.

E Berlusconi che invece, proprio oggi, in un'anticipazione del libro di Bruno Vespa, torna alla carica col nome di Antonio Tajani, tirandosi proprio dentro la dinamica del governo del presidente: ""Sarebbe un ottimo premier"". Tajani, che come noto è l'esponente di Forza Italia vissuto politicamente e umanamente da Salvini con più fastidio, proprio oggi ha reso omaggio ad Hammamet alla tomba di Bettino Craxi. Quando Salvini aveva i pantaloni corti Bossi lo chiamava ""Alì Bobò con i quaranta ladroni"", ""per metà un uomo di Stato e per metà un farabutto"", evocando addirittura l'immagine della ghigliottina.

Ecco la fotografia del centrodestra, in un contesto storico e politico in cui l'uno, il giovane leader della Lega sente di essere proiettato verso il futuro e l'altro, il vecchio leader di Forza Italia, è all'ultimo giro politico per tornare al governo. Dice un big della Lega: ""Il vero giro di Salvini non è questo, il 2018, ma il prossimo. Sa bene che non ci sarà maggioranza e si metterà all'opposizione dell'inciucio, convinto che la prossima legislatura durerà poco. E che chi governa piangerà lacrime amare per trovare i soldi della manovra di primavera. Dunque si preserva e ingrossa le file"".

Non sono chiacchiere di scenario, ma calcoli e strategie che hanno già determinato una dinamica, appunto i comizi separati e la coalizione dei separati. A marzo si vota per le politiche, poi si vota in Friuli, il prossimo anno in Piemonte, nel 2020 in Veneto e Liguria. Prosegue la fonte: ""I governatori, i maggiorenti anche di Forza Italia stanno tutti inguattati. E sono coloro che metteranno i parlamentari nei collegi. Non si sganceranno dal centrodestra. E Salvini aspetta solo che Berlusconi vada con Renzi per papparsi Forza Italia al Nord"". E a fine giornata tra i due nessuno contatto. Nemmeno tra gli staff per la chiusura a Catania.","Vento in poppa, timonieri separati",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/10/30/vento-in-poppa-timonieri-separati_a_23261038/?utm_hp_ref=it-homepage

Effective listening could be the answer, but mastering the art of effective listening isn't as straightforward as it seems.
What Is Effective Listening?
With this in mind, effective listening is giving your full attention, not only to what another person is saying, but also to their body language.
Reading body language is an important part of effective listening.","Being understood and accepted is a fundamental element of the human condition and one of the most meaningful ways to feel this is by being listened to.

While it might sound simple, properly listening to someone is a real art. What's even harder than giving someone your full attention, is not putting yourself into their situation through unwanted advice.

So, how do we provide support for the people in our lives and ensure they are feeling understood and accepted? Effective listening could be the answer, but mastering the art of effective listening isn't as straightforward as it seems.

What Is Effective Listening?

Professor Frances Quirk from Barwon Health says listening to another person is one of the best ways to show positive regard for those you work, interact or live with.

""The greatest gift you can give anyone is actually being able to satisfy your own judgement, bias, agenda and fully, wholey listen to another person,"" Quirk told HuffPost Australia.

One of the reasons that we need someone who is in our lives that is an effective listener is that we don't pay much attention to what we say to ourselves.

With this in mind, effective listening is giving your full attention, not only to what another person is saying, but also to their body language. It's vital to engage not only your ears, but all of your other senses as well, so you are able to build a comprehensive picture of what the other person is saying.

""It's really mindful listening,"" Quirk said. ""You are focusing fully on the other person, on what they are saying and you are not just engaging your hearing sense -- you are fully engaging all of your senses so you're looking at some of their behaviours because sometimes they are not congruent. So, they might say something sad but laugh or say something challenging but dismiss it.

""So, part of effectively listening is actually interpreting all the other things that they are communicating to you non-verbally as well as verbally.""

Reading body language is an important part of effective listening.

Quirk says that we should aim to be a mirror for the person we are listening to, so they are able to see themselves and their situation more clearly.

""You are trying to get the person to the real meaning of what they are saying, to help them understand themselves better by being a bit of a mirror. So, you are giving back to them what they are giving to you and you know you have got it right when people start saying, 'Exactly, that's what I mean.'""

How Can You Be An Effective Listener?

Effective listening is all about making the other person feel comfortable and valued and a major part of this is being genuinely interested in what that person is trying to say.

""Being someone who can convey warmth and positive regard [is important] so that you are conveying to a person that you are genuinely interested in what they have to say and that is not coming from a perspective of personal gain or boosting your own ego,"" Quirk said.

All people really want is for someone to fully engage with them and be able to communicate back that they really have understood their perspective.

Warmth and genuinity should be combined with a non-judgemental ear, so the person can understand themselves better.

""You are non-judgemental -- you make no comments about what it is they are saying, you don't express any opinion one way or another. The only communication from you to the other person as an effective listener is to essentially repeat back what they are saying.""

""It is actually to directly give their words directly back or to give your version of their words directly back as a way of checking what you have understood what they are actually saying -- it's a skill and it's hard to exercise in a mindful way.""

Effective listening lets us see ourselves more clearly.

What Are The Barriers To Effective Listening?

Being an effective listener is a difficult task to master. While there are a number of factors that feed into someone's ability to listen properly, one key element to remember is avoiding giving any form of advice unless the other person directly asks you.

""If you say anything beyond, 'I am trying to understand what it is you are telling me' and 'Is this what you are saying?', you have moved out of the scope of effective listening already,"" Quirk explained.

Essentially, if you find yourself saying things like, 'Have you tried ...', 'I did this and it worked' or 'I know someone who did this in the past and...' then you have moved well out of the effective listening space.

Giving unwanted advice can leave a person feeling lonely and isolated.

Why Do We Need To Be Listened To?

Being listened to is one way each of us feels accepted by those around us. Quirk says that having someone reflect exactly what we are feeling back to ourselves gives us the tools to grow in our own self-knowledge and understanding.

""It seems so feeble, if all you are doing is listening to someone and giving them back what they are saying -- 'how is that going to work?' But actually, it does because all people really want is for someone to fully engage with them and be able to communicate back that they really have understood their perspective and that's it,"" Quirk said.

""One of the reasons that we need someone who is in our lives that is an effective listener is that we don't pay much attention to what we say to ourselves. You have all these ideas but you don't listen to yourself. You provide your own answers you need someone to reflect back to us.""",How To Give Good Advice (By Giving No Advice At All),http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/24/how-to-give-good-advice-by-giving-no-advice-at-all_a_23248200/

Die aber gibt sich unbeeindruckt - und ruft ihre parteiinternen Kritiker auf den Plan

Von Rücktritt ist die Rede - und einem Neuanfang mit einem neuen Kanzlerkandidaten

Es ist der Tag nach der Niedersachsen-Pleite. Doch Kanzlerin Merkel wirkt, als kommentiere sie das fröhliche Herbstwetter.

Ihre Partei sei durch die Wahl nicht geschwächt, sie gehe ""selbstbewusst in die Sondierungsgespräche zu Jamaika"", erklärt sie am Montag im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus.

Viele andere in der Partei starren nur auf die schlechten Ergebnisse in Niedersachsen und bei der Bundestagswahl zwei Wochen zuvor. Sie sprechen von einem Ende der Ära Merkel - und laden ihren Frust ab.

Wie etwa bei der Bundestagsabgeordneten Sylvia Pantel.

Unter der Oberfläche brodelt es

Ihr Telefon stand am Morgen nicht mehr still. Bei ihr meldeten sich aufgebrachte Parteifreunde, denen die Geduld ausgeht. ""Sie fürchten, dass wir noch weitere Stimmen an die AfD verlieren und sorgen sich um das Profil unserer Partei"", sagt sie im HuffPost-Gespräch. ""Ich kann das nachvollziehen"".

Pantel erwartet von ihrer Partei nun Veränderungen. Und die müssen ganz oben anfangen. Es brauche einen Merkel-Nachfolger.

""Die CDU muss einen Kandidaten aufbauen"", fordert sie. ""Nichte heute, nicht morgen, aber in der Mitte der Legislatur brauchen wir hier Klarheit."" Vor vier Jahren habe man die Nachfolgeregelung versäumt. Jetzt sei es höchste Zeit. ""Ich bin überzeugt davon, dass ein Großteil der CDU-Wähler kein ""Weiter so"" will.""

""Ein Kandidat, der Merkel ablösen soll""

Pantel ist klar, dass sie damit ein Tabu in der Politik bricht.

In der Öffentlichkeit wird nicht über die Zeit nach dem Amtsinhaber spekuliert. Pantel macht das trotzdem - und hofft, dass möglichst viele in der CDU mitmachen. ""Häufig ist es doch so: Wer sich zuerst mit einer guten Idee herauswagt, wird öffentlich an den Pranger gestellt. Zwei Jahre später wollen es dann alle gesagt haben.""

Ganz alleine ist sie in der CDU mit ihrer Forderung aber nicht.

""Unreflektiertes Weiterso""

Die Werteunion, ein Zusammenschluss konservativer Kreise der Partei, fordert gar Merkels Rücktritt. Der Zusammenschluss verschickte eilig nach den ersten Hochrechnung einen ""Fahrplan zur Übergabe der Kanzlerschaft"".

Merkel müsse als Parteivorsitzende zurücktreten, heißt es darin. Die Wähler in Niedersachsen hätten ein ""unreflektiertes Weiterso der Kanzlerin nach der desaströsen Bundestagswahl abgestraft"".

Solche Maximalforderungen liegen auf der Empörungsskala freilich ganz weit oben und sind sicher nicht merheitsfähig in der CDU. Auch wollen einflussreiche CDU-Politiker davon nichts wissen. Die Frage stelle sich nicht, sagen sie - oder drücken sich moderater aus.

""Unangreifbarkeit von Merkel ist nicht mehr aufrechtzuerhalten""

Der CDU-Wirtschaftsrat etwa gab der Kanzlerin am Sonntag eine Mitschuld an dem niedersächsischen Ergebnis.

""Der Schlüssel für die Niederlage in Hannover liegt leider im Berliner Wahlabend am 24. September, als man die verheerenden Verluste von über acht Prozent zu einem strategischen Sieg schöngeredet hat"", sagt der Generalsekretär Wolfgang Steiger der ""Bild"".

Und CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer sprach von einem ""Alarmsignal für die gesamte Union"".

Angesichts solcher Äußerungen beschreiben Beobachter Merkel mindestens als angeschlagen.

""Die Position von Merkel ist in ihrer Unangreifbarkeit nicht mehr aufrechtzuerhalten"", sagt etwa der Politik-Experte Wolfgang Oberreuter im Gespräch mit der HuffPost.

""Merkels Beruhigungspillen werden einige in der Partei nicht mehr anstandslos schlucken"", sagt er. Und in dem Augenblick, in dem über ihre Nachfolge offen diskutiert werde, sei ihre Führungskraft geschwächt.

""Massive inhaltliche Auseinandersetzungen""

Noch deutlicher drückt sich der Berliner Politologe Albrecht von Lucke aus. ""Merkels Ende ist eingeleitet"", sagte er dem Nachrichtensender N24. Es gehe vor allem um eine ""massive inhaltliche Auseinandersetzung"" in der Partei - eine Art Stellvertreterkrieg der Merkel-Anhänger und -Gegner.

""Eine Fraktion macht sich stark, die die Union nach rechts ziehen will"". Dass das sogar die Sondierungsgespräche mit den Jamaika-Parteien treffen könnte, gab sogar Merkel indirekt zu.

Die Gefahr ist groß, dass sich die Verhandlungsparteien mit ihren Forderungen und roten Linien überwerfen, allen voran die angeschlagene Union. Die Gespräche werden deswegen einige Wochen dauern, sagte die Kanzlerin.

Wenigstens das klang nicht so, als ginge es gerade ums Wetter.

Former Manafort business associate Rick Gates also has been told to turn himself in to federal authorities, multiple news outlets reported on Monday.

Manafort left his Virginia condo and, with his attorney, walked into the FBI field office in Washington early Monday.

Manafort and Gates are expected to be charged in an intensifying investigation into Russian meddling in the United States' 2016 presidential election.

The office of special counsel Robert Mueller, which is conducting the probe, is expected to serve the indictment on Monday. The apparent forthcoming arrests come three days after news broke that a federal grand jury in Washington had filed the first charges stemming from Mueller's investigation.

Reportshave suggested federal investigators could use the threat of criminal charges as way to pressure Manafort into providing more information about alleged collusion between Trump's campaign and the Kremlin.

Trump, who does not have the power to pardon state crimes, has aggressively denied allegations that his team colluded with Russia to win the election.

A former prosecutor and FBI director, Mueller partnered with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in August to look into Manafort's possible financial crimes, including money laundering.

CNWL and GPs have seen more than 1,300 people either for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) screening or Grenfell-related physical health concerns since flames engulfed the 24-storey tower.

PA Wire/PA Images The Grenfell Tower fire has led to the biggest mental health response that’s ever been seen in Europe.

Medical health professionals warned in the immediate aftermath of the fire that traumatised people affected by the blaze were being forgotten, which could lead to an increased risk of PTSD. Health professionals in London estimate that about 11,000 people in the wider area around the Lancaster West Estate could experience difficulties of some description, although not all will necessarily seek treatment, while the fire may also have been triggering for others across the country. Dr Green, clinical director at the Grenfell Tower NHS Mental Health Response, said: “I think this is the biggest programme there’s ever been in Europe, certainly in terms of mental health. There’s never been anything like it. “It does strike us that this is a much bigger push than there’s ever been anywhere else … so it is very novel, there are a lot of things that we’re doing that people have never done before.”

About 200 of the trust’s staff have been earmarked to door-knock people who may be struggling in the wake of the fire, which killed at least 80 people. The trust has made almost 4,000 approaches in the north Kensington community, where GPs have logged more than a thousand Grenfell-related appointments. Some 360 adults and children, including survivors and bereaved families, are currently undergoing PTSD treatment, which has been completed by 28 adults and three children. There are also 60 people undergoing treatment for a variety of mental health issues who are not from the direct Grenfell area and have been remotely affected by the tragedy. It raises the possibility that there could be hundreds more people across the UK similarly affected after watching the burning building on television from afar. Dr Green said it could be years before the true mental health toll was revealed, with one person involved in the July 7 2005 bombings only recently seeking help, and some of those affected by the Ladbroke Grove rail crash in 1999 coming forward 10 years later. Part of the difficulty is that PTSD can be unpredictable, with trauma able to “spontaneously recede” or make an unexpected return. So far, 755 adults and children have been screened, with 667 adults in urgent need for treatment who are being fast-tracked so they can start immediately if practical. An extra 70 staff drafted in has prevented delays for patients already awaiting treatment for unrelated mental health issues before the disaster struck. Separately, 715 patients have visited GPs with “Grenfell-related issues” around well-being and physical complaints such as breathing difficulties or existing conditions made worse by the fire. They were screened for PTSD and more than 160 referred on for specialist treatment. Looking forward, Dr Green said that there was the potential for mental health teams to learn from their approach. He said that, while clearly very different scenarios, the pro-active outreach seen after the fire could also be effective if deployed after serious floodings, where trauma support is lacking despite the huge upheaval victims experience.

Charles Taylor et Jocelyn Maclure sont des philosophes catholiques qui militent pour protéger toutes les religions. Leur récente prise de position publique sur le Projet de Loi 62 nous propose un raisonnement contradictoire. En lisant leurs nombreux textes, j'ai l'impression de me retrouver au centre du roman Soumission de Michel Houellebecq.

La philosophie vise l'universel, le général, les concepts, les lois en général et ne s'occupe pas du particulier, du singulier, des affects, de l'application concrète des lois. Nos deux philosophes semblent oublier cet aspect fondamental de leur discipline. Les philosophes ne doivent-ils pas se concentrer d'abord et avant tout sur la recherche des concepts universels, comme l'affirmait Hegel ?

D'une part, ils affirment la prépondérance des principes universels, la ''liberté de religion et le droit à la non-discrimination des femmes'' et d'autre part, ils laissent les individus appliquer ces principes, localement au cas par cas : «Les employés et gestionnaires qui œuvrent dans ces organismes sont les mieux placés» pour juger concrètement de l'application de la Loi. Avouons que les mobiles et les motifs qui poussent nos philosophes à faire de telles affirmations sont obscurs.

Le fait que Charles Taylor reçoive des prix accompagnés de milliers de dollars démontre bien que les religions, qu'il essaie de sauver, perdent du terrain.

Cela démontre que, face à la montée des Lumières, de la raison et de la laïcité, nos penseurs religieux sont aux abois. Les religions sont des institutions humaines qui offrent aux peuples des mythes, des légendes et des récits fabuleux. Le fait que Charles Taylor reçoive des prix accompagnés de milliers de dollars démontre bien que les religions, qu'il essaie de sauver, perdent du terrain.

Dans un livre récent Les avenues de la foi, Charles Taylor affirme que le rationalisme de la science est «sclérosant» et que l'être humain doit s'appuyer sur des «intuitions indémontrables», parce que le monde n'est pas réductible à des «lois causales.» Ces intuitions, on l'aura deviné, sont de nature religieuse et improuvable.

Charles Taylor a gagné le prix de la Fondation Templeton comme de nombreux prêtres, pasteurs, évangélistes, évêques qui se nomment Desmond Tutu, le Dalaï-Lama, mère Theresa, le frère Roger, Jean Vanier, etc. tous des gens très religieux. Ce prix de 1.5$ million est donné à des militants qui défendent les valeurs religieuses. Cette fondation soutien des partisans du «dessein intelligent».Charles Taylor est le seul philosophe à avoir reçu ce prix qui donne une bourse plus importante qu'un Prix Nobel.

Daniel Weinstock, professeur de philosophie à l'UdeM et à McGill, et l'un des commissaires de la Commission sur les accommodements raisonnables, présente dans un livre, les idées de son ancien professeur. Il critique sa conception de la religion :

«Dans l'avant dernier paragraphe du livre, Les sources du moi, Taylor fait valoir ses convictions spirituelles personnelles, qui lui font placer son espoir dans le théisme judéo chrétien et dans sa promesse centrale d'une affirmation divine de l'humain, plus totale que celle à laquelle les êtres humains pourraient jamais atteindre par eux-mêmes.»

Fait extrêmement surprenant dans le petit monde des intellectuels québécois, dans son article Daniel Weinstock ose parler des préjugés de Charles Taylor présentés dans ce même livre.

«Des préjugés ont également été soulevés par des historiens inquiets par ce qu'ils voient comme étant la tentation manifestée par ''Source du moi'' de faire dans ''l'histoire à thèse''. Par exemple, pour Jerrold Seigel, qui a consacré tout un ouvrage, The ''Idea of the Self'', à la formulation d'une histoire de sujet occidental s'inscrivant en faux par rapport à celle de Taylor, l'entreprise de ce dernier est viciée à l'avance par le fait qu'il choisit les auteurs qu'il voit comme étant fondamentaux pour notre tradition, ainsi que les arguments à mettre en évidence chez tel ou tel ou tel philosophes, en fonction de sa thèse philosophique qu'il veut mettre de l'avant. Cela donne lieu à mon avis à une vision fortement biaisée de l'histoire du sujet.» Bref, Charles Taylor sélectionne ses références historiques pour justifier a posteriori sa thèse de départ pour protéger les religions.

Les figures d'autorité doivent aider les jeunes à se faire une opinion en se basant sur le respect des institutions démocratiques. Monsieur Bouchard nie cette réalité.

Son collègue et coprésident de la commission éponyme, Gérard Bouchard n'est pas en reste. Dans un texte, Perdre le gout du Québec, il affirme aussi de grands principes universels : «Nous vivons dans une société démocratique où règnent une grande liberté et un attachement profond aux idéaux de justice sociale et d'égalité.» Une telle prise de position devrait annoncer une invitation aux jeunes à adhérer à ces idéaux. Mais au lieu de pousser les jeunes à qui il parlait, à respecter les lois, il rejette la loi 62, votée démocratiquement par les élus de l'Assemblée nationale. Selon lui, cette loi est «mal ficelée, les motifs sont douteux, est un fatras de contradictions et d'inepties assorties de dispositions byzantines, que les villes refusent d'appliquer.» Imaginez ce que peut comprendre un jeune issu d'une société ou la démocratie n'existe pas ou est malmenée ? Une loi peut être contestée, mais ne peut être rejetée comme le fait le maire Coderre. Les figures d'autorité doivent aider les jeunes à se faire une opinion en se basant sur le respect des institutions démocratiques. Monsieur Bouchard nie cette réalité.

Nos trois professeurs me rappellent le héros du romanSoumission, de Michel Houellebecq. Le personnage principal fait partie de l'élite intellectuelle des professeurs d'université. Il participe au processus de collaboration avec un islam adapté à la France, qui veut promouvoir la religion. L'auteur décrit une université française imaginaire, corrompue par l'argent saoudien. Il a imaginé avec humour une pratique raisonnable de l'islamisation, modifiant toutes les coutumes, les lois, la vie des femmes et les cours donnés aux étudiantes. Les Saoudiens utilisent leurs milliards de pétrodollars pour subventionner les universités qui payent grassement des professeurs ordinaires qui acceptent l'autorité académique d'un recteur musulman. Ces professeurs ont même le bonheur de pouvoir se marier avec une ou deux jeunes étudiantes islamistes. Nos intellectuels québécois devraient connaitre le philosophe athée Michel Onfray, qui affirmait récemment : « Michel Houellebecq a diagnostiqué l'effondrement spirituel de notre époque.''

Il me semble que monsieur Charles Taylor ferait œuvre plus utile en conseillant à ses amies pour couvrir leur figure, de porter un masque à l'Halloween, pendant le Carnaval du Mardi gras, les fêtes d'enfants, les parties pour adultes, etc., mais pas l'été par 35 degrés Celsius, en attendant le bus! Il pourrait se servir de sa notoriété internationale pour promouvoir la tolérance. De son côté, Gérard Bouchard devrait recommander de respecter les lois votées par nos députés élus démocratiquement.","Sur le projet de loi 62, Charles Taylor, Jocelyn Maclure et Gérard Bouchard se contredisent",http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/loyola-leroux/sur-le-projet-de-loi-62-charles-taylor-jocelyn-maclure-et-gerard-bouchard-se-contredisent_a_23261060/

La région est plus que jamais divisée, deux jours après sa déclaration d'indépendance marquant une rupture sans précédent en 40 ans de démocratie.

""La Catalogne, c'est nous tous!"": c'est sur ce même slogan que les organisateurs de ce nouveau rassemblement avaient déjà réussi à mobiliser plusieurs centaines de milliers de personnes contre la sécession, le 8 octobre.

L'appel de l'association organisatrice, la Société civile catalane, est assorti de deux mots: ""coexistence"" et surtout ""seny"", ce ""bon sens"" supposé réunir une majorité des Catalans face à ce que les détracteurs des indépendantistes qualifient de fuite en avant ou de ""déraison"". Leur but est clair: démontrer que la réalité de ce territoire grand comme la Belgique reste très nuancée.

La manifestation s'est produite alors que Madrid cherche au plus vite à reprendre en main la Catalogne, dont la déclaration d'indépendance n'a obtenu aucune reconnaissance internationale et où les drapeaux de l'Espagne restent visibles sur les bâtiments de l'État.

Officiellement, la région est désormais dirigée directement par la numéro 2 du gouvernement, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, tout le gouvernement catalan et jusqu'à 150 hauts responsables de l'administration -selon la presse- ayant été destitués.

15h49: ""Pas de République catalane""

""Ils ne nous trompent pas: la Catalogne, c'est l'Espagne"", ont crié les centaines de milliers de Catalans dans les rues de Barcelone, 48 heures après la proclamation de la ""République catalane"" venue renforcer leur ""colère"". Des pancartes clament ""Ensemble"", ""Non au coup d'Etat"" ou ""Catalogne ma terre, Espagne mon pays"".

La foule, d'une moyenne d'âge plus élevée que dans les rassemblements indépendantistes, s'est massée dès la fin de matinée sur le Passeig de Gracia - une des avenues barcelonaises les plus chics - encadrée par un important dispositif policier. Chaque hélicoptère de la police nationale qui survole le rassemblement est acclamé, alors qu'il était hué lors des manifestations pro-indépendance.

14h43: 1 million de manifestants à Barcelone selon les autorités espagnoles

1 million de personnes ont manifesté dimanche à Barcelone en faveur de l'unité de l'Espagne, selon l'estimation livrée par la préfecture, représentant l'Etat en Catalogne.

La police municipale a pour sa part estimé que 300.000 personnes avaient participé au défilé où flottaient des milliers de drapeaux de l'Espagne et de la Catalogne. Les organisateurs avançaient pour leur part, à la fin de la manifestation, le chiffre de 1,3 million.

14h28: La Belgique pourrait offrir l'asile à Puigdemont, selon un ministre séparatiste

La Belgique pourrait offrir l'asile au dirigeant séparatiste catalan Carles Puigdemont, a laissé entendre le secrétaire d'Etat belge à l'Asile et à la Migration Theo Francken, membre du parti indépendantiste flamand de la Nouvelle alliance flamande (N-VA), suscitant la colère du parti conservateur au pouvoir en Espagne.

Après sa destitution, Carles Puigdemont risque des poursuites pour ""désobéissance"" et ""malversation de fonds"" pour avoir convoqué le référendum interdit du 1er octobre sur l'indépendance, voire des poursuites pour ""rébellion"" qui peuvent lui valoir en cas de condamnation jusqu'à 30 ans de prison.

Theo Francken s'est demandé si ce dernier pouvait être assuré d'un procès équitable, affirmant que le dirigeant séparatiste catalan pouvait se voir octroyer l'asile en Belgique s'il le demandait.

Ces déclarations ont été jugées ""inacceptables"" par le porte-parole du Parti populaire (conservateur) au pouvoir en Espagne, le député européen Esteban Gonzalez Pons. Il s'agit de ""graves accusations contre le système judiciaire espagnol"" et en espérant qu'une ""correction y sera apportée immédiatement"", a-t-il déclaré, selon un communiqué de son parti. Theo Francken ""a violé les principes de solidarité et collaboration loyale entre les pays membres de l'UE"", dénonce aussi ce communiqué.

13h55: Les Mossos ont reçu l'ordre de retirer les photos du gouvernement destitué de leurs locaux

C'est une note interne qui circule auprès des Mossos, la police catalane. Selon le quotidien El Pais, les forces régionales ont reçu l'ordre de retirer toutes les photographies du gouvernement destitué de leurs commissariat. Plus globalement, ce sont tous les bâtiments officiels qui sont concernés.

A l'heure actuelle, El Pais n'est pas en mesure de dire si celles-ci ont été retirées. Les Mossos d'Esquadra se retrouvent au coeur du bras de fer entre le gouvernement espagnol et l'exécutif de Catalogne.

Depuis, leur reprise en main est en tête des priorités du gouvernement conservateur de Mariano Rajoy.

Madrid a d'abord remplacé leur chef opérationnel, Josep Lluis Trapero, soupçonné d'être trop proche des dirigeants indépendantistes et qui fait, en outre, l'objet d'une enquête pour sédition.

Désormais les quelque 16.000 agents sont dans l'attente. Devront-ils obéir aux ordres de Madrid ou à ceux d'un hypothétique gouvernement de la ""République catalane"", qu'aucun pays n'a reconnue?

13h25: Entre 300.000 et 1 million de personnes manifestent

Selon la police municipale, 300.000 Espagnols manifestent pour l'unité du pays. Il s'agit du même chiffre que lors de la manifestation pro-indépendance du 3 octobre dernier, organisée quelques semaines avant la déclaration d'indépendance de la Catalogne et deux jours après le vote lors du référendum.

La Société civile catalane, qui organise cette manifestation, sous le slogan la Catalogne c'est nous tous, a elle estimé la participation à 1,1 million de personnes, comme vous pouvez le voir dans la vidéo ci-dessous.

12h00: Des milliers de Catalans dans les rues de Barcelone

Des milliers de Catalans décidés à rester en Espagne manifestent dans les rues de Barcelone ce dimanche. Ce rassemblement intervient alors que la Catalogne s'interroge sur l'avenir de Carles Puigdemont, le président indépendantiste de la région destitué par Madrid.

Aux cris de ""Puigdemont en prison"", de nombreux Espagnols anti-sécession se dirigent vers l'une des avenues les plus connues de la capitale catalane, le Passeig de Gracia, pour ce rassemblement entouré d'un important dispositif policier.

Selon notre journaliste Jade Toussay sur place, un important dispositif policier a été déployé. Devant le bureau de la délégation nationale du gouvernement espagnol, les manifestants remercient les forces de l'ordre.

10h24: 46% des Catalans veulent rester espagnols, contre 42% en juin

Le quotidien espagnol El Pais a publié ce samedi un sondage dans lequel 29% des Catalans affirment être favorables à l'indépendance de la région. 46% d'entre eux souhaitent rester espagnols, tandis qu'ils étaient 42% en juin dernier, relate Le Parisien.

9h38: ""Puigdemont est et restera le président"" de la Catalogne

Le chef de file des indépendantistes Carles ""Puidgemont est et restera le président"" de la Catalogne, a affirmé Oriol Junqueras, le vice-président du gouvernement catalan destitué par Madrid, dans une tribune publiée ce dimanche.

""Carles Puigdemont est et restera le président du pays, et Carme Forcadell est et resta la présidente du parlement, et ce au moins jusqu'au jour où les citoyens décideront du contraire lors d'élections libres"", écrit-il dans le quotidien El Punt-Avui, dénonçant un ""coup d'Etat contre la Catalogne"".

""Nous ne pouvons reconnaître (...) aucune des mesures anti-démocratiques que le Parti populaire (le parti de Mariano Rajoy) met en place depuis Madrid"", poursuit Oriol Junqueras. Fait marquant, il signe cette tribune en tant que ""vice-président du gouvernement de Catalogne"", titre qu'il portait avant la mise sous tutelle de la Catalogne enclenchée par Madrid.

9h35: Des Comités de défense de la République de Catalogne appellent à la ""résistance pacifique""

Malgré une mobilisation ce dimanche, les séparatistes catalans ne s'avouent pas vaincus. Samedi, leur chef de file Carles Puigdemont, destitué de son poste de président catalan par Madrid, a, dans une allocution télévisée, appelé les siens à s'opposer pacifiquement à la mise sous tutelle de l'Etat. Le dirigeant séparatiste n'a pas précisé de quelle manière cette opposition doit se manifester. Mais depuis plusieurs jours, des Comités de défense de la République issus des quartiers appellent à la ""résistance pacifique"".

Le quotidien El Pais rapportait aussi ce samedi qu'un gouvernement parallèle, issu de l'Association des municipalités pour l'indépendance, pourrait être mis en place.

Algunas protectoras de animales no permiten la adopción de gatos negros en otoño por miedo a que los sacrifiquen en Halloween.
Hay estudios que demuestran que Halloween hace que los niños se comporten peor.
Un estudio en particular recoge que los niños disfrazados sin supervisión que se reúnen en grupo tienen más probabilidades de robar caramelos y dinero que los niños que no van ni disfrazados ni en grupo.
Otra investigación revela que los niños que llevan máscaras tienen muchas más probabilidades de tomarse más caramelos de los que deberían si creen que no hay ningún adulto supervisándolos.","Halloween es un día para tomar caramelos, para disfrazarse y para ver películas de miedo, pero, ¿cómo se ha convertido en lo que es ahora? ¿Por qué los niños recorren sus barrios diciendo ""¿truco o trato?"" Las calabazas talladas son un concepto un poco curioso y, desde siempre, hemos desconfiado de los desconocidos que dan caramelos.

Dicho esto, podemos pensar que Halloween es una fiesta un tanto extraña: ¿En qué otra ocasión podríamos disfrazarnos de Olaf sexy o de dron espeluznante? De todas formas, un muñeco de nieve sexy es difícil de comparar con los verdaderos orígenes de Halloween. Lo más probable es que no tengas ni idea de lo rara que es esta fiesta, así que hemos recopilado ocho datos para ti:

1. Había que bailar para conseguir los dulces.

La mayoría de los expertos consideran que el origen del truco o trato está en una antigua costumbre europea de disfrazarse o ponerse máscaras para llamar a las puertas de los hogares y bailar, cantar o actuar a cambio de algo. Pero, según afirma Elizabeth Pleck en su libro Celebrating the family [Homenajeando a la familia], ""la tradición surgió en Estados Unidos, donde comenzó a realizarse en Acción de Gracias"". Al principio, los hombres iban de puerta en puerta y los niños iban detrás pidiendo monedas. La mayoría eran pobres y necesitaban dinero, pero, poco después, los niños ricos empezaron a hacer el ""truco o trato"". Se dejó de ir pidiendo de puerta en puerta en 1930, pero esta práctica volvió con fuerza a finales del siglo XX para que los niños dejaran de hacer bromas de Halloween.

2. Halloween es más irlandés que el día de San Patricio.

Los orígenes de Halloween se remontan al Samhain, un festival celta en honor a los difuntos. Los celtas creían que los fantasmas vagaban por la Tierra durante esta festividad, así que la gente se disfrazaba y dejaba dulces en la puerta de su casa para apaciguarlos.

Es cierto que los celtas no sólo vivían en Irlanda cuando estas costumbres comenzaron a tomar forma en torno al siglo I a. C., pero, como mencionamos más adelante, fueron los celtas irlandeses los que inventaron las calabazas de Halloween.

Los misioneros cristianos —entre los cuales se encontraba San Patricio, que, por cierto, no era irlandés— cambiaron y adaptaron este ""prototipo"" de Halloween y eso dio lugar a unas celebraciones más similares a las actuales. El legado de los misioneros fue reconocido principalmente por los estadounidenses.

""El día de San Patricio lo inventaron en Estados Unidos los estadounidenses con orígenes irlandeses"", explica Philip Freeman, profesor del Luther College de Iowa (Estados Unidos). Según National Geographic, la fiesta era una ""festividad religiosa menor"" en Irlanda hasta la década de los setenta, así que no es una fiesta tan irlandesa como parece. Además, probablemente ni siquiera fuera irlandés: su color característico era el azul, no el verde, y el mito de hacer desaparecer serpientes es en realidad una metáfora de su triunfo sobre el paganismo irlandés: el mismo tipo de paganismo que inventó la fiesta de Halloween.

3. En las primeras celebraciones de Halloween, la gente se disfrazaba con pieles y cabezas de animal.

4. Antes se tallaban nabos, remolachas y patatas en vez de calabazas.

Según antiguos registros de la época romana, las tribus asentadas en lo que hoy en día es Alemania y Francia se ponían cabezas y pieles de animales para conectar con los espíritus de los difuntos. Esta tradición siguió hasta el Samhain, la festividad celta que inspiró al Halloween estadounidense. En esa época, las personas se pintaban la cara de negro para disfrazarse de espíritus malignos. El líder de los desfiles de Samhain se vestía con una sábana blanca y llevaba una cabeza de caballo de madera o un cráneo de caballo decorado . Los jóvenes también celebraban el Samhain travistiéndose.

El origen de las conocidas linternas de calabaza (jack-o'lantern en inglés), típicas de Halloween, está en una vieja historia irlandesa sobre un hombre llamado Stingy Jack [Jack el tacaño]. Según la historia, Jack había ido a emborracharse con el diablo e intentó convencerle de que se convirtiera en una moneda para pagar las bebidas sin gastar dinero. Tras conseguirlo, Jack se guardó al diablo, ya en forma de moneda, en el bolsillo junto a una cruz de plata que impedía que el diablo se transformase. Prometió liberarle siempre y cuando no le molestara durante un año y, si moría, el diablo no podía llevarse su alma. Jack volvió a engañar al diablo, hizo que cogiera una fruta de un árbol y, mientras estaba subido en una rama, Jack talló el símbolo de la cruz en el árbol y así consiguió disfrutar de 10 años más de vida sin el diablo.

Cuando Jack murió, Dios decidió que no podía ir al cielo, pero el diablo había prometido no llevarle al infierno. Por eso, tuvo que vagar por la Tierra con un carbón encendido que le servía para alumbrar. Jack puso el carbón dentro de un nabo a modo de farol y Stingy Jack se convirtió en Jack of the Lantern (Jack el del farol) o Jack o' Lantern. Basándose en esta historia, los irlandeses empezaron a tallar caras espeluznantes en nabos, remolachas y patatas para ahuyentar a Jack y al resto de espíritus nocturnos.

5. Halloween era la ocasión perfecta para encontrar a tu alma gemela.

En algunas zonas de Irlanda, Halloween se celebraba con juegos de adivinación del futuro, según Nicholas Rogers. Se suponía que esos juegos predecían cuándo y con quién te ibas a casar. Como Halloween —igual que el día de San Valentín— era una de las ocasiones en los que los chicos y las chicas podían mezclarse, también era un día perfecto para encontrar pareja. En Estados Unidos, los más jóvenes (particularmente las mujeres) seguían esta vieja tradición irlandesa. Los juegos trataban de predecir el futuro amoroso de las personas, tal y como recoge Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America [Enciclopedia Oxford de comida y bebida en Estados ].

6. En algunas ciudades estadounidenses, Halloween se conocía como ""La noche del repollo"".

El nombre viene de un juego de adivinación escocés; en él, las chicas usaban el tallo del repollo para predecir cómo serían sus futuros maridos. En Framingham, Massachusetts (Estados Unidos), los adolescentes dejaban a un lado las predicciones y se limitaban a recorrer el vecindario tirando repollos a las fachadas de las casas, según Framingham Legends & Lore [Leyendas y folclore de Framingham]. Pero no se trataba de una costumbre aislada: en Estados Unidos, a finales del siglo XIX, los chicos de zonas rurales se divertían tirando repollos, mazorcas de maíz y verduras podridas, según Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure [Caramelos: un siglo de pánico y placer].

7. Algunas protectoras de animales no permiten la adopción de gatos negros en otoño por miedo a que los sacrifiquen en Halloween.

No está claro si se sacrifican gatos negros en Halloween, pero algunas protectoras no permiten la adopción de estos gatos en las fechas cercanas a Halloween. Lynda Garibaldi, directora de la protectora The Cat's Cradle de Morganton, Carolina del Norte (Estados Unidos), explica a la edición estadounidense del HuffPost que esta protectora ""no pone en adopción a gatos negros en octubre por la superstición y la preocupación de que la gente equivocada (gente que les haga daño) pueda adoptarlos"".

Sin embargo, estas restricciones están empezando a desaparecer. Emily Weiss, vicepresidenta del departamento de Investigación y Desarrollo de Protectoras de la Sociedad Estadounidense para la Prevención de la Crueldad hacia los Animales, afirma lo siguiente: ""Hace años era algo muy común —las protectoras no dejaban adoptar gatos en Halloween por miedo a que les pasara algo horrible—, pero ya no pasa tanto. Y muchísimas protectoras fomentan la adopción de gatos negros por Halloween. La mayoría de los que acuden a las protectoras a adoptar una mascota no van a sacrificarla en un ritual"".

8. Hay estudios que demuestran que Halloween hace que los niños se comporten peor.

Según la página web io9, juntar a niños disfrazados y ponerles un objetivo que ansían (chucherías, en este caso) provoca la ""desindividualización"" de los niños. Este término de psicología explica lo que sucede cuando los miembros de un grupo de jóvenes empiezan a preocuparse menos por las consecuencias de sus actos individuales y eso desencadena que hagan cosas que no harían solos.

Un estudio en particular recoge que los niños disfrazados sin supervisión que se reúnen en grupo tienen más probabilidades de robar caramelos y dinero que los niños que no van ni disfrazados ni en grupo. Otra investigación revela que los niños que llevan máscaras tienen muchas más probabilidades de tomarse más caramelos de los que deberían si creen que no hay ningún adulto supervisándolos.

Als Berater und Coach hätte ich doch viel mit erfolgreichen Menschen zu tun, bzw. mit Menschen, die ihren Erfolg sichern, stärken oder noch weiter ausbauen wollen. Da ist es doch irgendwie naheliegend, auch einmal über Erfolg und Erfolgsstreben zu schreiben.

Ich war sofort begeistert. Doch bald darauf kamen Zweifel hoch. Warum soll ich über Erfolg schreiben, das tun doch ohnehin schon so viele. Ich sah plötzlich überall Erfolgsstories - Geschichten, die einen in den Bann der Welt strahlender Erfolge zu ziehen versuchen, bzw. in welcher ich mich selbst, in Konkurrenz mit all den anderen auch schon ins rechte Licht zu rücken suche. In diesem, meinen Zweifel trat Florian Böhm vor mein geistiges Auge. In diesem Moment wusste ich, das ist jener Mensch, der mir Erfolg in einer Weise zeigt, die mich berührt. Er verkörpert für mich jenen Erfolg, einen stillen Erfolg, den ich als Weg der Einsichten bezeichnen würde.

Erfolgsfaktoren

Egal ob KünstlerInnen, Führungskräfte und ManagerInnen, Bürofachkräfte, FacharbeiterInnen, VerkäuferInnen, oder Vater/Mutter von 2 Kindern, ... - jeder, jede will in irgend einer Weise, das was er/sie tut, erfolgreich tun - so auch Florian Böhm. Er ist 1975 geboren, hat in seiner Kindheit und Jugend intensiv Klavier gespielt und auch komponiert - was u.a. einer seiner Lehrer nicht ernst genommen hat. Florian war jedoch nicht nur am Klavier kreativ und begabt, sondern auch darüber hinaus, sprich multidimensional, fachübergreifend schöpferisch und einfallsreich! So war es ihm möglich, später mit einem Studium der Rechtswissenschaften sehr erfolgreich selbstständig zu werden - weniger, weil er das Recht und die Steuerlandschaft so gut beherrschte, was er selbstverständlich auch tut, sondern weil er mit seinem Einfallsreichtum Unternehmen tatkräftig, visionär und einfallsreich an die Hand nehmen und führen konnte. Aktuell konzentriert sich Florian wieder mehr auf seine Tätigkeiten als Künstler.

[...] Rausholen, was in mir steckt. [...]

Das war kein leichter Schritt. Er musste entscheiden, sprich weiterhin als Steuerberater im Alltag seiner Steuer- & Unternehmensberatung erfolgreich tätig sein, oder den Schritt wagen, diese Schaffensphase hinter sich zu lassen und zu 100% als Künstler im Leben zu stehen.

Florian und ich haben ziemlich lange über seinen Weg, seine Entwicklung bzw. im Sinne seiner Schreibweise < ENT.wicklung > gesprochen, die er für sich als „ "" bezeichnen will.

Im Folgenden werde ich abwechselnd Worte und Werke von Florian heranziehen, um sichtbar werden zu lassen, was ihn bewegt und was er unter Erfolg versteht, und meine persönliche Interpretation zu seinen Aussagen anführen, das was in mir durch ihn berührt ist. Dabei kommt mir gleich seine Aussage über Angst ins Gedächtnis.

Erfolg durch Überwindung von Ängsten

[...] Nicht die Ängste, sondern das, was ich aus der Angst mache und wie ich mit ihr umgehe, ist entscheidend. [...]

Erfolg ist die Überwindung von Ängsten, von vorgefassten Meinungen, von eigenen, wie auch fremd aufgebürdeten Grenzen und gleichzeitig das verantwortungsbewusste Respektieren anderer Einstellungen und Lebenskonzepte. Erfolg bedeutet, wenn man seine eigenen Komfortzonen zu verlassen wagt. Damit sind weniger die äußerlichen Komfortzonen, sondern vor allem die geistigen Komfortzonen gemeint: Jene Zonen, wo man spürt, dass es unbequem, unangenehm, sogar beängstigend werden könnte. Beispielsweise, dass man nicht mehr nur brav tut, was andere von einem erwarten, sondern wagt seinen Gefühlen mehr Raum zu geben und damit zusammenhängend auch Entscheidungen trifft, die unter Umständen für andere schwer zu verstehen sind. Komfortzone verlassen heißt, sowie ich es im Gespräch mit Florian verstanden habe, den Mut zu haben zuerst einmal auf Anerkennung im außen zu verzichten und sich selbst näherzukommen.

[...] Meine Ängste stecken dabei immer in mir - aber ich will mich nicht mehr von ihnen dominieren lassen (was nicht immer gelingt). [...]

Es geht dabei jedoch auch nicht um rücksichtsloses, übermütiges, egomanisches Handeln, sondern um die Balance, Grenzen zu überschreiten, ohne damit andere zu verletzen - das ist meinem Empfinden nach ein außerordentlicher Erfolg, aber auch ein außerordentlich hoher Anspruch an sich selbst!

Erfolg durch Selbstbewusstsein

Erfolgt heißt u.a., zur richtigen Zeit, am richtigen Ort, jene Menschen treffen, die die persönliche Entwicklung fördern. Florian hat sich in den letzten Jahren zum besseren Verstehen seines Lebenslaufes - und das seiner Auffassung nach im Wesentlichen ohne Wehmut, Trauer oder Frustration - intensiv mit den vielfältigen Abzweigungen in seinem Leben beschäftigt und daraus die Einsicht gewonnen, anders als früher diese Chancen besser zu nützen, anstatt sich aus Ängsten heraus „zu verkriechen"".

[...] Ich brauche Anstöße, das kann auch von einem Kritiker sein - und nachdem ich mich mit kreativer Arbeit sehr, sehr entblöße, habe ich damit erst umgehen lernen müssen. [...]

Jeder Mensch, eine Organisation, ein Unternehmen, der Status in der Gesellschaft, die Herkunft, die Familie kann einen Erfolg unterstützen, aber genauso gut einen möglichen Erfolg im Keim ersticken. Mit dieser Aussage mag ich, und Florian wird es ähnlich sehen, niemandem zu nahetreten. Wenn das passiert, dann nicht in böser Absicht, sondern aus sozialer Prägung heraus, aus Unwissenheit und Unreflektiertheit, Angst und auch Eifersucht. Ich weiß, Angst und noch viel mehr die Eifersucht sind heikle Themen. Aber ich denke, es gehört zum Erfolg dazu, und es hat Auswirkungen in den Biografien. Im Gespräch mit Florian hat mich ein Punkt, vielleicht weil es mich persönlich auch angeht, stark getroffen:

[...] Ich hatte keinen, der mich mit meinen künstlerischen Talenten so, wie ich es benötigt hätte, an der Hand genommen und mich an mich selbst herangeführt hätte. Ich selbst hatte damals nicht mein heutiges bzw oder auch , diese Dinge ohne Hilfe weiterentwickeln zu können. [...]

Mit der intensiven und auch schmerzhaften Reflexion über seine eigene Geschichte, u.a. auch die eigene Eitelkeit überwinden müssend, hat sich Florians Einstellung zum Erfolg verändert. Florian Böhm spricht heute von Erfolg, wenn er mit seinen Bildern, mit seinen Gedanken und Reflexionen Menschen berühren bzw. zum Nachdenken anregen kann - oder anders ausgedrückt, sich Menschen von seinen Bildern, Gedanken und Reflexionen berühren lassen.

[...] Erfolg ist, sich mit anderen Menschen in Schwingung bringen. [...]

Erfolg durch Leistungsvergleich

Bei genauerer Betrachtung wird Erfolg typischerweise im Vergleich mit anderen betrachtet. Der eine ist u.a. erfolgreich, weil er beispielsweise im Beruf die Karriereleiter hinaufgewandert ist, oder als Schauspieler einen Oskar gewonnen hat, oder ein weltberühmtes Bild gemalt hat, oder erfolgreich die Karriere hinter sich ließ um in den Alpen einen Bio-Bauernhof zu führen. Aus diesem Verständnis heraus zeigt sich Erfolg erst dann, wenn andere eine bestimmte Leistung honorieren, und besser bewerten als die eigenen. So gesehen entsteht Erfolg dadurch, dass andere einem folgen, weil diese meinen, dass das Tun eines Bestimmten besser ist als das von anderen. Erfolgt zeigt sich hier erst im Leistungsvergleich. Auch wenn Florian das nicht unbedingt unter Erfolg versteht, muss er sich diesem Aspekt von Erfolg auch stellen, zumindest habe ich es im Gespräch mit ihm so verstanden.

Erfolg durch Einsicht

Florian sieht jedoch im Erfolg, neben dem vorhin genannten, auch einen anderen, ganz wesentlichen Aspekt: Nämlich, einem „inneren Ruf"", einem inneren Gefühl, einer plötzlich hörbaren inneren Stimme zu folgen, ... Dann ist Erfolg nicht mehr nur an einen Leistungsgedanken gebunden, sondern der Weg des Herzens.

[...] Dinge zu tun, damit ich innerlich „zu:frieden"" bin. [...]

Und gerade dieser Weg kann nach außen hin alles andere als erfolgreich erscheinen, weder außergewöhnlich, noch spannend, noch überdurchschnittlich kreativ oder musikalisch oder sonst wie überdurchschnittlich gut. Erfolg ist dann vielmehr die Einsicht, das Leben so zu nehmen wie es ist, sich vielleicht sogar vom typischen Erfolgsstreben zu lösen, von dem Drang nach Anerkennung, von dem Drang, gesehen, gelobt, beklatscht, mit Geld überhäuft zu werden. Dann ist Erfolg die Einsicht, das Ego besser kennenzulernen, die Begierden, Wünsche, unerfüllten Sehnsüchte respektvoll zu behandeln, aber auch zu erkennen, dass man mit der Erfüllung aller Wünsche auch nicht das so erstrebte Glück, den persönlichen Erfolg erfahren wird. Erfolg ist so gesehen viel mehr der Weg der Selbsterkenntnis, der Zuwendung an die unfassbare Kraft und Energie des Lebens - und die bescheidene Einsicht, jeder Mensch ist etwas Besonderes und gleichzeitig nur ein Windhauch in der unendlichen Zeit im unendlichen Universum.

Erfolg durch Wahrnehmung der Grenzen

Die Erfolgs-Geschichten-Antreiber sind Gefühle, die befriedigt werden wollen - aktiv als Erfolgs-Geschichten-ProduzentInnen, wie bei Florian Böhm und passiv als Erfolgs-Geschichten-KonsumentInnen, unter die ich mich persönlich vorwiegend zählen würde. Sicherlich gibt es hie und da einen Rollenwechsel, doch meist bleibt man in seinem aktiven oder passiven Erfolgsstreben hängen, wechselt nicht die Seite. Das sieht man kaum, wirkt im Schleier der unbewussten Wirkungskräfte.

Ursprünglich bezeichnete der Begriff Erfolg lediglich die allgemeine Folge, Konsequenz oder Effekt eines Handelns. Mitunter wurde mit dem Begriff bloß das Erfolgen bzw. der (schicksalhafte) Verlauf eines Ereignisses beschrieben. Erst später, insbesondere mit der Industrialisierung, erhielt Erfolg die Bedeutung eines Resultats. Dieses Konzept ist die Basis für zahlreiche weitere Theorien des Erfolges, deren gemeinsamer Nenner es ist, Erfolg als die Fähigkeit zu interpretieren, seine selbst gesetzten Ziele zu erreichen. Zur Operationalisierung dient dabei das Konzept der Umsetzungskompetenz, mit dem man die Ausprägung der Fähigkeit messen kann, Absichten, Ziele und Kenntnisse in Ergebnisse umzuwandeln. So scheint es nicht verwunderlich, wenn Erfolg mit Leistung verkettet wird. Die Aussagen bzw. vielmehr die Bewertungen von Erfolg sind stark verbunden mit dem Wertesystem der Beurteilenden. Die Kultur, in der man lebt und arbeitet, prägt die Sichtweise von Erfolg.[1] So gesehen ist es für all jene schwieriger, die Erfolg in einer anderen Weise als der Mainstream wahrnehmen. Da stößt Erfolg an Grenzen.

Florian Böhm nimmt die Grenzen wahr, geht mit Begleitung der Angst und Zweifel weiter, trifft auf Menschen, lässt sich von Menschen berühren und berührt Menschen. Florian verkörpert für mich den stillen, unauffälligen Erfolg, das, was ich als Weg der Selbsterkenntnis bezeichnen würde.

It was writer and publisher Thomas Baekdal who first drew our attention to the mess that is the Google hamburger. Not only did they include a tomato under the lettuce (everyone knows they are just a soggy-bun inducing disaster) but they also made the executive decision to put the cheese slice under the hamburger. Ensuring a soggy bottom as well as top. And to think this horror show went through several rounds of approval. In response Pichai has promised that Google will resolve their mistakes this week, but only if the internet can agree on the correct way to do this - which doesn’t hold much hope for actually getting this sorted anytime soon.

The Hubble telescope was scanning exoplanet Kepler-13Ab, located outside of our solar system, when they found the vicious storms of titanium dioxide - the active ingredient in sunscreen - raining down.

It might sound like something from science fiction, but NASA scientists have just found a blisteringly hot planet where it actually ‘snows’ suncream.

The team of astronomers at Penn State didn’t go looking for the titanium dioxide but were studying Kepler-13Ab as it is one of the hottest known exoplanets and so is able to provide insight into the complexity of weather and atmospheric conditions.

And may someday be useful for gauging the habitability of earth-sized planets.

Lead author Thomas Beatty said: “In many ways, the atmospheric studies we’re doing now on these gaseous ‘hot Jupiter’ kind of planets are test beds for how we’re going to do atmospheric studies of terrestrial, Earth-like planets.”

During their exploration they found that the planet’s atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes, which was surprising because it is the complete opposite of what happens on other hot Jupiters.

They concluded there must be something at play causing this to happen, and made the first detections of this “snow-out” process ever recorded.

The reason it is missing in the first place is because powerful winds carry it around, condensing it into crystalline flakes that form clouds.

Jason Wright, study co-author, explained why it is so important to understand these exoplanet conditions, saying: “Understanding what sets the climates of other worlds has been one of the big puzzles of the last decade, seeing this cold-trap process in action provides us with a long sought and important piece of that puzzle.”",Hubble Discovers A Giant Boiling Planet Where It Quite Literally 'Snows' Sunscreen,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/hubble-discovers-giant-boiling-planet-where-it-quite-literally-snows-sunscreen_uk_59f2f0d3e4b07fdc5fbd5116

Casting doubts on the police theory, Ali said, ""In the (Bhopal) Central Jail, it is not possible to open a lock from inside the cell. But as per the account of the police, eight persons made keys, opened the locks, came out of cells, managed to break out of barrack too, walked passed all security with no camera functioning that day, and scaled the walls.""

Raising further questions on the encounter, Ali wondered how the eight men allegedly killed one guard while leaving the other unharmed and then dressed up, shaved and covered just 10 kms in eight hours after which they were shot dead.

""We have come to know through the media that the probe by justice (retired) SK Pandey Commission has given a clean-chit to administration. Once the report is tabled in the Assembly and we get it, we can challenge it in the high court"", he said.

The lawyers have claimed that there are many loopholes in the investigation — ranging from contradictions in versions given by officials of the escapees being armed or unarmed and on the recovery of weapons. ""After the encounter, media persons had reached spot but no weapon was to be found, yet later in the evening the police had suddenly claimed that weapons were found on the spot.""

""They were all killed in cold-blood, shot in upper part of body and no policemen had any bullet injury.""

""How can there be a fair probe when officers remain at the same post. IG Yogesh Chaudhary is still heading Bhopal range. He was not shifted. It is also strange that the police killed all the eight persons, even pumping bullets into the injured as footage revealed. If even one person was caught alive, we would have come to know how the jailbreak happened but they were all killed in cold-blood, shot in upper part of body and no policemen had any bullet injury"", Ali added.

The lawyers claimed that the encounter was fake, unless proved otherwise. They insisted that facts about encounter were kept hidden by administration and the truth must be brought out in public.

They said that the persons killed were not convicted in any terror case and that legal fight would continue – the police officials involved in it would be made accused through filing a private complaint in court, subsequently.

The encounter had taken place on the night of October 31, 2016. The state government had appointed a one-member inquiry commission that has submitted its report to the government.","A Year After Bhopal Jail Break And Encounter Deaths Of 8 SIMI Activists, Loopholes Remain In Probe, Say Lawyers",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/30/a-year-after-bhopal-jail-break-and-encounter-deaths-of-8-simi-activists-loopholes-remain-in-probe-say-lawyers_a_23260478/

“President Bush would never — under any circumstance — intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended Ms. Lind,” Jim McGrath, a Bush spokesman, told HuffPost Wednesday in a statement.

Later Wednesday, Bush’s office issued a second statement saying that the former president “has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner” and that because he is confined to a wheelchair, “his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures.”

In a now-deleted Instagram post on Tuesday, Lind said she posed with Bush, who was in a wheelchair, for a photo-op during a private screening in Houston of her AMC television series, “Turn: Washington’s Spies.” “He sexually assaulted me,” she wrote in the post, according to reports.

Mike Pont via Getty Images Heather Lind, pictured in June, said she has since learned her own power to deal with such incidents.

“He didn’t shake my hand,” Lind wrote. “He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side. He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again. Barbara rolled her eyes as if to say ‘not again.’ His security guard told me I shouldn’t have stood next to him for the photo.”

“We all circled around him and Barbara for a photo, and I was right next to him,” she said. “He reached his right hand around to my behind, and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group, ‘Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?’ As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, ‘David Cop-a-Feel!’”

Lind said she has learned to use her own personal power against those who wield theirs inappropriately. “It seems to me a President’s power is in his or her capacity to enact positive change, actually help people, and serve as a symbol of our democracy. He relinquished that power when he used it against me and, judging from the comments of those around him, countless other women before me. What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn’t so different from a President really.”

Aaron M Sprecher/Invision for AMC/AP Images Lind, center, said the former president ""touched"" her twice during this photo opp and that former first lady Barbara Bush was aware.

Lind said she was moved to recount the experience after seeing a photo of the 93-year-old Bush with former President Barack Obama at the One America Appeal hurricane relief concert. She said she was disturbed that Bush was afforded such reverence.

Un constat alarmant qui doit nous inviter à libérer notre parole autour de la sexualité pour protéger les plus jeunes.

Le sexe est un sujet bien trop important pour ne pas être pris au sérieux. Le temps où il était rangé sur les étagères des vieux tabous, en France, doit passer; il est devenu un véritable fait de société, un marqueur de notre temps avec ses problématiques propres. Nous devons donc nous l'approprier pour en débattre. Et parmi les questions qui reviennent fréquemment, il en est une, notamment, qu'il me semble primordiale de traiter. Comment sensibiliser les enfants à la sexualité alors qu'ils passent de plus en plus de temps sur Internet, ce temple de l'ultra-violence parfois subie?

Aujourd'hui, il est deux manières antagonistes de confronter les pré-adolescents qui se lancent à la découverte de la vie à la problématique sexuelle. L'une, la pornographie, est brutale, malveillante et, donc, non désirable. L'autre, l'éducation sexuelle, est mesurée, constructive et, donc, à privilégier. Le problème, c'est que la première, qui pullule de plus en plus sur le Web, est extrêmement facile d'accès pour l'enfant, qui sera la plupart du temps gêné d'aborder la question avec son entourage.

Heureusement, il existe un consensus sur ce point, que nulle croyance religieuse ni partisanerie politique ne délégitime: il faut à tout prix détourner les jeunes yeux de la pornographie. Les conséquences, dans le cas inverse, sont connues: les enfants ont une fausse idée de ce qu'est le sexe, qu'ils associent à un acte de violence, éventuellement reproduit plus tard. Les vidéos que l'on peut consommer sur les écrans d'ordinateur jouent la plupart du temps sur les rapports de domination — hétérosexuelle comme homosexuelle. Dont le pendant indésirable est, logiquement, la soumission, celle-ci étant fréquemment poussée à l'extrême.

Le danger des sites de streaming illégaux

Là où le bât blesse, c'est que la pornographie en ligne ne se niche pas uniquement sur des sites Internet dédiés. L'une de ses destinations préférées? Les plateformes de streaming illégal, permettant de regarder des films et des séries gratuitement -mais de manière illicite-, qui regorgent parfois de publicités pornographiques indésirables. Elles prennent dans la plupart des cas la forme de ""pop-up"", et surgissent devant la fenêtre principale de navigation, sans avoir été sollicitées par l'utilisateur. Qui peut avoir vite fait de cliquer dessus.

Cette pratique, absolument illégale, est d'autant plus immorale que les enfants naviguent sur Internet de plus en plus jeunes. D'après l'association Ennocence, spécialisée dans la protection des enfants contre les risques d'exposition à la pornographie en ligne, ces derniers ont en moyenne 11 ans lorsqu'ils sont exposés pour la première fois à des images pornographiques sur la Toile. Et 14% des 9-16 ans et 36% des 15-16 ans ont déjà surfé sans le vouloir sur l'un de ces ""sites pour adulte"". Pour l'association, la cible à abattre est d'ailleurs cette fameuse fenêtre pop-up, responsable à 72% des glissements non provoqués vers des sites classés X.

Pour ce faire, il existe plusieurs solutions, rappelle Ennocence. L'usage d'un logiciel de contrôle parental et l'utilisation d'un bloqueur de publicités sont ainsi fortement conseillés. Et parce qu'aucune de ces solutions n'est efficace à 100%, et que rien ne vaut la prévention verbale, l'association -et je la rejoins fortement sur ce point- préconise aux parents, mais également à toute personne susceptible d'encadrer des jeunes, la discussion. De la même manière qu'il ne faut pas tourner le dos à un enfant qui pose des questions sur la sexualité -ce qui est non seulement normal, mais souhaitable-, il faut l'avertir, à partir d'un certain âge, sur ces ""prédateurs sexuels"" que sont les sites malveillants.

C'est ce qu'il est ressorti de la vingtaine de ""Cafés-sexo"" que j'ai organisés depuis 2015: la parole doit être libérée autour de la sexualité, qui n'est ni un sujet tabou ni de la pornographie, bien au contraire. Il est d'ailleurs très révélateur que l'éducation nationale ait fini par s'emparer du sujet dans sa globalité affective, psycho-affective et sociale. Reste simplement à amplifier la prévention contre cette éducation sexuelle 2.0 dangereuse pour les enfants et les adultes qu'ils seront.

Like those reforms, the goal of expanding Canada's Working Income Tax Benefit program is to enhance the value of work and to encourage recipients to increase their work effort.
As their income increases, this tax benefit will be gradually phased out, until it reaches a maximum income that varies from province to province.

Increasing the funding of the Working Income Tax Benefit does not place a disproportionate burden on employers, and does not run the risk of increasing unemployment among those it purports to help.","A measure that has not garnered much attention yet in the federal government's economic update is the expansion of the Working Income Tax Benefit program. This is unfortunate, because if there's a way to do social programs right, this is probably it. This program is designed to increase the value of work to people currently on government assistance by giving an income boost to individuals and families with low incomes. What's so great about this is that it does not increase the fiscal burden, but actually reduces it, while being based on particularly sound economics.

In fact, American experience with this kind of policy has yielded impressive results in terms of reducing the share of the population using social programs by increasing participation in the workforce. Over a period of less than 15 years, the proportion of the population receiving social assistance fell by more than 70 per cent, largely as a result of these programs.

Starting in the early 1990s, several U.S. states began reforming their social assistance systems, and this was followed by a 1996 federal reform signed into law by President Bill Clinton. These changes aimed to make social assistance less attractive, and work relatively more attractive, for the purpose of guiding existing social assistance recipients toward the job market while reducing the number of new recipients.

Reforms along similar lines were also introduced elsewhere in many OECD countries during the 1990s, moving from unconditional assistance to conditional aid leading eventually to self-sufficiency. These reforms included various restrictions and requirements, and applied to limited groups of recipients.

We critics of the government's intervention in the economy are quick to assign blame when it errs with misguided policies, but we should also cheer when it does things right.

Like those reforms, the goal of expanding Canada's Working Income Tax Benefit program is to enhance the value of work and to encourage recipients to increase their work effort. To do this, paid work must become more rewarding than the alternative of simply receiving a cheque.

Current plans, before this latest announcement, were for Canadians to have about 26 per cent of their tax burden from their work income reimbursed as soon as they earn at least $3,000 starting in 2019. As their income increases, this tax benefit will be gradually phased out, until it reaches a maximum income that varies from province to province. The government has yet to reveal the details of how this program will be affected by the additional $500 million it has just announced.

As a general rule, the more labour income is taxed, the less people are encouraged to work. But social program recipients face even more extreme disincentives to work. As they increase their work income, they begin to contribute to pension plans, employment insurance, and other withholdings and contributions. And most importantly, for every additional dollar earned, they see their welfare cheques reduced, sometimes almost dollar for dollar. This creates the so-called poverty trap, in which, ironically, it might not be in the immediate financial interest of recipients to better their situation through work.

Programs like the Working Income Tax Benefit provide a supplement to low-income workers to improve their financial situation and make work more attractive, and help claimants to access the labour market, where earnings are generally higher than welfare benefits. Where such measures have been implemented, they have reduced poverty.

Filling out a 2012 Revenue Canada General T1 tax form.

In comparison with the $15 minimum wage, whose proponents mistakenly suggest it can reduce poverty, the economics behind incentives to work are proven, well researched, and generally uncontroversial. Increasing the funding of the Working Income Tax Benefit does not place a disproportionate burden on employers, and does not run the risk of increasing unemployment among those it purports to help.

Not only are the economics behind this reform sound, but it is a clear example of solving a public policy problem through more economic freedom, rather than attempting to do so through ever more government intervention. Instead of increasing spending on social programs, the government is essentially doing what it has to do to tax these people less than it used to in the past.

We critics of the government's intervention in the economy are quick to assign blame when it errs with misguided policies, but we should also cheer when it does things right. This is one of those occasions.

Als die beiden in der Küche sind, wird es heiß

Bauer Klaus sprüht in der aktuellen Folge ""Bauer sucht Frau"" nur so vor Testosteron, denn die thailändische Kandidatin Tiwaporn hat es ihm angetan. So heißt sie übrigens wirklich. Eigentlich ganz leicht zu merken: Nicht Youporn, sondern Tiwaporn.

Tiwaporn scheint sich ebenfalls zu Klaus hingezogen zu fühlen. Das liegt allerdings auch an den Tricks, die der listige Bauer anwendet. Als die beiden den Stall ausmisten, erklärt Klaus seiner Tiwaporn noch einmal ganz genau, wie das mit der Mistgabel funktioniert. Dazu stellt er sich natürlich hinter Tiwaporn und hilft ihr von hinten beim Führen der Mistgabel. Das ist schließlich gar nicht so einfach.

""Ich habe bei Tiwaporn den Tennislehrer-Trick angewendet"", erklärt er den RTL-Reportern. Tatsächlich ist der Trick Tennis-Spielerinnen nur allzu bekannt. Denn der ein oder andere Lehrer stellt auf ähnliche Weise gerne mal seine Lehrer-Qualitäten unter Beweis - vor allem in klischeehaften Filmen. Oder eben bei ""Bauer sucht Frau"".

Klaus: ""Wie Händchen halten, nur mit Mistgabel""

""Auf diese Weise komme ich Tiwaporn näher"", erklärt Klaus sein ausgefuchstes Vorgehen. ""Das ist wie Händchen halten, nur eben mit einer Mistgabel.""

Und es funktioniert. Tiwaporn ist ganz hingerissen vom intimen Stall-Ausmisten. Als die beiden schließlich in die Küche gehen, wird es richtig heiß. Denn sie gehen Klaus' liebstem Hobby nach: Bauernbrot backen.

Bewundernd sieht Tiwaporn zu, wie leidenschaftlich der Bauer seinen Teig knetet. ""Schneller!"", befiehlt sie. Klaus gehorcht zunächst - doch dann greift er zu einem weiteren gewieften Trick: Er beginnt, Tiwaporn zu bestäuben. Das ist natürlich wörtlich gemeint.

Der flirtbegabte Bauer greift sich eine Hand voll Mehl und stäubt die Thailänderin ein. Sie kichert und die Bestäubung nimmt ihren Lauf.

Und auch das Bauernbrot ist ein voller Erfolg: Sehr knackig und sehr braun (also gut, ein bisschen verbrannt) kommt es aus dem Ofen. Jetzt fehlen eigentlich nur noch die Kinder. Bis dahin müssen die beiden das ganze Bauernbrot allein vernaschen.

“I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago,” Spacey wrote. “But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”

Er habe mit seiner Partnerin Felicitas Rombold Pläne geschmiedet, ganz nach Barcelona zu ziehen, ""erst recht, nachdem unser Sohn geboren wurde"". Aber nun falle es ihm schwerer, seit er ""fassungslos"" die Nachrichten in spanischen und deutschen Zeitungen lese, die davon handeln, dass Katalonien sich von Spanien abspalten will. Seitdem frage er sich, ""ob Barcelona das noch ist oder sein kann: Heimat. Oder ob man gerade dabei ist, mir etwas zu nehmen"".

Einer wie er, der ""dieses goldene, gleißende Licht der mediterranen Sonne"" über alles liebt, ""die offenherzigen Menschen, die Märkte, die Bars"", spüre nun, ""wie der Konflikt an mich heranreicht, wie ich in meinem ganz persönlichen Umfeld Gräben beobachte, die jeden Tag tiefer werden"".

""Ich habe mich immer als Europäer gefühlt""

Daniel Brühl ist wie viele andere Katalanen gegen die Abspaltung von Spanien, ""weil ich, Sohn eines Deutschen und einer Spanierin aus Barcelona, mich immer als Europäer gefühlt habe. Und weil mich das immun gemacht hat gegen die Engstirnigkeit, die ich jetzt in Katalonien wahrnehme"".

2006 hatte Brühl die Hauptrolle in Manuel Huergas Film ""Salvador - Kampf um die Freiheit"". Er spielte den jungen katalanischen Anarchisten Salvador Puig Antich, der gegen die spanische Franco-Diktatur gekämpft hatte und dafür 1974 hingerichtet wurde. Daniel Brühl schildert in seinem ""SZ""-Beitrag die Sympathien, die ihm in Barcelona entgegenströmten als der Film in die Kinos kam: ""Man identifizierte mich so sehr mit dem Protagonisten, dass ich damals in Barcelona fast nur auf Katalanisch angesprochen wurde. Ich kann mich noch gut erinnern, wie unwohl ich mich fühlte, wenn ich auf Spanisch antwortete"".

Er verstehe zwar Katalanisch ""perfekt"", doch es falle ihm schwer, Katalanisch zu sprechen. ""Das war auch nie ein Problem. Meine Gesprächspartner wechselten ins Spanische, wenn sie merkten, dass ich kein Katalanisch sprach"", so Brühl. In letzter Zeit sei es ihm aber passiert, ""dass Gesprächspartner ihr Katalanisch durchzogen, demonstrativ. Ich fürchte, das gehorcht einer Stimmung: Die da draußen gehören nicht zu uns. Das sind tendenziell Rechte"".

Es mache ihn fassungslos, wenn er höre, dass die Filmemacherin Isabel Coixet (57), eine linksorientierte Katalanin, ""auf der Straße als Faschistin beschimpft wurde, weil sie gegen die Unabhängigkeit ist"".

Aufgeheizte Stimmung innerhalb der Familie

Die Lage sei so aufgeheizt, dass es in seiner eigenen Familie auseinandergehe. ""Es gibt einige, die extrem für die Unabhängigkeit sind... Andere sind radikal dagegen. Im Freundeskreis ist es ähnlich, und ich ertappe mich dabei, wie ich dem Thema ausweiche, um Freundschaften nicht zu gefährden"", erklärt der Schauspieler.

Brühl hält das Referendum zur Unabhängigkeit für ""illegal"", für ""eine Farce"", weil es ""nicht mal den Mindestanforderungen an eine demokratische Abstimmung entsprach"". Er glaube nicht, dass die Mehrheit der Katalanen für eine Loslösung von Spanien sei. Doch jetzt, wo die Zentralregierung in Madrid die katalanischen Institutionen unter ihre Kontrolle stellen will, ""dürfte es wieder mehr Zulauf für jene geben, die sich abspalten wollen. Denn das verletzt die Katalanen in ihrem Stolz"", gibt Brühl zu bedenken.",Daniel Brühl: Wie sein spanisches Herz leidet,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/30/daniel-bruhl-wie-sein-spanisches-herz-leidet_n_18420124.html?utm_hp_ref=germany&amp;ir=Germany

The foster mother of a 3-year-old Indian girl, whose body was found on Sunday from a culvert near their home in suburban Dallas, has denied any involvement in the death of her daughter.

Lawyers Michelle Nolte and Gregg Gibbs, representing Sini Mathews published a statement late yesterday saying she denied any involvement in the death of her adoptive daughter.

In the statement, the lawyers insist that Mathews cooperated with the Richardson Police investigation into her daughter's disappearance on October 7. She was ""interrogated for hours by several officers with no attorney present"" a few days later, as per the statement.

The statement adds, ""Now that Mr Mathews has turned himself into the police and told them what happened to Sherin, we see no need for Mrs Mathews to endure further police interrogation. She had nothing to do with Sherin's death or the removal of her body from the home.""

The lawyers write that Mathews is ""trying to grieve for her lost daughter while still caring for her remaining daughter. She is struggling to pick up the pieces of a shattered life.""

""Now that Mr Mathews has turned himself into the police and told them what happened to Sherin, we see no need for Mrs Mathews to endure further police interrogation. She had nothing to do with Sherin's death or the removal of her body from the home.""

Texas Department of Family and Protective Services spokesperson confirmed that Mathews' four-year-old daughter remains in foster care.

Richardson Police had no immediate comment to the statement.

The police previously said Sini Mathews initially cooperated in the investigation on October 7, but then stopped. This week, police said Mathews provided dental records and identified clothing found with Sherin's body in order to help the medical examiner make a positive ID.

Police also said Mathews never provided a full account of what happened when Sherin died.

Wesley Mathews is the only person charged with a crime in Sherin's disappearance and death. On Monday, police arrested him for a second time on an injury to a child charge after he told them that Sherin choked on milk.

According to court records, Wesley Mathews previously told detectives his wife was sleeping when Sherin disappeared.

Earlier, Wesley Mathews, was booked into to the Dallas County Jail yesterday and has been placed under suicide watch.

Mathews originally told police his daughter Sherin disappeared while being punished, when she was forced to stand outside by a tree at 3 am for not drinking her milk. Later when the body was found, he changed his story and said that his daughter choked to death after he ""physically assisted"" her in drinking her milk.

Meanwhile, a petition has been started by community leader Father Thomas to not hand over the body of Sherin Mathews to her parents, and rather to the community, so that proper memorial and burial service could be done.",Foster Mother Of 3-Year-Old Dead Indian Girl 'Struggling To Pick Up The Pieces Of A Shattered Life',http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/26/foster-mother-of-3-year-old-dead-indian-girl-struggling-to-pick-up-the-pieces-of-a-shattered-life_a_23256380/

NEW DELHI -- In a bid to counter the opposition campaign, the BJP will celebrate November 8, the day high value currencies were demonetised last year, as ""Anti-Black Money Day"" across the country.

Announcing the party's decision to counter the opposition plans for observing the day as ""Black Day"", Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said all prominent leaders, union ministers, state ministers and office bearers will participate in programmes across the country.

On November 8, the party will organise programmes highlighting all the steps the government has taken against black money. He said since the government was formed in 2014, from day one it had taken steps against black money.

""There was a parallel black money economy in the country. When the NDA government came to power (May 2014), Prime Minister Narendra Modi took steps to minimise and end it. On November 8, the BJP will celebrate 'Anti-Black Money Day' and mobilise people in favour of the steps taken against black money,"" Jaitley told reporters here.

The special investigation team (SIT) to go into black money, which was directed by the Supreme Court in 2011 and was not acted upon by the previous UPA government, was formed by the NDA, the Finance Minister said.

He said the government also brought in laws to check black money by giving a last opportunity to those who had stashed money abroad by offering them 60% for repatriating their assets.

""The account holders in Liechtenstein and HSBC have all been assessed and criminal action has been filed against them. The government has also worked internationally under the G20 framework and other fora, including an agreement with Switzerland, to get real time information on black money stashed abroad to evade tax.

""Agreements with Mauritius and Cyprus that allowed round tripping of money have been reworked.""

Jaitley also hit out at the Congress over its plans to observe the day because the demonetisation decision was ""ill conceived"".

""Various account holders in banks which were illegal, cases were filed against them. Demonetisation was a big step towards it. It was a huge step for squeezing cash economy, cash-based transactions and widened the tax base. All the three steps were the positive results of demonetisation and along with GST it would make cash generation difficult.""

Apparently referring to the opposition criticism, Jaitley said it was normal for political parties which had a number of opportunities to be in power earlier not recognize that the squeeze on black money and the other steps cannot be achieved through baby steps.

The Finance Minister said the BJP would carry forward the debate by the opposition to polarize people against black money through its own campaign.

Asked whether the Prime Minister would participate in the campaign, Jaitley said the details were being worked out.

Asked about Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's remarks that demonetisation was the biggest blunder, the BJP leader said he could not recall a single significant step taken by the Congress against black money.

""They have reconciled to India living with black money. I can understand their discomfort. The Congress had adequate opportunities to be in power and I cannot recollect a single significant step that they ever took against black money. The steps taken by the NDA government are not small,"" the BJP leader said.

He said the statements by the Congress and its leaders showed that they had not understood the objective behind demonetisation.

""Cash is bearer money in the system and its ownership is not known. It has an anonymous odour and anyone can use it. When cash gets deposited in banks, it gets into a lawful system. So for an entry into lawful system you are liable to pay tax. The entry into the formal system requires payment of tax and is not money laundering.""

Referring to questions about money deposited after demonetisation to convert black into white, Jaitley said mere depositing of money doesn't make it legal. ""Eighteen lakh people have been found to have deposited money disproportionate to their source of income.""

""Confiscation of money was never the objective of demonetisation. Squeezing of cash and that used by terrorists and negating counterfeit currency were the objectives of the note ban. I think once the fundamentals of the objective are understood, they (the Congress) will appreciate it better.""

The Congress led 18 opposition parties on Tuesday said they will observe November 8 as Black Day to protest against the ""ill-conceived and hasty"" decision of the government to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes a year ago.

Replying to another question, he said: ""The government and the party feel that people are cleverer than you (Congress) and they are supporting us. This is not a one-off campaign and will continue to persist as part of the larger programme of the party.""

Replying to a question on the Congress criticism of the government's Tuesday announcement of re-capitalisation of banks, he said: ""Those who have destroyed the country are now preaching, Between 2008-12, there was indiscriminate lending by which banks were made hollow.",Government Decides To Celebrate November 8 As 'Anti-Black Money Day',http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/25/government-decides-to-celebrate-november-8-as-anti-black-money-day_a_23255435/

Liberal backbencher Yvan Baker said the bill — called the Phones Down, Heads Up Act — would impose fines for anyone caught using a cellphone or electronic device while crossing the street.

Named after the shambling supernatural creatures, the ""zombie bill"" would encourage pedestrians to put down electronic devices by imposing fines ranging from $50 for a first offence to $125 for a third offence.

""If you walk the streets, you see people on their cellphones crossing the road using their phones,"" Baker said. ""Experts tell us that if you are distracted as a pedestrian that you are more likely to get hurt.""

Earlier:

In the first nine months of this year, 25 pedestrians died on Toronto streets. Last year, 43 pedestrians were hit and killed on city streets.

According to Ontario's chief coroner, 11 out of 95 pedestrian deaths in 2010 involved people distracted by a cellphone or electronic device. A 2015 Toronto Public Health report found inattentive pedestrians were 40 per cent more likely to be struck.

""It's about raising awareness about risky behaviour because limiting that behaviour will save lives,"" Baker said.

The bill would only allow exceptions for pedestrians calling emergency services, or when they're continuing a phone call started before crossing the road and municipalities would have the ability to opt-out of the law.

Rising pedestrian deaths have prompted other jurisdictions to pass laws targeting distracted walking. Earlier this month, for example, Honolulu became the first U.S. city to ban people from texting or using digital devices while crossing roads.

Mark Blinch/Reuters

In July, Toronto city council passed a resolution asking the Ontario government to amend the Highway Traffic Act to make it illegal to use a cellphone while crossing the street. Last February, the city of Montreal also called on the Quebec government to make it illegal for pedestrians to text while crossing intersections.

Private member's bills seldom become law and Premier Kathleen Wynne would not commit government support for the proposed legislation but called it an ""interesting idea."" Crossing the street with divided attention is risky, she said, noting motorists are barred from driving while looking at their phones.

""The number of people I see walking in the middle of a big intersection with their face down looking at their phone, I think it's incredibly dangerous,"" Wynne said.

New Democrat Cheri Di Novo said the proposed law sends the wrong message and the government should instead beef up distracted-driving penalties.

""Extremely dangerous signal'

""It sends a signal that victims are to blame and not distracted drivers,""Di Novo said. ""That's an extremely dangerous signal to send.""

Brian Patterson, president of the Ontario Safety League, said he's not concerned the law would be too difficult to enforce.

""I don't see this as an opportunity for the police department...to man every intersection in this province,"" Patterson said. ""What we need to do is raise the awareness that this is a very high risk.""

Dylan Reid, spokesman for pedestrian-safety advocacy group Walk Toronto, called the bill ""bad and redundant."" Pedestrians should always pay attention to where they're walking, but its up to drivers not to interfere with people as they use crosswalks with the proper right-of-way, Reid said.

""Being hit by a car is a much bigger disincentive than a $50 fine,"" Reid said. ""Pedestrian inattention is a bit of a red herring. It distracts people from the things that will actually make a difference — which are better infrastructure and getting drivers to not look at their phones and pay attention.""

Quel costume choisir pour son enfant à Halloween? Plutôt que d'aller acheter un quelconque déguisement dans une grande surface, ce moment peut être l'occasion de passer du temps en famille, en fabriquant les costumes de ces petits monstres avec eux.

Interrogés par Le HuffPost, plusieurs professionnels soulignent les bienfaits de ces activités manuelles. Elles invitent non seulement l'enfant à la créativité, mais permettent aussi de renforcer les liens à travers une expérience commune.

Le plaisir de la réalisation

""L'éducation d'un enfant se fait essentiellement dans l'interaction, dans la relation"", explique ainsi Christiane Laurent, psychopraticienne relationnelle. Cette interaction ne se fait pas seulement par la parole, avec ses autorisations, ses interdictions, et ses explications, mais aussi à travers le ""faire ensemble"". Celui-ci s'exprime par la cuisine, le jardinage... ou par la préparation de ces costumes.

""Fabriquer ensemble un costume c'est confronter le désir de l'enfant à la réalité de la réalisation, le confronter peut-être à une certaine frustration"", poursuit-elle. Les désirs de l'enfant font face à ce qu'il est possible de faire... mais, rassure Christiane Laurent, cela sera ""compensé par le plaisir de la réalisation finale"".

""La réussite donne un sentiment de compétence"", valide de son côté la psychiatre Christine Barois. D'autant plus que ces travaux, avec la concentration qu'ils impliquent, nous placent dans un certain état émotionnel, qui est partagé entre les parents et les enfants. ""Cela crée une expérience commune"", qui renforce les liens, comme pour des amis qui ont vécu les mêmes choses.

L'équilibre entre le défi et les compétences est totalement réalisable, rassure-t-elle, en s'amusant: ""il ne s'agit pas de faire de la haute couture, ça peut être utiliser du papier crépon, faire un maquillage...""

Apprendre par la créativité

""Les costumes, c'est une bonne façon de passer par le jeu, par les mains"", explique de son côté Clémence Prompsy, psychologue chez Kidz et Family. Elle évoque la pédagogie Montessori, qui vise à l'apprentissage à travers le ludique et le manuel. En travaillant sur son costume, l'enfant apprend, de manière créative.

""C'est montrer à l'enfant que l'on peut faire preuve de créativité, inventer, se démarquer des codes"", reconnaît elle aussi Christiane Laurent, qui défend cette créativité, source d'intelligence et d'adaptabilité. Le jeune n'apprend pas seulement à faire son costume, mais aussi à sortir des chemins tracés, lui montrer que l'on peut se débrouiller avec les moyens du bord: des vieux tissus, du maquillage...

""Autoriser l'enfant à faire preuve de créativité l'aidera à développer sa confiance en lui, et en fera un adulte plus autonome, plus capable de s'adapter aux aléas de la vie"", précise-t-elle.

Vaincre les peurs enfantines

""Cela peut permettre aux enfants de jouer avec leurs angoisses"" rajoute Clémence Prompsy. En se déguisant en monstres, en méchants, on prend de la distance avec. ""L'enfant à besoin de poser sa peur sur quelque chose"", rappelle-t-elle, ""avant l'âge de 7 ans, on ne peut pas le raisonner"". Il faut donc passer par le jeu pour l'aider à faire face, en restant en lien avec sa ""pensée magique"".

Et surtout, ce moment de bricolage crée de bons souvenirs, partagés par tous et qui restent bien après qu'Halloween soit passé...

Auch der Kontrolleur und der schwarze Mann.
Das weiß ich alles nicht, was ich aber sicher weiß, ist das mein Schweigen ihn in seiner Sicht bestätigt.
Das macht mich nicht zu einem schlechten Menschen, aber sicher auch nicht zu einem guten.","Es gibt Momente im Leben, wo das eigene Selbstbild plötzlich völlig in Frage gestellt wird. Momente, wo fast alles, woran man geglaubt hat, sich als falsch erweist.

So einen Moment hatte ich vor Kurzem in der U-Bahn.

Ich dachte eigentlich immer von mir, dass ich ein offener Mensch sei. Liberal, aber gegen Rassismus, würde ich für meine Werte einstehen und diese - wenn nötig - auch verteidigen.

Jetzt weiß ich, dass ich falsch lag.

Ich war vor ein paar Tagen in der U-Bahn unterwegs. Autofahren war nie so mein Ding und die Dellen in meinem alten Wagen geben mir da recht. Daher habe ich schon seit Jahren eine Monatskarte.

Als ein gekünstelt freundliches ""Servus, die Fahrscheine bitte!"" durch den Wagon gerufen wurde, war ich daher auch wenig beunruhigt.

Routiniert zeigte ich mein Ticket, der Kontrolleur schaute ebenso routiniert drauf und wandte sich dem älteren Ehepaar mir gegenüber zu, die es mir gleich taten. So ging es dann immer weiter, ein Fahrgast nach dem anderen.

So weit, so unspektakulär.

""Das ist typisch bei denen. Die Schwarzen denken, hier ist alles umsonst""

Plötzlich kam es zu einer Unterbrechung. Ein dunkelhäutiges Paar mit Kinderwagen hatte offensichtlich keine Fahrkarte dabei. Beide sprachen kein Deutsch, waren sich aber augenscheinlich bewusst, um was es ging.

Die Frau schien verunsichert, dem Mann war es wohl einfach nur sehr peinlich.

Die Bayern sind für ihre grantige Art bekannt und der Kontrolleur, der keine Anstalten machte, es auch auf Englisch zu versuchen, war hier keine Ausnahme. Er war nicht beleidigend, hatte aber diese typisch ruppige Art, die man entweder liebt oder eben nicht.

Der Kontrolleur wollte den Ausweis sehen, der Mann verstand nicht und hielt sein geöffnetes Portemonnaie hin. Vielleicht dachte er, man könne im Zug nachzahlen, oder er wollte direkt die Strafe zahlen, vielleicht auch etwas ganz Anderes - das kann ich nicht genau sagen, denn meine Aufmerksamkeit wurde unterbrochen.

""Das ist typisch bei denen. Die Schwarzen denken, hier ist alles umsonst - aber das stimmt nicht.""

Dieser Satz kam von dem älteren Mann, der gegenüber in meinem Vierersitz saß. Er sagte das zu niemandem im Besonderen, aber in diesem speziellen Ton, der zeigt, dass ihn alle in der Bahn hören sollten. Auch der Kontrolleur und der schwarze Mann.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An die Neonazis neben mir in der U-Bahn

Ich weiß nicht, was es war. War es Peinlichkeit? Oder war es Angst? Schwer zu sagen. Auf jeden Fall war ich baff.

Der Mann ist in einem ganz gut besuchten U-Bahn-Abteil, umringt von Menschen, in einer der reichsten Städte Deutschlands, und hat keinerlei Vorbehalte, seine rassistischen Pauschalaussagen laut auszusprechen.

Er legte sogar noch nach.

""Natürlich mit Kind. Die vermehren sich rasant. Und das gibt auch mehr Mitleid.""

Die Bahn hielt, die Tür öffnete sich, der Kontrolleur und die Familie stieg aus, um die Sache weiter außerhalb des Zugs zu klären und wir fuhren wieder los.

Die Situation war vorbei, der Mann hatte seinen Teil gesagt und alle, inklusive mir, haben geschwiegen.

Ich weiß genau, was mein Schweigen anrichtete

Ich saß noch zwei weitere Stationen dem Mann gegenüber, habe starr aus dem Fenster in die Dunkelheit der U-Bahn-Schächte geschaut, bis ich ausgestiegen bin.

Mit schnellen Schritten ging ich nach Hause, klappte meinen Laptop auf und startete die erstbeste Serie auf Netflix. Schnell den Kopf mit irgendwelchen belanglosen Kram füllen, um nicht darüber nachzudenken, was eigentlich gerade passiert war.

Das hat für den ersten Moment auch funktioniert, aber nicht dauerhaft. Denn ich weiß genau, was mein Schweigen anrichtete.

Ein offensichtlicher Rassist hat in einer Gruppe von ca. 60 Mitfahrern seinen Hass verbreitet. Den Grund für seine Haltung kennen ich nicht. Vielleicht hat er schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht, vielleicht fällt er auf rechte Medien rein, vielleicht ist er so erzogen worden. Das weiß ich alles nicht, was ich aber sicher weiß, ist das mein Schweigen ihn in seiner Sicht bestätigt.

Niemand hat ihm widersprochen. Er hat laut seine Meinung gesagt und 60 Menschen haben kein Widerwort gegeben.

In seinem Kopf ist klar, was das bedeutet. Wenn er Unrecht gehabt hätte, hätte ihm doch wer widersprochen. Hat aber niemand, also müssen ja alle seiner Meinung sein.

Ich wollte mutig sein, aber habe versagt

Wenn ich auf Facebook Kommentare lese, wie ""die meisten Deutschen wachen ja jetzt auf"", ""die Mehrheit der Deutschen ist gegen die ausländischen Besatzer"" oder Klassiker wie ""wir sind das Volk"", ""wir sind Bürger, keine Nazis"", dann kommt das genau von solchen Situationen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich bin dunkelhäutig und Deutsche - trotzdem werde ich oft wie eine Fremde behandelt

Der Mann glaubt jetzt, dass die meisten Leute so denken wir er.

Auch wundert es nicht, wenn die Rechten in den Medien und sozialen Netzwerken so stark vertreten sind.

Natürlich schreiben die Nachrichtenseiten öfters über den neuen Hass-Tweet von irgendeinem AfD-Politiker als über die tolle Antwort der Nazi-Gegner. Denn viel zu selten kommt eine Antwort.

Ich mache mir keine Illusionen. Die politische Lage in Deutschland hätte sich nicht verändert, wenn ich etwas gesagt hätte. Wahrscheinlich hätte ich nicht mal den Mann in der U-Bahn umstimmen können.

Es hätte aber ein Zeichen sein können. An den Mann, dass nicht alle seiner Meinung sind und an alle in der Bahn, wie einfach es ist, ""Nein"" zu sagen.

Nein.

Früher habe ich laut Konstantin Weckers ""Sage Nein!"" gesungen.

""Ob du sechs bist oder hundert,

sei nicht nur erschreckt, verwundert,

tobe, zürne, misch dich ein

sage nein!""

Ich habe mir vor einiger Zeit vorgenommen, mutiger zu sein. Als die Chance sich bot, habe ich versagt. Das macht mich nicht zu einem schlechten Menschen, aber sicher auch nicht zu einem guten.

Aujourd'hui, les mentalités et les accusations qui se multiplient pourraient bien faire pencher la balance.","SOCIÉTÉ - ""Il est temps d'en finir avec la culture du viol qui produit un discours qui vise à minimiser, à excuser et à perpétuer les violences sexuelles. D'en finir, aussi, avec l'impunité des hommes célèbres qui violent, agressent, harcèlent et tuent des femmes et des enfants sans que cela ne gêne leur carrière"", peut-on lire dans la pétition lancée le 25 octobre par la féministe Laure Salmona.

Le but de cette pétition n'était autre qu'annuler la rétrospective de la Cinémathèque française consacrée à Polanski. Une demande que le musée a refusé très clairement dans un communiqué. ""Fidèle à ses valeurs et à sa tradition d'indépendance, La Cinémathèque n'entend se substituer à aucune justice. Son rôle de Musée du cinéma ne consiste pas à placer qui que ce soit sur un quelconque 'piédestal' moral. Ceux qui nous reprochent cela ne mettent jamais les pieds dans nos salles et ignorent tout de nos missions de conservation et transmission"", écrit l'institution, répondant ainsi à la pétition publiée le même jour.

En plein déluge de témoignages contre les harceleurs sexuels, l'exposition ne pouvait pas échapper aux militants. Le regard plutôt compatissant que la plupart des Français a longtemps porté sur le réalisateur Roman Polanski est-il en train de devenir noir? Si la France, à l'image de la Suisse ou de la Pologne, a accueilli celui qui a fui les États-Unis en 1978, elle pourrait aujourd'hui être le lieu d'un procès public.

Cette colère que certaines personnes éprouvent envers Roman Polanski est due à un épisode de sa vie qui remonte aux années 70. En 1977, après une séance photo en Californie, Roman Polanski, alors âgé de 43 ans, a été poursuivi pour avoir violé Samantha Geimer, 13 ans. Après 42 jours de prison, puis sa libération sous caution, le cinéaste a plaidé coupable de ""rapports sexuels illégaux"" avec une mineure. Avant l'annonce du verdict, craignant d'être lourdement condamné (ndlr: il risquait jusqu'à 50 ans de prison), il a choisi de fuir les États-Unis.

Depuis, le cinéaste, qui a épousé Emmanuelle Seigner en 1989, a réalisé ses plus beaux films. En avance sur les techniques de son époque, Roman Polanski est l'un des plus grands réalisateurs du XXe siècle. Ses oeuvres lui ont valu les honneurs du monde du cinéma. César, Oscars, Palme d'Or... Le cinéaste a reçu les plus belles récompenses du 7ème art. Chinatown, Tess, Rosemary's baby sans oublier Le Pianiste ont fait de lui un artiste admiré.

Mais aujourd'hui son talent irréfutable ne suffit plus à ""mettre de côté"" son passé. À l'heure où les langues se délient sur Internet mais aussi dans la rue, comme dimanche 29 octobre lors du rassemblement #MeToo à Paris, à l'heure où la Une des Inrockuptibles sur Bertrand Cantat indigne nombre de Français et notamment des artistes et des membres du gouvernement à l'image de Marlène Schiappa, la secrétaire d'État chargée de l'Égalité entre les femmes et les hommes, à l'heure où des dizaines de femmes prennent leur courage à deux mains et accusent Harvey Weinstein, producteur hollywoodien ultra-puissant, de viol, d'harcèlement ou d'agression sexuels, il se pourrait bien que le statut d'artiste ou d'homme de pouvoir ne suffise plus à faire taire la révolte.

Pourtant, l'histoire de Roman Polanski ne date pas d'hier, et pendant de nombreuses années les médias ne se sont pas tant préoccupés de son passé, ou plutôt si, mais pas de celui-ci. ""Roman Polanski, le survivant"" titrait un article du magazine Fémina en septembre 2002 en référence à son enfance dans le ghetto de Cracovie et à l'assassinat en 1969 de sa femme Sharon Tate, enceinte de huit mois, par Charles Manson et ses fidèles. À l'époque l'agression sexuelle est évoquée en une ligne et le journal s'interroge: ""coup monté?"".

Lors de la sortie du Pianiste en 2002, Roman Polanski est porté aux nues, même aux États-Unis où le cinéaste a droit, malgré son absence, à une standing ovation en recevant son Oscar du meilleur réalisateur. Dans la salle, certains visages sont perplexes mais la majorité de l'assemblée se lève, suivant l'exemple de Martin Scorsese et de Meryl Streep.

Aujourd'hui, le réalisateur de La Vénus à la fourrure est largement montré du doigt pour le détournement de mineur pour lequel il a plaidé coupable en 1973. ""J'en ai marre. Ce n'est pas agréable. Ras-le-bol"", expliquait-il à Léa Salamé en octobre 2016 à propos de l'image de violeur à laquelle les journalistes le renvoient sans cesse. Pourtant de nombreuses personnalités, notamment celles qui évoluent dans le milieu du cinéma, le défendent.

En janvier dernier, sa nomination à la présidence des César était loin de faire l'unanimité. Des associations féministes, des milliers d'internautes et même la ministre des Droits des femmes de l'époque Laurence Rossignol s'en sont insurgés. Face à la polémique, le réalisateur franco-polonais a renoncé à cet honneur. Pourtant, plus de 26 ans plus tôt, en 1991, Roman Polanski a été à la tête du jury du festival de Cannes sans que l'on crie au scandale. Les temps changent.

Mais il peut toujours compter en France sur de nombreux artistes qui, semble-t-il, le défendront toujours. Lors de la polémique des César, ils ont été nombreux à prendre sa défense. Parmi eux, Catherine Deneuve, ou encore le producteur Dominique Besnehard qui estime qu'il s'agit d'un ""débat périmé"". George Clooney, lui, trouve ""effrayant d'imaginer qu'on soit encore après lui"" alors que le cinéaste est aujourd'hui âgé de 83 ans.

""Dans cette période qui est très inflammable, où tout d'un coup les réseaux sociaux, des gens, dont on sait pas trop d'où ça sort, etc, qui exigent des choses, arrivent à vous dégommer Roman Polanski (...) Je ne lui pardonne pas comme je ne l'accable pas, je ne sais pas trop ce qui s'est passé. Je sais juste qu'en quarante ans, on ne lui a jamais rien dit"", confiait au sujet du cinéaste l'acteur et amoureux d'histoire Lorant Deutsch, invité sur le plateau de ""Thé ou Café"" en février dernier.

​​​​​

""Personne ne veut dire du mal de Polanski parce qu'il est une icône et que tous les acteurs rêvent de tourner avec lui"", assurait un professionnel du cinéma au Parisien lors de la polémique des César. ""Si un comédien le critique, il va passer pour un traître dans le milieu"", expliquait le représentant de plusieurs acteurs importants au quotidien français.

Mais certains osent. Lors des Molières, en février, Blanche Gardin a attaqué frontalement, mais sans citer de noms, le réalisateur de Chinatown en racontant une histoire de son enfance. ""J'adorais être sur scène avec mes petits camarades, surtout parce que pendant qu'on était sur scène le metteur en scène pouvait pas nous toucher. C'était un metteur en scène génial par ailleurs, hein, il faut savoir séparer l'homme de l'artiste.C'est bizarre que cette indulgence s'applique seulement aux artistes. On dit pas, par exemple, d'un boulanger: 'c'est vrai, il viole un peu des gosses dans le fournil, mais il fait quand même une baguette extraordinaire'"".

Aujourd'hui, de nombreuses personnes influentes souhaitent que ""la parole se libère"", comme le dit Françoise Nyssen, ministre de la Culture.

La société des réalisateurs de films, donc Jacques Audiard fait notamment partie, semble elle aussi changer de cap après l'affaire Weinstein. Elle qui ne s'était pas exprimée jusqu'alors a jugé qu'elle se devait de faire un communiqué pour clarifier sa position. ""En tant que réalisateurs, nous sommes dans une position qui nous engage. Nous en sommes conscients. Nous vivons les symptômes d'un écosystème encore trop inégalitaire, fortement hiérarchisé, qui concerne l'industrie toute entière. Abus de pouvoir, centralisation du pouvoir dans les mains des mêmes, dérives sexuelles s'appuyant sur la part affective à l'œuvre dans le processus de fabrication des films, font de l'industrie du cinéma, qui est loin d'être la seule concernée, une vitrine éloquente de ces abus. [...] Un vent de changement est en train de souffler, c'est notre responsabilité collective d'y prendre part"", peut-on lire sur le communiqué.

Le vent tourne mais l'image de Roman Polanski est complexe car il est à la fois victime et bourreau. Victime par son enfance et le drame familial vécu plusieurs dizaines d'années plus tard, bourreau par le viol qu'il a affligé à une enfant un après-midi de 1973. Aujourd'hui, les mentalités et les accusations qui se multiplient pourraient bien faire pencher la balance.

So, how did Melania Trump learn about the campaign?
Stephanie Grisham, spokeswoman for Melania TrumpMore than eight months into the Trump administration, it’s anyone’s guess what that platform might look like.
On Nov. 3, 2016, Melania Trump gave a speech in which she promised that, as first lady, she would work to combat cyberbullying, particularly against kids.
Grisham said the spouses had donated to PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center, a group that provides resources to students, parents and educators to combat bullying.","WASHINGTON ― Last week, first lady Melania Trump went to a middle school in a Detroit suburb to promote #NoOneEatsAlone — an initiative that encourages kids to include new peers at lunch. It was a nice event that attracted all sorts of warm attention from the media and only a small protest.

It was also a little unexpected: The nonprofit that created the campaign learned about the visit along with everyone else.

“We were very surprised to see our hashtag being promoted by the First Lady’s office,” said Laura Talmus, executive director of Beyond Differences, which designed the No One Eats Alone program. Talmus co-founded the organization with her husband, who happens to have served as state director for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential primary campaign in California, Texas and North Carolina.

Still, Talmus welcomes the opportunity to work with anyone who is “serious about making a difference among middle-school children.” That means “every day of the year, not just once,” she added.

So, how did Melania Trump learn about the campaign? “Doing research for her initiatives,” explained Stephanie Grisham, her spokeswoman, in an email to HuffPost. “She knew the school participated in such a program and wanted to make the visit in order to learn more and also shine a light on the importance of kindness and inclusion.”

News outlets were quick to suggest that Trump’s school visit is a sign that her plan to combat cyberbullying is, at long last, steaming ahead. (“Melania resumes doomed effort to curb her husband’s favorite pastime,” is how Vanity Fair put it in a headline.)

But that is not exactly the case. The first lady has “visited many schools,” Grisham said, “so the visit in Michigan should in no way be characterized as a ‘bullying prevention campaign.’”

As for the anti-bullying initiative itself, nothing has been announced yet, according to Grisham. “We are not discussing these kinds of details at this time,” she replied to a question about whether the first lady’s office plans to follow up with Beyond Differences about No One Eats Alone. But, she added, the office looks “forward to announcing her formal platform in the coming months.”

We are not discussing these kinds of details at this time, but look forward to announcing her formal platform in the coming months. Stephanie Grisham, spokeswoman for Melania Trump

More than eight months into the Trump administration, it’s anyone’s guess what that platform might look like. For context, former first lady Michelle Obama announced she was going to plant a vegetable garden in order to educate children about health in March 2009, a couple months after her husband’s inauguration. Not long after, she invited students to the White House to draw attention to the issue. However, she did not officially launch her signature “Let’s Move” campaign, combating childhood obesity, until February 2010.

On Nov. 3, 2016, Melania Trump gave a speech in which she promised that, as first lady, she would work to combat cyberbullying, particularly against kids. The pledge received some skepticism, given her husband’s penchant for attacking his foes on Twitter using choice epithets like “dummy dope,” “clown,” “psycho,” “dumb as a rock,” “a neurotic dope” and “disgusting (check out sex tape and past).”

Lady Gaga, who co-founded the Born This Way Foundation, which aims to empower youth, responded to the first lady’s speech by saying, “Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed.”

Still, Melania Trump is an “independent woman,” Grisham said, and bullying prevention experts are pleased that she plans to tackle the issue. But so far, groups that would like to lend ideas to the initiative say they still have not heard back.

In April, the first lady was honored at a luncheon for spouses of U.S. senators. Grisham said the spouses had donated to PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center, a group that provides resources to students, parents and educators to combat bullying.

“I sent a letter back to [Trump] thanking her for being involved in this issue,” said Paula Goldberg, the executive director of PACER Center. She wasn’t aware of any follow-up, but noted she has had substantial contact with the office of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. (The first lady and DeVos visited the Michigan school together.)

When HuffPost asked whether the first lady has followed up with PACER, Grisham said, again, “We are not discussing these kinds of details at this time, but look forward to announcing her formal platform in the coming months.”

In September, the first lady hosted a luncheon, this time at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, where she focused on a number of issues. “Whether it is drug addiction, bullying, poverty, disease, trafficking, illiteracy or hunger, it is the children who are hit first and hardest in any country,” she said.

Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, which provides information about cyberbullying among adolescents, said the first lady had not reached out to him or his group, though he added that “we’d be happy to work with her.”

“I think it’s important to connect with youth and be visible, and so I applaud the First Lady for doing that with her visit to the school in Michigan. It absolutely has symbolic value,” Hinduja wrote in an email.

He added, “I am sure she (and others) would agree that much more needs to be done on a substantive level. I trust that will be built into her overarching plan.”

Nine people work for the first lady, about half than the number who worked for her predecessors, according to The New York Times. The paper reported last week that she had not yet hired a director of policy.

“Melania is off to a good start,” said Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, founder and president of Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development. She would like to see the first lady convene a series of interdisciplinary workshops on cyberbullying, and pointed out that her organization has particular expertise on leading these kinds of workshops. Though Hurst-Della Pietra said she has reached out several times to the first lady, she said she has not yet received a response.

Asked which experts the first lady’s office has reached out to about bullying prevention, Grisham repeated her response to the other queries: “We are not discussing these kinds of details at this time, but look forward to announcing her formal platform in the coming months.”

She also declined to elaborate on what steps had been taken as part of the bullying prevention campaign. “Again,” she said, “there has been no formal announcement of anything yet.” The first lady “will continue to lend her voice and support to many different issues that have an impact on the well-being of children,” she added.

Talmus, of the No One Eats Alone program, pointed out that many children “are having feelings of anxiety around being different,” listing Muslim and LGBTQ youth as examples. Solving that is “not just a one-day event, it’s a value; it’s something that needs to be transmitted to children who are feeling especially fearful today because of all the rhetoric and hate,” she said.

Plenty of anti-bullying organizations would love to work with the first lady on her platform. When asked how her office will decide which organizations to work with, Grisham said, for a fourth time, “We are not discussing these kinds of details at this time, but look forward to announcing her formal platform in the coming months.”",Melania Trump’s Bullying Prevention Plans Are Still Mysterious,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-bullying-prevention-plans-mysterious_us_59f76ae4e4b09b5c2567f69c?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Pourtant, celui qui a honoré sa première sélection sans jouer face à la Serbie, réalise une très belle saison.","TENNIS - Le Master 1000 de Paris Bercy est toujours un rendez-vous spécial pour les Français. Mais cette édition 2017, qui s'ouvre lundi 30 octobre, pourrait bien se transformer en juge de paix entre les nombreux tricolores qui postulent à une sélection pour la finale de la Coupe Davis à Lille moins d'un mois plus tard, le week-end du 24 au 26 novembre.

Pendant une semaine, le capitaine de l'équipe de France Yannick Noah ainsi que ses adjoints Loïc Courteau et Cédric Pioline scruteront tous les faits et gestes des joueurs susceptibles de prendre part à l'aventure. Si trois joueurs, devenus piliers de l'équipe, sont presque certains d'être de la partie, il reste cependant deux places à prendre... et toutes les options semblent ouvertes. Surtout depuis que Gaël Monfils a annoncé mettre fin à sa saison.

Malgré une campagne globalement maîtrisée, Yannick Noah n'a pas de certitude quand à la composition de son groupe. En trois rencontres, il a convoqué pas moins de huit joueurs différents, une première dans l'histoire du tennis tricolore. Le tournoi de Paris Bercy, qui se déroule sur dur et en indoor comme la finale de la Coupe Davis au stade Pierre Mauroy de Lille, devrait donc permettre au capitaine de trancher entre cinq à six prétendants.

Ils sont -presque- certains d'en être

Nicolas Mahut et Pierre-Hugues Herbert, ici le 16 Septembre 2017, sont devenus des piliers de l'équipe de France de Coupe Davis

Yannick Noah ne devrait pas se passer d'un de ses meilleurs atouts: la paire Nicolas Mahut / Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Le double tricolore, sixième au classement ATP Race, est une des références du circuit mondial. Fiables, ils ont remporté trois de leurs quatre matchs en Coupe Davis, avec comme dernière victoire en date une démonstration trois sets à zéro face au double serbe en demi finale. De surcroît, le duo connaît très bien la surface de jeu qui leur sera proposée à Lille. Ils ont remporté six de leurs onze titres communs sur dur, dont quatre Masters 1000 et un US Open.

Jo Wilfried Tsonga devrait également être de la partie et endosser -une nouvelles fois- la tunique de leader. Présent dans cette équipe de France depuis 2008, le Manceau ne voulait pas participer à cette édition 2017, avant de revenir sur sa décision. De retour pour la demi finale face à la Serbie, Tsonga avait fait parler sa puissance et apporté deux points à l'équipe. La rencontre face à la Belgique fin novembre semble désormais être l'objectif ultime d'une saison marquée par des pépins physiques, une paternité... et quatre titres, son record. Classé 15e à l'ATP, le numéro 1 français pourra répéter ses gammes à Paris Bercy, un tournoi qu'il connaît bien pour l'avoir remporté en 2008.

Richard Gasquet, le revenant

Et revoilà Richard Gasquet. Après une saison délicate jalonnée par les blessures à répétition, le Biterrois revient au meilleur des moments. Une tournée asiatique plutôt prometteuse, avec deux quarts de finale bonifiées par une très belle victoire face à l'Autrichien Dominic Thiem, 6e au classement ATP, chez lui à Vienne. La meilleure performance de sa saison. À 31 ans, il fait partie, avec Gilles Simon, Jo Wilfried Tsonga, et Gaël Monfils des Français régulièrement appelés ces dernières années en Coupe Davis. Il lui reste désormais une semaine parisienne pour prouver à Yannick Noah qu'il mérite une nouvelle fois sa place pour aller chercher ce qui serait le plus beau titre de sa carrière.

Lucas Pouille, l'avenir

Lucas Pouille, deuxième meilleur Français au classement ATP derrière l'indéboulonnable Jo Wilfired Tsonga, a toutes les chances de faire partie de l'aventure à Lille. Aligné en simple lors des quarts et demi finales des éditions 2016 et 2017, le nordiste de 23 ans est dans les petits papiers du capitaine Yannick Noah, qui voit en lui un joueur capable de faire progresser la génération Tsonga-Monfils-Gasquet confortablement installée depuis plusieurs années. ""C'est l'espoir du tennis français. Il est même vraiment en avance sur les prévisions. J'espère qu'il va non seulement continuer à avancer, mais aussi pousser tous les autres à aller de l'avant"", explique-t-il. Un bon parcours à Bercy permettrait à Lucas Pouille de chasser les quelques doutes qui ont pu naître dans l'esprit des sceptiques après sa contre performance face au modeste joueur Dusan Lajovic en demi finale.

Gilles Simon, l'oublié

Gilles Simon traverse une saison 2017 -très- compliquée. Tombé de la 25e à la 74e place au classement ATP, le Français s'est incliné à treize reprises lors de son entrée en lice dans un tournoi. Séparé de son entraîneur Jan De Witt depuis le 2 octobre, Gilles Simon semble retrouver un peu d'allant. Il a notamment atteint son premier huitième de finale en Masters 1000 de la saison à Shangai en écartant le dixième joueur mondial... David Goffin. Le leader de l'équipe belge que les Bleus affronteront à Lille. Un beau parcours à Paris pourrait-il pousser le capitaine à changer ses plans? Possible, surtout s'il prend en compte l'expérience des prétendants dans ces rencontres internationales.

Benoît Paire, le blacklisté

""C'est très simple, pour répondre en toute franchise sur la Coupe Davis, c'est quelque chose qui me fait rêver. J'ai toujours rêvé de jouer la Coupe Davis pour l'équipe de France."" Benoît Paire le sait, sa déclaration d'amour à de grande chance de rester lettre morte: ""j'en suis très très loin, il ne faut pas s'en cacher. Je n'ai aucun contact avec le staff de l'équipe de France, aucune nouvelle"", explique-t-il, fataliste. Il faut dire que le Français, longtemps considéré comme la relève du tennis tricolore est désormais plus connu pour son mauvais caractère que son revers lumineux. On se souvient notamment de son exclusion du club France lors des Jeux olympiques de Rio. Et même si l'Avignonnais, 40e mondial au classement ATP, semble décidé à abandonner son statut d'enfant terrible du tennis français, Yannick Noah ne devrait pas lui faire honorer sa première sélection lors d'une finale.

Adrian Mannarino, pourquoi pas?

Sur le papier, c'est lui qui devrait être le cinquième mousquetaire. Troisième Français au classement ATP derrière Jo Wilfried Tsonga et Lucas Pouilles, Adrian Mannarino ne jouit pas de la même renommée médiatique que ses compatriotes. Pourtant, celui qui a honoré sa première sélection sans jouer face à la Serbie, réalise une très belle saison. Après avoir atteint ses premiers huitièmes de finale (à Wimbledon), le Français a disputé deux finales de tournois ATP. Un bon parcours à Bercy, sur une surface qu'il affectionne au même titre que le gazon, pourrait lui apporter une certaine légitimité à faire partie de l'aventure lilloise.

Boudé par Novak Djokovic, Nick Kyrgios, Tomas Berdych, Stan Wawrinka, Milos Raonic, Andy Murray, Kei Nishikori et très probablement Roger Federer, le Masters 1000 de Paris offre le terrain de jeu idéal à un affrontement franco-français en vue d'une finale de Coupe Davis très attendue.",Le Masters 1000 de Paris Bercy ou la dernière chance des Français pour taper dans l’œil de Noah avant la finale de Coupe Davis,http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/10/29/le-masters-1000-de-paris-bercy-ou-la-derniere-chance-des-francais-pour-taper-dans-l-oeil-de-noah-avant-la-finale-de-coupe-davis_a_23255755/

In einer gemeinsamen Mitteilung berichteten die Verantwortlichen, sie hätten die Enthüllungen um Spacey am Montag mit den Schauspielern und der Filmcrew besprochen. Spacey sei nicht auf dem Filmset gewesen.

Die Entscheidung, die Serie einzustellen, sei allerdings schon vor Monaten gefallen, sagte eine Person, die mit der Situation vertraut sei, der Nachrichtenagentur AP.

Spacey outete sich als schwul

Schauspieler Anthony Rapp hatte Spacey in einem Interview eines sexuellen Übergriffs beschuldigt. Er selbst sei bei den Vorgängen 14 Jahre alt gewesen, Spacey schon 26.

Spacey habe ihn im Jahr 1986 nach einer Party in seinem New Yorker Apartment auf sein Bett gelegt und sei auf ihn gestiegen, sagte der heute 46-jährige Rapp dem Magazin ""Buzzfeed News"". Er habe sich aus der Umklammerung ""herauswinden"" können und die Wohnung verlassen. Auf Twitter antwortete Spacey, er könne sich an den Vorfall ""ehrlich nicht erinnern"".

Spacey nahm die Vorwürfe zum Anlass, sich als schwul zu outen. ""Ich habe mein ganzes Leben über Männer geliebt und romantische Begegnungen mit ihnen gehabt, und jetzt entscheide ich mich dafür, als schwuler Mann zu leben"", schrieb der Oscarpreisträger in der Nacht zu Montag auf Twitter.

After the wallop we took from Hurricane Harvey, Houston is bouncing back, in no small part due to the helping hands we extended to each other in the middle of a crisis. After being tossed around in past decades on an economic boom and bust rollercoaster, Houston has diversified its economics and become much less vulnerable to single-sector job upheaval. After playing second fiddle to the great cities of the United States and the world, the nation’s fourth largest city is now its most diverse and on the leading edge.

Houston is bouncing back, in no small part due to the helping hands we extended to each other in the middle of a crisis.

One of every four Houstonians was born in another country. We are a magnet for refugees, other immigrants, mom-and-pop entrepreneurs and job-seekers of every background. We are the future of America.

To get here, immigrants and other opportunity-seekers had to be resilient first. Often they had to reach out to each other for help. Fortunately they brought to Houston not only the spirit of hard work, but also a stunning array of traditions, cuisine, languages, religions and culture pursuits. We are a tolerant city that builds bridges, not walls. The new arrivals have become us and we have become them. Resiliency is our code.

HuffPost is hitting the road this fall to interview people about their hopes, dreams, fears ― and what it means to be American today.

As a relatively new city with a relatively young population, we are less set in our ways than other cities, less prone to stick with our own kind. This attitude opens up all kinds of opportunities for Houstonians old and new to explore what is truly means to support each other.

When the hurricane brought cataclysmic flooding to Houston, death and destruction were the first story lines coming out of our city. But the narrative was quickly replaced by brighter truths. Houstonians leaped to the task of rescuing each other, sheltering each other, comforting each other. We were seen accurately as a place where volunteers spring forward to meet the newest needs.

Houstonians leaped to the task of rescuing each other, sheltering each other, comforting each other.

We had practice. The nation watched in admiration in 2005 as Houston welcomed and resettled tens of thousands of evacuees from New Orleans after it was smashed by Hurricane Katrina. As we build new traditions in Houston, our ready volunteerism is a beacon.

The Port of Houston is one of the busiest on the globe. As the Energy Capital of the World, our expertise is in demand across hemispheres. With the Texas Medical Center, the largest of its kind, attracting patients from across the nation and abroad, Houston’s helping hands provide health care to wide spectrum of people.

최근 플로리다 탬파 지역에서 같은 날 세 명이 살해당하는 사건이 있었다. 경찰은 동일한 연쇄 살인범의 무작위 범죄로 보고 있다.

지난 목요일(26일) 플로리다 경찰은 이 사건과 관련한 '요주의 인물'이 감시 카메라에 잡힌 영상을 공개했다.

영상에선 후드가 달린 긴 재킷을 입은 인물이 휴대전화기를 손으로 튕기며 무심한 걸음으로 어딘가를 향해 걸어가고 있다.

이 영상이 촬영된 장소에서 지난 10월 9일 같은 시간에 첫 피해자인 22살의 벤저민 미첼이 살해당했다. 편집된 영상 1분 28초경부터 이 인물은 어딘가를 향해 달리기 시작하는데, 경찰의 설명에 따르면 걸어가는 장면과 뛰어가는 장면 사이에 미첼이 총에 맞았다.

경찰은 지난 목요일 영상의 인물이 남성이라고 언급한 바 있지만, 영상만으로는 성별이나 나이를 확인하기 어렵다.

이들은 서로를 알지 못했으며 강도를 당하지 않았고, 탬파 세미놀 하이츠 지역의 버스 정류장 인근 1마일 반경 안에서 총에 맞아 숨졌다.

JUSTICE - La réclusion criminelle à perpétuité a été requise à l'encontre d'Abdelkader Merah, lundi 30 octobre. Il comparaît devant la cour d'assises de Paris pour ""complicité"" dans les sept assassinats commis en 2012 par son frère Mohamed Merah à Toulouse et Montauban.

L'avocate générale Naïma Rudloff a demandé à la cour d'assortir cette condamnation d'une peine de sûreté de 22 ans.

Elle a par ailleurs réclamé 20 ans de réclusion criminelle assortie d'une peine de sûreté des deux tiers à l'encontre du deuxième accusé, Fettah Malki, un petit trafiquant de cité de 34 ans jugé pour ""association de malfaiteurs terroriste criminelle"".

La représentante du ministère public a en outre demandé à la cour l'inscription des deux condamnations au Fijait (Fichier judiciaire national automatisé des auteurs d'infractions terroristes).

Un procès sous haute tension

Entre le 11 et le 19 mars 2012, Mohamed Merah avait assassiné sept personnes, dont trois enfants, à Toulouse et Montauban, avant d'être abattu par la police.

Les qualifications reprochées à Abdelkader Merah se fondent sur son rôle supposé de ""mentor"" idéologique de son frère, sa participation au vol d'un scooter et à l'achat d'un blouson utilisés lors des attentats. Fettah Malki est, lui, poursuivi pour avoir fourni une arme et un gilet pare-balles au tueur. Mais, pour tenir, ces accusations supposent que les deux accusés connaissaient les projets du jihadiste, une démonstration qui n'a pas été faite formellement à l'audience.

L'exemplarité du premier des procès des attentats qui ont endeuillé la France depuis 2012 et l'attente des victimes et de l'opinion d'une réponse judiciaire ont d'emblée placé les débats sous haute tension. ""Ce qui se joue ici, c'est la capacité d'une justice démocratique à juger des terroristes sans sacrifier le droit"", a résumé Me Simon Cohen, avocat de victimes assassinées dans une école juive.

Le verdict de ce procès est attendu jeudi, après cinq semaines de débats éprouvants.

AfD ist weit von einer Regierungsbeteiligung entfernt

Dabei könnte die AfD nicht weiter von einer Regierungsbeteiligung entfernt sein als derzeit.

Erstens, weil keine Partei mit den Rechtspopulisten koalieren möchte. Es ist auch nicht abzusehen, dass sich das in den kommenden vier Jahren ändern sollte.

Zweitens, weil die AfD weit von der Stärke der Schwesterpartei in Österreich entfernt ist, die dort doppelt so stark ist und damit den Konservativen keine andere Wahl lässt, als sich auf sie einzulassen.

AfD ist bei diesem Thema heillos zerstritten

Und drittens, weil die AfD bei diesem Thema heillos zerstritten ist.

Soll die Partei in der Fundamentalopposition bleiben - oder sich fit machen für mögliche Koalitionen? Seit Monaten wird dieser Richtungsstreit erbittert geführt.

Auch die ausgeschiedene AfD-Chefin Petry strebte eine Regierungsbeteiligung der AfD an, scheiterte aber mit einem entsprechenden Antrag auf dem Parteitag in Köln. Diese Niederlage war der Anfang vom Ende ihrer Karriere in der Partei.

Petry scheiterte daran

Der rechte Flügel um die AfD-Landeschefs Björn Höcke und André Poggenburg sehen die Partei hingegen in der Fundamentalopposition. Sie lehnen jede Koalitionsvereinbarungen ab.

Will Weidel die AfD tatsächlich fit für mögliche Koalitionsgespräche machen, muss ihr gelingen, woran Petry scheiterte.

Living in an ashram on the banks of the Ganges in the foothills of the Himalayas it sometimes takes me an extra few days or even more to catch up with world events. With no television, the news is limited to that which I see on Google News or Huff Post while drinking a cup of tea in the morning, or what shows up in my Facebook feed when I open it about once a week.

It has, therefore, taken me this long to see the wave of #metoo rising in the West and slowly but surely causing crucial ripples here in the East. My life of 46 years has bridged not only the Western and Eastern hemispheres geographically but also Western and Eastern models of understanding and responding to ourselves and our world.

The tragic rape and subsequent death of a young woman in Delhi five years ago tore open the tightly sealed cultural box of sex crimes and sexual harassment in India, and out of it flew a newfound openness to discuss what had previously been taboo. ""Yes, it happens. and no, we don't talk about it"" was pretty much the modus operandi until Nirbhaya occupied the front page of newspapers and our collective conscience.

More and more organisations are now forming to drag this monster out of the closet of our collective denial and into the daylight of our collective awareness and action. Women's empowerment training programs in villages and cities are growing to provide not only sewing and handicrafts but also karate.

In fact, this is one of the reasons that our Global Interfaith WASH Alliance is working so ardently for the provision and use of toilets. When millions of girls and women in the rural villages don't have a toilet at home and have to go into fields and forests to heed the call of nature, they are easy prey for not only wild animals but also for men who act like wild animals. Toilets in their homes provide safety and security along with the obvious health and hygiene benefits.

Yes, social norms must be fiercely and courageously examined and, where necessary, rewritten.

Recently, I had the great honour of being on stage with Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi to address an auditorium of college students on the wide prevalence of sexual abuse and the necessity of addressing and preventing it. I could barely believe the words were coming out of my mouth in India, in public, with dignitaries on stage and a hall full of people. This is a program that could not and would not have taken place ten years ago as the issue was not being discussed in public fora. So there is some progress, but much is left to be done.

Me Too

I could share many #metoo experiences from the first 25 years of my life in America, ranging from those situations where I had the ability, physical strength and the presence of mind to prevent or stop it, to those situations where I did not. Suffice it to say, for the purposes of this article, that yes, I get it. Fully. Yes, it is rampant. Yes, it is outrageously unacceptable. Yes, action must be taken: legally, legislatively, professionally, academically, and culturally. Yes, social norms must be fiercely and courageously examined and, where necessary, rewritten.

While my first 25 years were steeped in the land, culture and social norms of the West, including its models and philosophies of psychology and healing, the last twenty-one years of my life have been spent immersed in the East, in a deeply traditional ashram in the foothills of the Himalayas.

You Are Not This Pen

Each morning in the universal prayers at five o'clock we chant, ""Sansaara ko swapnavat jaano."" The world is but a dream. ""Mahalon mein raakhe, chaahe jhopadi mein vasa de. Jaahi vidhi raakhe Raama, taahi vidhi rahiye. (Wherever God puts you, whether it's a mansion or a shack (literal and metaphoric), recognise that it is all Divine blessings and be grateful for them.)""

A sexual assault, verbal or physical, does not change the nature of my deepest, highest, most true Self. But it does impact my ability to experience my Self.

The teaching of Aham Brahmasmi, I am Brahma, I am God, all is God, there is nothing but God is a fundamental tenet of Vedantic teaching. Om Brahm, Om Brahm, we are taught to chant with each breath and each step: left, right, left, right, Om Brahm, Om Brahm. There is nothing but God. It is all God.

Within my first few weeks at the ashram, my Guru held up a pen in front of me and told me, ""You are not this pen."" I laughed in anticipation of a punch-line that surely was coming, as one giggles on the first ""knock, knock."" We may not know who's there yet, but we know it will be funny, and our laugh begins bubbling to the surface even before the punch-line is delivered. Obviously, I wasn't a pen. What else? What was the punch-line?

My Guru did not laugh, though. This was not a joke. He looked very deeply at me and said, ""Today you laugh because you know you are not a pen. But you still identify as the physical body and mind. You think you are your body, you think you are your emotions, you think you are your history and identity. But you are no more your body than you are this pen. Someday you will laugh the same way when I tell you are not your body as you do when I say you are not a pen."" Aham Brahmasmi, Om Brahm. It is all God. There is nothing but God. The rest is an illusion, we are taught.

The practice of Neti Neti is an ancient meditation technique to attain the experience of the supreme Self, the Supreme Soul. ""I am not my clothing,"" we begin. Okay, everyone agrees with that. Then, eyes closed, seated in meditation posture, we go deeper and deeper, silently at our own pace, in our own mind. ""I am not my skin beneath the clothes. I am not the blood flowing beneath my skin. I am not my organs."" We know this, of course, because when our skin peels, we do not experience any loss of the self. When we donate blood or receive a blood transfusion, we are neither losing nor gaining any aspect of our identity. I could donate an organ to you and, while that would be deeply generous, I would still be here and you would still be there. So ""I"" does not get transferred in the kidney.

Then, deeper. I am not my cells or the hormones or neurotransmitters released from them. I am not the electrical transmissions along the axons of my neurons. Therefore, I am not my emotions or my thoughts which are chemical, electrical patterns of energetic transmission in my brain. If I were my thoughts then I would cease to exist in those rare moments of thoughtlessness or between my thoughts. If I ceased to exist between my thoughts, who would think the next one?

So we practice this on and on until there is nothing left to discard. No layers are left of the onion of our self. In that space which the Buddhists tend to refer to as emptiness (shunya) and the Hindus tend to refer to as everything-ness (purna), I have an experience of the true Self, borderless, formless consciousness.

My Brain Too

And yet.

My experience of the Self comes to me through my brain. In order to peel the layers back, in order to go deeper and deeper, to extricate myself from the chains of my false identities, I need, ironically, my brain. It is my brain that processes the mantra, my brain that permits me to shut down some parts of it while activating others so I may have the experience of oneness with the world.

Just as our eyes are not the rainbow but are the medium through which we experience the rainbow, just as our ears are not the mantras but are the medium through which we hear the mantras, similarly, our brains are not ""I"" but are the medium through which we can experience ""I.""

Our brains are impacted by sexual assault

A lesion in my optic nerve will not render the rainbow any less beautiful, but it WILL impact my ability to see and enjoy the rainbow. An infection in my tympanic membrane will not impact the powerful alchemy of mantras being chanted by priests, but it WILL impact my ability to hear them and therefore my ability to be healed by them. A sexual assault, verbal or physical, does not change the nature of my deepest, highest, most true Self. But it does impact my ability to experience my Self. There is something about being violated in this way that cuts through to the very core of how we experience ourselves and therefore how we experience our Selves. Something gets forever shifted, a note in the symphony of Self gets forever tweaked.

It is an injury that doesn't heal like a black eye or broken nose. It is an injury to the very experience of who we are and how we process our existence on Earth.

Changing the Experience of Our Self

And yet.

In the West, we tend to glorify our issues. They become our identity. We have taken the statement required in 12-step meetings into our core consciousness. ""I am an alcoholic."" ""I am an addict."" ""I am bulimic."" ""I am a rape survivor."" The list of possible identities is nearly endless, and they are insidiously enticing. Bill W. instituted a practice of verbal admission to cut through the denial preventing us from overcoming addiction. It was not meant to become the very core of our identity.

If our experience happened more than seven or eight years ago, even if it was grossly physical and violated every inch of our bodies, inside and out, there is not one cell left to which it happened. Every cell of the body sloughs and regenerates. The skin is quickest at every few days. Some organs take seven or eight years. Rarely, though, is it our liver or spleen that was touched, grabbed, groped or penetrated. The parts of our bodies that were, if the inappropriate behaviour was physical, have long since sloughed off and been replaced.

Our bodies have healed, but our brains have not. It is in our brains, in the patterns of electrical, chemical and magnetic energy, that we store this pain and the identification with it.

We now know that our brains can be changed

What the rishis, sages, mystics and prophets of the world's religions have been telling us for thousands of years, scientists are ""discovering"" today. These patterns of thought and behaviour exist in two-way communication with how we think and act. Not only do our brains create/impact/direct what we think and do, but what we think and do creates/impacts/directs the neuronal patterns in our brain. Changing our behaviour, changing our breath, changing our thoughts, changing our beliefs, changes our brains. Changing our brains changes our experience of the self and the Self.

Meditation by survivors is not the solution to sexual misconduct. But it is, I have found, the bridge between knowing #metoo and living as #metoo.

For me, the pendulum between violated body and untouched soul has been a journey not of either/or, but of yes/and.

Yes, we must join together and do everything we can to hold this in the light of our collective, cultural awareness and insist that laws, rules and norms all change. And, through our spiritual practice, we can live with the experiential awareness that, yes #metoo and yes, the ""me"" to whom it happened, is not the deepest, highest, truest experience of I.

Yes, #metoo, and yes, Aham Brahmasmi

I am so pleased to announce ""Listen to America,"" a hugely ambitious, cross-country project we’re undertaking at HuffPost to understand what’s on the minds of Americans and what it means to be American in 2017. Consider this an invitation to our journey.

For journalists, listening is more important than ever. Why? First, trust in the news media is at an all-time low. We want to address that head-on, and build trust in the work we do, by visiting communities that are often ignored by national media. We’ll listen to what’s most important to them, and help tell those stories to the vast HuffPost audience.

Second, political divisions between us seem starker than ever. But at HuffPost, we believe there’s still so much that unites us as citizens. We aim to discover and highlight all that, and show what Americans have in common. As we visit 25 cities, we’ll use our bus — built out as a mobile video studio — to listen and collect hundreds if not thousands of voices, and we’ll share many of them along the way. We’ll also create ways for you to make your voice heard too, even if we aren’t coming to your hometown.

Third, as journalists, being good listeners, and getting out of our own way, are at the core of our practice. ""Listen to America"" is an opportunity to practice this skill over and over, and discover great stories out in the field, where they live.

Quinto posted a statement on Twitter Monday criticizing Spacey for coming out in response to allegations made against him by Rapp. In an interview with BuzzFeed, Rapp accused Spacey ― who he met while they were both acting on Broadway ― of sexually harassing him at a party in 1986 when he was just 14 years old and Spacey was 26.

“It is deeply sad and troubling that this is how Kevin Spacey has chosen to come out,” the “Star Trek” film actor, who came out publicly in 2011, wrote. “Not by standing up as a point of pride - in the light of all his many awards and accomplishments thus inspiring tens of thousands of struggling LGBTQ kids around the world [-] but as a calculated manipulation to deflect attention from the very serious accusation that he attempted to molest one.”

Early Monday, Spacey released a statement, saying it was “inappropriate drunken behavior” and that the story “encouraged” him to “address other things about my life,” namely his same-sex relationships.

Other celebrities spoke out against Spacey for attempting to now use a “PR smokescreen” to draw attention away from Rapp’s claims. GLAAD said the focus should be solely on the alleged victim.

“Coming-out stories should not be used to deflect from allegations of sexual assault,” Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “This is not a coming-out story about Kevin Spacey, but a story of survivorship by Anthony Rapp and all those who bravely speak out against unwanted sexual advances. The media and public should not gloss over that.”

Rapp is speaking out as part of a larger movement to call out abusers in positions of power.

BBc

The facts and figures involved in making the highly-anticipated follow-up to ‘Blue Planet’ are mind-boggling, and the stories the crew has recounted are almost as unbelievable as the discoveries they’ve made. Prepare to have your mind blown... 1. It took four years to film and produce That’s a whole presidential term. 2. The logistics involved are colossal The team mounted 125 expeditions in 39 countries, on every continent, across every ocean. That’s a whole lot of time spent underwater. 3. 6,000 hours to be precise The crew filmed everywhere from familiar shores to the deepest seas.

BBC

4. They went deep So deep in fact, that the crew uncovered many discoveries new to science. 5. They filmed a sea within a sea The crew captured a sequence of eels diving in and out of an underwater lake. 6. The crew had lots of new toys to play with New technology used in the new series includes bubble-less diving equipment that allows the cameramen to swim underneath whales, and light-detection cameras that can capture phosphorescent rays.

BBC

7. Some of the creatures caught on camera are straight out of ‘Star Wars’ These include leaping blennies - fish that live almost exclusively on land - and giant trevally that snatch seabirds out of mid-air. 8. The crew spent 1,000 hours in submersibles All in order to film the ocean’s final frontier - Earth’s ‘inner space’ - the deep. 9. That’s 1,000 metres under the sea And the maximum depth current technology can go.

BBC

10. No one can go to the loo whilst in the deep So they have to hold it for 10 hours. IN WATER. 11. We still know relatively little about life in our oceans It’s said we know less about the depths of our own planet than we do the surface of Mars. 12. Only three humans have ever gone deeper underwater than the ‘Blue Planet II’ crew They are two guys in the 1960′s, Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard, and more recently ‘Titanic’ and ‘Avatar’ director James Cameron.

BBC

13. There were some seriously hairy moments Producer Orla Doherty recounts a particularly scary incident that took place as they filmed in the deep. She explains: “We noticed water gathering in the bottom [of the sub]. We were 450 metres deep, so it was 45 minutes back up to the surface. All sorts of things go through your mind – there’s a giant crack and it’s just going to go. There isn’t a way out. There’s no happy ending. “It took 20 minutes to figure out where the water was coming from, and how to stop it getting in. That was an exciting 20 minutes. The pilot noticed one of the inlets on a pressure gauge wasn’t quite watertight. So it was a seep, not a crack or hole that could rupture, and it was just a case of sealing it off. “The pilot asked if I wanted to go straight back to the surface now and I said ‘No, let’s stay down and get on with our day’s work!’ Every single dive into the deep is a precious thing.” 14. Never underestimate an ocean-dwelling creature. In the opening episode, a little tuskfish picks up a clam in its mouth and proceeds to smash it open on a special clam-opening divot that it has found in a piece of coral. In other words, it uses a tool. 15. Whales and dolphins have an annual get-together One sequence captures the moment an enormous pod of false killer whales come upon a similarly enormous pod of bottlenose dolphins, and have a good old catch-up. They speak in dolphin language, hang out and catch fish. Apparently they do this every year.

""Algunas veces la autoestima de la gente es baja porque tuvieron una niñez en la que no fueron valorados"", dice.

Existen acciones que puedes tomar para fortalecer tu autoestima y encontrar el buen camino.","En lo referente a la salud mental siempre es importante tener una autoestima sana. Obviamente no es buena idea tener el tipo de amor que Kanye reserva para Kanye, pero tener una visión positiva de ti mismo o de lo que contribuyes es un buen punto para estar.

De hecho, según la psicóloga clínica y directora de Armchair Psychology, Amanda Gordon, tener una autoestima sana es la clave para tomar decisiones e interactuar con la sociedad.

""La autoestima se trata de sentirse bien con respecto a uno mismo. De tratarse con respeto"", Gordon dijo al HuffPost Australia. ""Implica conocimiento de uno mismo y del valor que se tiene de uno"".

""La autoestima se trata de sentirte suficientemente bien para depender únicamente de tus opiniones y juicios"".

Sin embargo, no todos resultan bendecidos con esto. Los síntomas de una autoestima baja incluyen el odio o el disgusto por uno mismo, sentir que uno no vale nada, culparse por cosas que no son culpa de uno, incapacidad para reconocer fortalezas e indecisiones.

""La gente con baja autoestima tiende a seguir a la manada"", dice Gordon. ""No cree en su propia opinión"".

""Si no tienes autoestima no te respetas a ti mismo, no te valoras. Y lo que acaba por suceder es que dejas tu propia felicidad para el último"".

Según Gordon, las razones detrás de tu baja autoestima pueden variar, y puede deberse a circunstancias pasadas o actuales.

""Algunas veces la autoestima de la gente es baja porque tuvieron una niñez en la que no fueron valorados"", dice. ""O momentos en sus vidas en las que no fueron valorados"".

""En ocasiones tienes que regresar en el tiempo y reconsiderar lo que pasó en algún momento de tu vida"".

""En otras circunstancias, la gente se siente afectada por lo que le ha estado sucediendo en situaciones más recientes. Por ejemplo, tu autoestima puede dañarse si alguien te está molestando. O si por algún motivo no te va bien en el trabajo o en algo en lo que has estado trabajando mucho"".

Cualquiera que sea el motivo, afortunadamente no se trata de algo en lo que debas permanecer para siempre. Existen acciones que puedes tomar para fortalecer tu autoestima y encontrar el buen camino.

En primer lugar, mira alrededor y busca todas las cosas positivas que hay en tu mundo.

""Yo empezaría buscando las cosas buenas de mi vida"", dice Gordon. ""Pregúntate, si te ha pasado algo bueno hoy, qué te hace feliz de tu vida"".

Gordon también dice que las afirmaciones positivas pueden ayudar, siempre y cuando queden allí.

""Las afirmaciones son buenas pero necesitan un contexto"", dice. ""Es poco probable que sólo con eso se resuelva algo"".

De hecho, algunos psicólogos recomiendan evitarlas.

""Las afirmaciones positivas son como calorías vacías. Puedes decirte que eres grande pero si no lo crees tu mente negará la afirmación y terminarás por sentirte peor"", el psicólogo y escritor Guy Winch escribió para Psychology Today.

""Las afirmaciones sólo funcionan cuando caen dentro del rango de la credibilidad y para la gente con baja autoestima normalmente no funcionan.

Lo mejor que puedes hacer para arreglar tu autoestima es tomar un riesgo. Esto podría resultar contraproducente porque sería lo último que tiene ganas de hacer alguien con baja autoestima, pero Gordon dice que es importante perseverar.

""Creo que tomar un riesgo e intentar algo y sobrevivir es lo mejor que se puede hacer"", dice ella. ""Se trata de hacer algo que no tenga que ver con el éxito y sí con hacer algo"".

""Sal de ti mismo. Trata de hacer algo por los demás. Toma riesgos. Intenta algo nuevo.

""Se trata de medir el éxito de una manera diferente a cómo lo has hecho en el pasado"".

Finalmente, si no lo aguantas o eres incapaz de verte bajo una luz positiva, Gordon recomienda buscar ayuda profesional.

""Si crees que tu baja autoestima te detiene, si no tomas riesgos en tu carrera o no crees que eres lo suficientemente buena como para salir con alguien que te lo pidió, yo buscaría ayuda psicológica"", dice. ""Hay tantas cosas que podemos hacer para ayudarte. No quiere decir que tengas que estar en terapia para siempre. Pero puede ayudarte a tener un camino más fácil"":",¿Cómo fortalecer tu autoestima?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/10/30/como-fortalecer-tu-autoestima_a_23260086/

Diese Wahl ist ein Desaster. Bei den letzten drei Bundestagswahlen hat die SPD die drei schlechtesten Ergebnisse seit 1949 eingefahren. Der Vertrauensverlust ist enorm.

Von über 20 Millionen Wählern im Jahr 1998 sind 2013 ist nicht mal mehr die Hälfte übriggeblieben. Das kurze Aufflackern mit einem neuen Vorsitzenden, kurzfristig guten Umfragen und Parteieintritten kann nicht darüber hinwegtäuschen, dass sich sehr viele Menschen von der SPD abgewandt haben.

Nur die ganz Treuen sind geblieben - und diejenigen, welche die SPD als kleineres Übel gewählt haben.

Der Markenkern der SPD ist unter die Räder gekommen

Die SPD wurde von oben nach unten regiert und aus einer lebendigen, streitbaren Partei ist zu sehr ein Wahlverein geworden. Das Feld wurde lange den Beratern und Handelnden der AGENDA-Politik überlassen.

Vor allem der Markenkern der SPD, ""die soziale Gerechtigkeit"", ist dabei häufig unter die Räder gekommen. Ein Blick zu unseren Schwesterparteien zeigt, dass außer Labour alle in Schwierigkeiten geraten sind und manche komplett zerlegt werden.

Es gibt also nichts schönzureden oder zu beschwichtigen. Dies tut auch kaum jemand und viele reden davon, dass es kein ""weiter so"" geben darf... und dennoch geht es erst mal genau so weiter. Zumindest bei der Personalauswahl.

Vier der fünf Spitzenpositionen gingen an Politiker des Seeheimer Kreises

Von oben nach unten, nach Proporz und in Hinterzimmern beschlossen. Fünf Spitzenpositionen wurden vergeben - alle an Personen, die den Kurs der letzten 12 Jahre mitgetragen, ja geprägt haben.

Vier davon an Männer von den konservativen Seeheimern, die ja nahezu alle wichtigen Positionen und alle Kanzlerkandidaten der letzten Male gestellt haben. Alle sind gescheitert.

Glaubwürdig wird ein Neuanfang nur, wenn sich der auch in den Köpfen widerspiegelt. Dabei geht es nicht um den einen ""Sündenbock"". Aber es geht sehr wohl um personelle Verantwortung, vor allem derjenigen, die schon länger unseren Kurs an den Schalthebeln der Partei, der Regierung und der Fraktion maßgeblich mitbestimmt haben.

Eine SPD wieder für die Vielen, nicht die Wenigen!

Die Basis ist das Herz der Sozialdemokratie, sie muss mehr und deutlicher eingebunden werden, darf nicht nur im Wahlkampf wichtig werden.

Wichtige Entscheidungen dürfen nicht durch Parteikonvents beschlossen werden, wo hauptsächlich Mandatsträger und hohe Parteifunktionäre sitzen.

Mitgliederbefragungen und auch die Einbeziehung von Sympathisanten und Bündnispartnern müssen erleichtert werden. Der Parteiapparat muss modernisiert, Zugänge und Mitbestimmung gerade auch online erleichtert werden. Wir benötigen mehr inner- und außerparteiliche Transparenz.

Und wir brauchen mehr Debatten und politische Auseinandersetzungen, mehr Lebendigkeit - die SPD war dann am stärksten, als sie heftig um die Themen gerungen hat.

Geschieht dies im offenen Prozess, dann wird sie am Ende geschlossener in die Auseinandersetzung mit der politischen Konkurrenz treten.

Wir sind zu wenig konkret geworden

In einer Zeit, wo die Ungleichheit wächst, wo 10% der Deutschen über 60% besitzen und die Hälfte der Bevölkerung gerade einmal auf 1-3% des Vermögens kommen, hoffen die Menschen auf mehr Gerechtigkeit.

Kurz flackerte bei der Nominierung von Martin Schulz auf, als er das Gerechtigkeitsthema setzte, was für ein großes Potential die SPD eigentlich hat.

Aber dann sind wir zu wenig konkret geworden und die mangelnde Glaubwürdigkeit rückte wieder in den Vordergrund.

Der Wirtschafts- und Gesellschaftswissenschaftler Oliver Nachtwey hat faktenreich dargelegt, dass wir es nicht mehr mit einer Aufstiegs-, sondern inzwischen mit einer Abstiegsgesellschaft zu tun haben. Das sozialdemokratisch geprägte Bildungsversprechen hat seine Wirkung verloren.

Wenn die SPD genau hier ansetzt - mutiger und konkreter - wenn sie es schafft, den Bauch auszusprechen, wieder eine Vision zu entwerfen, dann gibt es eine große Chance darauf, mehr als nur aus dem Schatten einer Union herauszutreten.

Visionen und Botschaften, die vernünftig sind und begeistern

Gerade heute ist eine starke Sozialdemokratie wichtig für unser Land und Europa. Die SPD hat eine stolze Geschichte und sie war Garant für Frieden, Freiheit, Solidarität und Gleichberechtigung.

Wir waren und sind unglaublich wichtig für die Entwicklung unseres Landes und dafür, dass Demokratie nicht marktkonform, sondern der Markt sozial gestaltet wird.

Dazu müssen wir mit unserer Politik wieder Viele erreichen. Dazu brauchen wir wieder Visionen sowie Botschaften, die vernünftig sind UND begeistern.

It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to.
Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals.","For a long time, the way philanthropy worked was simple: Rich people gave their money to museums and churches and opera houses and Harvard. Their names went up on buildings, charities gave them made-up awards, their grandkids went to rehab, the Earth went around the sun. But philanthropy is changing. Today's billionaires are less interested in legacy institutions, less obsessed with prestige and perpetuity. Part of this is a function of their age: In 2012, 4 percent of America’s biggest charitable donations were made by people under 50 years old. In 2014, a quarter of them were. The other factor driving the new philanthropists is how they earned their money in the first place. Last year, six of the 10 largest charitable donations in the United States came from the tech sector, solidifying Silicon Valley’s place as the epicenter of the newer, bigger, disrupty-er philanthropy. There, tech billionaires form “giving circles” to share leads on promising charities, and they hire the same consultants to vet them. They use terms like “hacker philanthropy” and “effective altruism.” These guys—they are mostly guys—believe that they became successful businessmen by upending existing institutions, by scaling simple ideas, by ""breaking shit."" And, with few exceptions, that is how they plan to become successful philanthropists, too. All of this became much more relevant in December, when Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were giving 99 percent of their wealth to charity. The total amount they pledged, around $45 billion in Facebook shares at current valuation, exceeds the endowments of the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations combined. If Zuckerberg gives away the upper limit of what he announced in December, $1 billion per year for the next three years, he will likely become the world’s second-largest charitable donor after Bill Gates. He is 31 years old.

Give Early, Give Billions 4 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 25 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 2012 2014 Percentage of the biggest philanthropic donations that came from people under 50.

Zuckerberg’s ability to remake the world in his own image, in his own lifetime, is unprecedented. Andrew Carnegie opened his first library when he was 68, and only managed to get around $5 billion in today’s dollars out the door before he died. John D. Rockefeller, generally considered the most generous industrialist in history, launched his foundation when he was 76, and only gave away around half his fortune. If he wanted to, Zuckerberg could eradicate polio, or de-neglect half a dozen tropical diseases, or fix all the water pipes in Flint, or give $9,000 to every single one of the world's refugees. But $45 billion, as a former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grantee put it, is ""a 1,000-pound gorilla."" You don't give away that much money without changing the places and institutions and people you give it to, sometimes for the worse. Zuckerberg should already know this. In 2010, he donated $100 million to the Newark Public Schools on a promise from Cory Booker that he could, according to Dale Russakoff's The Prize, ""flip a whole city."" Zuckerberg rode into Newark with the suddenness of a software update. He was determined to end the stalemate between the teachers’ union and the district, establish dozens of new charter schools and close down failing public ones. Oh, and establish a model that could be replicated in urban school districts all over the country. All in just five years. Needless to say, it didn't happen. Up to $20 million of the donation went to consultants, scrappy little MBAs charging $1,000 a day to develop, among other things, an algorithm that assigned thousands of children to new schools. And nobody bothered to ask parents or teachers whether they wanted to be flipped, causing a ton of resentment that ultimately slowed everything down. By 2015, Zuckerberg was touting Newark's charter schools, with 14,000 students, as a success. Meanwhile, its public schools, with 35,000 students, were announcing a budget deficit of $65 million and layoffs of up to 30 percent of their staff. As Antony Bugg-Levine, the CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, told me, the hard part about social change “is that it doesn’t scale like a social network.” I’ve spent the last few months talking to more than 40 researchers, development practitioners, foundation employees and other Silicon Valley philanthropists, asking them about the difficult business of giving money away. They told me about their own Newarks: Promising ideas scaled into oblivion, donations that disappeared into corrupt governments, groupthink disguised as insight. But they also told me about projects that worked, that scaled, that matched the ambitions of the new philanthropy while avoiding its blind spots. And it turns out that some of the best ideas are the ones Zuckerberg is the least likely to hear in Silicon Valley.

Since December I've been studying Zuckerberg’s Facebook posts like a Talmudic scholar, looking for hints of what he's interested in, trying to figure out the investments and bets and mistakes he's going to make. So far he’s light on specifics, mostly speaking in gushy bromides about ""connecting people"" and ""building strong communities."" But if there is one clear, undeniable, overriding theme that emerges, it is this: Zuckerberg believes in the power of technology to transform the world. ""We must build technology to make change,"" he wrote last fall. ""Many institutions invest money in these challenges, but most progress comes from productivity gains through innovation."" He's not wrong. Nearly every social advance in history has technology somewhere near the center of it—the aqueduct, the steam train, the birth control pill. And whenever you start asking people about the life-altering potential of Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and the tech-based philanthropy he represents, the first words you're likely to hear are “The Green Revolution.” In 1975, nearly three out of five people in Asia lived on less than $1 a day. Rains at the wrong time of year meant the difference between starvation and survival. Then, researchers funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations created new crops—varieties that grew taller, needed less water and could be planted year-round. Over the next 30 years, this innovation radically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Rice yields spiked by 1,000 percent. Wheat got cheaper, healthier and more abundant. Norman Borlaug, the scientist who developed the new wheat varieties, won the Nobel Prize.

It's understandable to be seduced by this story. America spent more than 100 years going from a poor agrarian society to a rich urban one. Technology, the development agencies and the foundations tell you, has the potential to ""leapfrog"" this process for the next batch of countries, to boost poor communities into the middle class without all the messy slave labor and cholera we went through on the way. But as Kentaro Toyama, a former Gates Foundation consultant and the author of Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology, points out, it’s not the development of technology that leads to social change, but the application of it. The Green Revolution, he says, wasn't just a case of ""new crops, big changes."" At the same time the farmers were planting the higher-yield crops, governments were dramatically reforming their agricultural policies. Between 1972 and 1990, Asian countries nearly tripled their investments in agriculture. They provided subsidized loans for farmers to buy fertilizer, trained them in how to plant the new crops and built roads and canals to get their produce to markets. In 1970, only 12 percent of the agricultural land in Bangladesh was irrigated. By 1995, 38 percent of it was. ""Technology,"" Toyama says, ""is the easiest part of any solution."" The hard part is everything that comes afterward. Take car crashes, which kill more people every year than tuberculosis or pulmonary disease. The technology to prevent these deaths—seat belts, motorcycle helmets—is not rocket science. It's just that no one has figured out how to make it appeal to the people who need it, especially in the developing world, where 90 percent of these deaths occur. Sometimes technological solutions aren't up against indifference, but outright resistance. In the ’80s, a global health NGO called PATH got a grant to develop Uniject, a pre-filled, single-use syringe designed for midwives or birth attendants to inject patients in their homes. The syringe was ready in the mid-1990s, but more than 15 years later, it had only been rolled out in one developing country. The others had laws that prohibited anyone but doctors from giving injections. ""Lots of new technologies require policy changes to be effective,"" says Michael Free, the former director of product development for PATH. ""Getting buy-in for that takes a lot longer."" All these snags, though, are too complicated for the clean ""leapfrogging"" narrative you hear from the techno-utopians—and from Zuckerberg himself. ""A few months ago I learned about a farmer in Maharashtra called Ganesh,"" Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed in the Times of India in December. ""Last year Ganesh started using Free Basics [Facebook's no-cost Internet service for developing countries]. He found weather information to prepare for monsoon season. He looked up commodity prices to get better deals. Now Ganesh is investing in new crops and livestock."" This, too, is tempting to swallow whole. If farmers knew the prices they'd get for their produce, they could choose the market offering the highest price, or plant more profitable crops in the first place. Entire communities could be changed by the simple injection of information. The only published evidence of this effect in the real world, though, is a 2007 study that showed fishermen in Kerala, India, checking prices for their fish before deciding which port to sell them to. These fishermen sell a perishable good. They have to sell it to someone, they have to sell it today and it's the same distance back to the shore regardless of which port they pick. But the typical African or Indian farmer does not live perfectly equidistant from several produce markets. One might take an hour to get to, the other 10. And when farmers in developing countries buy seeds, they are not comparison-shopping between dozens of stores. They have just a few options, and often have to go through village middlemen or loan sharks. ""Even when you have the information,"" Toyama says, ""you're not in a situation where you can get any benefit from it."" Also, when “leapfrogging” happens, it can be less of a jump and more of a step. The Kerala study, which sounds so transformative, only boosted incomes for fishermen by around 8 percent, and reduced the price of fish for consumers by 4 percent. It didn’t turn poor fishermen into white-collar workers, and it didn’t give a broad swath of the population access to more nutritious food. And guess what? That's fine! If there's one piece of advice that emerges from the last 50 years of the tech-for-the-poor hope and disappointment cycle, it is this: Chase the 8 percents. Zuckerberg has interest and expertise in technology, and there's nothing inherently wrong with making bets on gadgets or innovations that have the potential to help the poor. But as he does so, he should acknowledge that the silver-bullet promise of technology only works at changing the world when it's combined with political will and popular demand. Until he finds a way to engineer those (please don't), he should focus on the small ways, at the margins, where technology can improve people's lives, 8 percent at a time.

$45 Billion Isn't That Much Money

In 2001, the Gates Foundation gave PATH and the World Health Organization $70 million, 10 years and a simple objective: Develop a vaccine for meningitis A and make it affordable for every single person who needs it. At the time, meningitis A was concentrated in one part of the world, a stripe across the middle of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ""meningitis belt."" The disease mostly affected children, causing them to die or become paralyzed in minutes. The yearly outbreaks were predictable. Where they would happen, and how severely, were not. Eventually, PATH developed a vaccine that gave patients 15 years of immunity. At a cost of around 50 cents a dose, public health departments in every country in the meningitis belt could afford to procure it at scale. By 2013, less than a decade after an outbreak killed 25,000 people, the meningitis belt had just four reported cases. Marc LaForce headed the team in charge of bringing the vaccine to market. He says it wasn't just the scale of the Gates donation that mattered, but its duration. In those days, most grants were capped at two or three years, with check-ins every six months. Years of work could be wiped away if a donor decided progress was moving too slowly and pulled out. ""If you want to do something major,"" LaForce says, ""you need the ability to go two steps forward, then one step back."" Plus, the Gates team left LaForce alone. Back then, the foundation only employed about a dozen people who worked out of a small office in a residential neighborhood of Seattle. Staffers spent their time making lists of diseases, ranking them by annual fatalities, then calling around to find out which ones were closest to being cured. “We didn’t need to be specialists,” says Gordon Perkin, the foundation’s first director of global health. “We just needed to know which organizations had the judgment and the infrastructure, and we gave them money.” This story doesn't just illustrate the potential of philanthropy. It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to. Because one way to look at his $45 billion is that it's a lot of money. Another way to look at it is that it's about what the United States spends on prisons every six months. Or education every four weeks. Or health care every five days. Even at a scale that large, efficiency matters. It’s shocking just how unusual that early Gates grant was. Most legacy foundations pay consultants millions of dollars to study and re-study problems before they give grants toward solving them. The Ford Foundation spends nearly $1 for every $4 it gives away. In 2013, the Rockefeller Foundation’s largest grant recipient (other than its offshoot, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors), was Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm. “All the work was to provide advice on internal decision-making,” a former Rockefeller employee told me. “To make it seem charitable we'd ask them to write a blog on our website, and that would frequently be the only public or charitable thing to come out of these multimillion-dollar so-called grants.” (In a statement, the Rockefeller Foundation defended its approach, saying that it “has developed a rigorous model on how to determine the problems we support, and ultimately the solutions that we believe will create the most impact.”)

Won't Somebody Please Think of the Consultants? $146.4M What the Ford Foundation spent in 2013 deciding how to give its money away $539.1M What the Ford Foundation gave away

The Gates Foundation, as it's expanded to more than 1,300 employees, has become prone to the same bloat, the same ""expert-itis,"" as a former grantee calls it. ""They hired Ph.D.s in biotech and all they wanted to do was the science that the grantees were doing."" As the staff proliferated, so did the conditions on the donations. The foundation started requiring grantees to keep track of baggage fees and told them they couldn't buy laptops or let their overhead go above 15 percent. ""Grant approval processes went from 48 hours to 48 months,"" the former grantee told me. (The Gates Foundation responded, too: “While each grant agreement is unique, we have policies in place to help ensure that our funds are spent as effectively as possible."") It’s hard to overstate just how un-Silicon Valley all of this is. ""Money is sitting there to make the world a better place, and to dole it out cautiously is antithetical to why it’s there,"" says Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, a foundation set up by Mitch Kapor, an early investor in Uber and other unicorns. I heard similar arguments from almost all the tech people I talked to: Zuckerberg shouldn't be afraid to fail; he should approach philanthropy like a venture capitalist, testing out ideas to scale up later on. Bypassing legacy institutions is what Silicon Valley CEOs are good at, right? All those consultants must strike them as the charity equivalent of taxi medallions. Still, running a charity does require fully understanding problems before you try to solve them. ""Move fast and break things"" is a fine mentality for Facebook, where the consequences of a few bad lines of code are mostly limited to a drop in revenue or an exodus of users to Snapchat. Applying the same philosophy to health or education or criminal justice has consequences that can't be shrugged away. In the 1990s, Western donors' emphasis on HIV/AIDS in Africa resulted in chronic under-funding of less-visible conditions like pneumonia, anemia and diarrhea. Zuckerberg's donation in Newark resulted in public schools being closed and some kids having to walk through rough neighborhoods to charter schools far from their homes. And it’s this neglected zone, somewhere between bloat and ""break things,"" where Zuckerberg has the opportunity to do something quietly, unsexily awesome. The U.S. has more than 85,000 foundations and 1.5 million charities. Most major charitable causes, things like curing cancer, regularizing immigration and providing early education, are already covered by dozens of capable—and overlapping—organizations. In its annual survey of philanthropists, Grantmakers for Effective Organizations reported that 80 percent of donors wanted to see more collaboration between their grantees. But only 13 percent were willing to consistently pay for it. The need for coordination is obvious when you look at the scale of the problems that philanthropists want to solve. Again, studying Gates’ early years is instructive. When he decided he wanted to vaccinate hundreds of millions of African kids, he didn't set up an organization that would replace WHO or UNICEF or all the other agencies already handing out vaccines. Instead, he founded something called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—a funding pipeline designed to help those agencies work more effectively. Gavi pays pharmaceutical companies to research tropical diseases, it issues ""vaccine bonds"" so poor countries can buy millions of treatments on layaway, it orders medications in such bulk that the cost comes down to pennies. In short, it connects a network of actors who have similar interests—something Zuckerberg knows a thing or two about. So if he really wants to leverage the limited funding he has, Zuckerberg shouldn't think of himself as a venture capitalist. He should think of himself as a mutual fund manager. Find promising organizations, perform due diligence, link them to a portfolio of other agencies doing good work—then give them money and get out of their way. Or, as Patricia Stonesifer, the current CEO of Martha's Table and the former CEO of the Gates Foundation, puts it, “Don’t expect to be the only solution out there.”

Capitalism: The Cause of, and Solution to, All of Life’s Problems

What Zuckerberg actually announced last December wasn't a big fat donation to charity. All he did was establish a limited liability company (LLC) and issue a promise that he would use it for good. Much of the reaction at the time was suspicious, speculating that an LLC was a scheme for Zuckerberg to avoid taxes (which isn't true) or that it would allow him to spend mountains of money without disclosing how he was doing so (which is). But the corporate approach actually makes a lot of sense. Under the standard philanthropic model, billionaires set up a foundation and give it a huge endowment. Every year, the foundation has to give away at least 5 percent of its total value. Meanwhile, the other 95 percent gets invested in blue chip stocks, hedge funds, foreign currencies, whatever will keep the total endowment the same size. That's how foundations like Rockefeller and Ford exist in perpetuity: Do-gooders work on one side of the building finding things to donate to, while bankers work on the other side, making sure there's more to donate next year. Recently, though, donors have started to reject this model. Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals. Besides, why should 95 percent of your money just sit there in hedge funds and Halliburton stock, especially if you think you can do just as much good with the money you invest as the money you give away? ""This idea that philanthropy is only about nonprofits is an outdated model,"" says Paula Goldman, a vice president at the Omidyar Network. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, was one of the most prominent tech billionaires to merge his investing and grant-making. The foundation still gives donations, but the LLC provides loans and seed capital and invests in things like solar-powered lighting startups, Brazilian test-prep companies and funds that discover Indian entrepreneurs. Zuckerberg is going even further, giving up on a foundation entirely and putting all of his charity money in a corporate form with no limits on how to spend it. He’s not interested in making his money back. He just wants the flexibility to fund charities or companies or both. Which explains why one of Zuckerberg’s most recent donations wasn’t a donation at all. It was $10 million in seed capital for an education startup called Bridge International Academies, a chain of private elementary schools that wants to deliver education to the world's poorest students. Bridge’s model, which has only been rolled out in Kenya so far, is based on standardization and accountability. Teachers get a centralized curriculum from Bridge experts, then deliver it to kids from an e-reader. Students—and teachers—are tracked in real time, principals notified of everything from attendance rates to busted pipes. The latest class of Bridge students just took their exams. Sixty percent passed, compared to the national average of 49 percent

It's tempting to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either.

The primary appeal of Bridge, especially to investors like Zuckerberg, is the $6 per month it says it charges its students. Operating as a business rather than a charity gives each school an incentive to deliver a decent education and ensures that it’s not going to wither away when development agencies or donors move on to the next idea. But the problem with dispatching private companies to supply basic services is that they replace the public systems already tasked with providing them. Last year, 116 African NGOs signed an open letter to Bridge International Academies and the World Bank, pointing out that $6 per month is in fact a lot of money for a lot of Kenyans. Bridge schools charge extra for uniforms and lunch. Its teachers earn around $90 per month, teaching classes as large as 70 students. Those pass rates 11 percent higher than the national average are great, but the letter also noted that Bridge, with 400 schools, has attracted more than $100 million in international investment. Meanwhile, Kenya's public system, with almost 20,000 schools, has gotten just $88 million. Lucy Bradlow, Bridge's global director of public relations, counters that the majority of Kenyan kids already attend private schools, many of which cost even more than Bridge and provide even less. In public schools, teacher absentee rates are so high that the average kid only gets two hours of instruction per day. She’s right: Bridge is a little bit better than what's already there. But the troubling part about the company isn't the service it provides now, but the one it wants to provide later. Bridge sees itself as a “model,” one that its backers believe can be spread across the entire developing world. It plans to be profitable once it serves 500,000 students. Eventually, it hopes to reach 10 million. Bridge's own marketing materials describe it as “a scalable Academy-in-a-Box solution.” But the history of philanthropy is littered with projects that helped the poor at a small scale, then made them worse off at a larger one. Microfinance started out small, too. The early trials were non-profit, and revenues were invested back into services that would help borrowers pay back their loans. Then, in the late 2000s, responding to donor pressure to be “sustainable,” microlending went private. Citibank, Barclays and Deutsche Bank established microfinance divisions. In 2007, one of the largest microlending banks, Mexico’s Compartamos Banco, even had an IPO, its executives earning millions loaning out money to women and poor farmers and charging interest rates as high as 195 percent. Since most loans were capped at a few hundred dollars, borrowers could only get enough money to set up informal businesses, stuff like selling fruit on the side of the road or giving rides on a scooter. As microloans flooded the market, small-scale services flooded entire economies. In Bangladesh, nearly 25 percent of the population took out a microloan. In Mexico, Compartamos’ customers were taking out new microloans to pay back the ones they already had. By scaling up too fast, microfinance ended up trapping people in the exact cycle—informal work, bottomless debt, low productivity—from which it was designed to free them.

How Microfinance Traps the Poor *As illustrated by someone we’ll call Joey Joey lives in a village. He earns $5 a day working on a farm. He doesn't want to do that anymore. One day, he takes out a microloan for $100. He opens a fruit stand that sells apples for 50 cents each. He sells around 20 a day, so now he’s earning $10. Success! But then the bank starts giving loans to lots of other people in the village, too. Suddenly everyone is selling apples, and Joey has to sell his for 25 cents each to compete. Now, he’s earning $5 a day again. And starting tomorrow, he owes the bank $10 every week to pay off his loan.

It's tempting to stop there, to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to just go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either. One of the most successful private-sector development projects of the last 10 years is M-PESA, the mobile-money system that allows people in Kenya to transfer money via their cell phones. Before the system launched, Kenyans sent money to each other by mail, or by giving envelopes full of cash to bus drivers. Replacing an inefficient, expensive system with a regularized one made everybody better off. That's not as easy to argue, in the long run, about education. So, when Zuckerberg hears pitches from companies seeking to solve the world's problems, he shouldn't ask them if they have a plan to grow, or an ambition to exist in perpetuity. He should ask himself whether he really wants them to replace the systems that already exist, or simply make them better. Because successful companies don't just disrupt other companies—they disrupt economies, governments and the people who depend on them. That's not something that Zuckerberg ever had to worry about, but he has to start.

Go Beyond Giving Directly

In 2009, four grad students came up with an audacious idea: Instead of giving poor people the things we think they need—bags of food, stacks of clothing, a pair of goats—what if we gave them enough money to decide for themselves? They called their charity GiveDirectly, and in 2011 they started doing exactly that. They went to villages in Kenya, found the poorest people living there and transferred $1,000 straight to their cell phones. Later, they came back to ask the villagers what they did with the money. Mostly, it turns out, the villagers spent it on better roofs, better food, paying off debts, starting up businesses. All the stuff the development system used to buy for them—but without any overhead. At first, no one wanted to fund an idea this outlandish. But then, GiveDirectly went to Silicon Valley. Google got in early, awarding the charity its Global Impact Award and dispatching the head of Google.org to sit on GiveDirectly’s board. Since then, GiveDirectly has grown like a Y Combinator startup, its budget ballooning from $700,000 in 2012 to $17.4 million in 2014. In 2013, Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, hosted a coming-out party for the charity with the heads of Dropbox and General Catalyst Partners. Dustin Moskovitz, Zuckerberg's other Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, just handed GiveDirectly $25 million. At five years old, GiveDirectly is the most buzzed-about charity in Silicon Valley. What all this hype ignores, though, is that GiveDirectly's audacious idea has been around for decades. Post-disaster charities have been experimenting with cash transfers since the 1990s. In 2010, when floods deluged one-third of Pakistan, aid workers handed out 1.7 million debit cards pre-loaded with $230. As early as the 1980s, Latin American countries were handing out ""conditional"" cash grants, paying parents to send their kids to school or feed them balanced meals. Even the World Bank, not exactly a laboratory of revolutionary thinking, has poured more than $25 billion into ""social safety nets""—unemployment and pension benefits, basically—in developing countries. ""Welfare"" sounds a lot less “break shit” than transferring money to people via their cell phones, but it is, sorry everybody, the same thing. And that's exactly why Zuckerberg should be excited about giving money directly to poor people: Not because it is a new and revolutionary idea, but because it is an old and effective one—that’s only fulfilling a fraction of its potential. The challenge with direct cash payments, says Owen Barder, the director of Europe for the Center for Global Development, is getting them to all of the people who need them. The places where this strategy has worked well already had functioning banking sectors and national identification systems in place before a disaster struck. In Pakistan, humanitarian agencies used government data to identify the areas with the worst damage, then checked IDs to make sure the debit cards got to the people living there. Most poor countries, though, don't have these pipes laid down. Kenya's Hunger Safety Nets program, which gives cash to people at risk of starvation, took months to establish because payouts were distributed through local agents, whom people didn't trust, or ATMs, which people had never used before. Barder describes a scenario where, 10 minutes after an earthquake hits Nepal, all the people within five miles of the epicenter get $500 on their cell phones. That's a great idea. But it is, he says, a lot harder than it sounds. After the 2005 tsunami, low-caste populations in India were almost entirely excluded from cash transfers because they weren't registered in the national welfare system. In Indonesia, cash transfers were distributed through community leaders who had to come to a central planning center, then travel back to their constituencies with an envelope full of cash. In at least one case, bandits were waiting for them on the bus. The need for modernizing these systems is obvious. In 2009, India launched an ambitious—and largely unheralded—project to issue a 12-digit identification number to all 1.3 billion of its citizens. So far, it has spent around $880 million and registered 970 million people. The numbers are already being used to distribute unemployment checks and disaster relief. But as this effort moves to more remote populations, registering them gets harder. Some farmers have hands so worn the scanners can’t read their fingerprints. Laying down the pipes to get cash transfers to the first 75 percent of a population, the people who have birth certificates and cell phones, is relatively easy. Getting to the last 25 percent, the people one charity could never reach, is technical, slow, expensive and absolutely critical—a perfect project for Zuckerberg.

Il a également affirmé qu'il était un « obstacle » dans l'adoption du projet de loi souhaité et réclamé par l'UPAC.

Mme Trudel, qui dit aussi avoir été mise en état d'arrestation, pendant 15 minutes, a confié au Bureau d'enquête de Québecor que M. Ouellette avait été arrêté alors qu'il s'apprêtait à dévoiler un stratagème impliquant l'UPAC, l'Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) et une firme de consultants.

Si l'AMF a catégoriquement nié ces allégations lundi matin, le gouvernement du Québec a annoncé que la vérificatrice générale Guylaine Leclerc allait « effectuer une vérification sérieuse » à ce sujet et soulever « toutes irrégularités potentielles ».

L'UPAC, quant à elle, n'a toujours pas porté d'accusations contre M. Ouellette et n'a pas mentionné que Mme Trudel avait été elle aussi arrêtée.

Ce lundi 30 octobre, le New York Times et CNN ont révélé que Paul Manafort, ancien directeur de campagne de Donald Trump, était mis en accusation dans le cadre de l'enquête sur une ingérence de la Russie dans la campagne présidentielle américaine de 2016.

Paul Manafort s'est rendu au FBI ce lundi matin dans le cadre de cette enquête menée par le procureur spécial Robert Mueller. Il a été assigné à résidence par une juge dans la soirée.

Il a été inculpé et 12 chefs d'inculpation ont été retenus contre lui, dont ceux de complot contre les États-Unis, blanchiment, fausses déclarations et non déclarations de comptes détenus à l'étranger, a annoncé le porte-parole du procureur spécial de l'enquête russe.

Paul Manafort a plaidé non coupable.

75 millions de dollars sur des comptes offshore

Un associé de Paul Manafort, Richard (""Rick"") Gates, a reçu la même injonction de se livrer à la justice et fait l'objet des mêmes chefs d'inculpation. Lui aussi a plaidé non coupable. Selon le New York Times, le nom de Rick Gates apparaît sur des documents de sociétés domiciliées à Chypre et par lesquelles Paul Manafort aurait reçu des paiements en provenance d'Europe de l'Est.

Manafort et Gates se voient principalement reprocher des activités non déclarées de lobbyiste et consultant en faveur de l'ancien président ukrainien pro-russe, Viktor Ianoukovitch. Plus de 75 millions de dollars ont transité par des comptes offshore gérés par les deux hommes, Paul Manafort étant accusé d'avoir blanchi à lui seul 18 millions de dollars. Ces opérations lui ont permis de ""mener grand train"" aux États-Unis, acquérant notamment diverses propriétés luxueuses, souligne l'acte d'accusation.

Paul Manafort a dirigé la campagne de Donald Trump jusqu'en août 2016 avant d'être contraint de démissionner.

Donald Trump n'est pas visé par l'enquête

Robert Mueller, nommé le 17 mai par le numéro deux du ministère de la Justice, a pour mission d'enquêter sur l'existence d'une éventuelle collusion entre la Russie et l'équipe de campagne de Donald Trump, mais il a également le pouvoir de remonter toute piste émanant de ses investigations.

Le président républicain, dans une série de tweets dimanche, a encore réfuté la moindre ""collusion"" avec la Russie durant la campagne. ""Toutes ces histoires 'russes' juste quand les républicains s'attaquent à une baisse et réforme historiques des impôts. Est-ce une coïncidence ? NON!"" a-t-il tweeté.

Lundi, il a encore réagi en affirmant que les faits reprochés à Paul Manafort remontaient à ""des années"". ""Il n'y a AUCUNE COLLUSION!"", a-t-il également écrit.

Lui-même ne semble pas visé, dans l'immédiat, par l'enquête. C'est ce qu'a assuré le gouverneur républicain du New Jersey Chris Christie, un allié, dimanche: ""Le président ne fait pas l'objet d'une enquête"". ""Personne ne lui a dit qu'il l'était"", a-t-il dit, en expliquant que les avocats des suspects étaient généralement en contact avec les procureurs avant une mise en examen.

""Ce n'est que le début""

Un troisième membre de l'entourage proche de Donald Trump a été mis en accusation plus tard dans la matinée: George Papadopoulos, qui était chargé des questions de politique étrangère pendant la campagne, a été mis en accusation et a plaidé coupable d'avoir menti aux enquêteurs du FBI. Il a, par ses fausses déclarations, ""entravé l'enquête en cours du FBI sur l'existence de liens ou de coordination éventuels entre des personnes associées à la campagne et le gouvernement russe pour interférer dans l'élection présidentielle de 2016"", souligne l'acte signé par le procureur Robert Mueller.

""Quoiqu'il arrive, ce n'est que le début"", a estimé le sénateur indépendant Angus King, apparenté au groupe démocrate, sur CNN. Robert Mueller, a-t-il dit, est ""un pro"" qui ""remontera les faits, où qu'ils mènent"". La porte-parole de la Maison Blanche, elle, a au contraire affirmé lundi s'attendre à ce que l'enquête du procureur spécial s'achève ""bientôt"".

Robert Mueller, patron du FBI de 2001 à 2013, ne s'est jamais exprimé publiquement sur l'enquête ultra-sensible dont il est chargé. Il a été nommé après le limogeage du directeur du FBI James Comey, pour reprendre l'enquête qui était menée par la police fédérale, afin d'en garantir l'indépendance. Ces investigations sont distinctes des trois enquêtes principales menées par trois commissions du Congrès.

Donald Trump a indiqué lundi, par la voix de la porte-parole de la Maison Blanche Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, qu'il n'avait ""aucune intention"" de remettre en cause le procureur spécial.

""Call of Duty: WWII""

""Star Wars Battlefront II"" und die anderen vorgestellten Games können Sie hier (vor-)bestellen

Wie in jedem Jahr bekommen Shooter-Fans eine Auskopplung der ""Call of Duty""-Reihe. 2017 sind viele allerdings besonders gespannt, denn nach mehreren Jahren kehrt die Serie zu ihren Wurzeln zurück. Statt auf moderne oder gar futuristische Kriegsführung zu setzen, spielt ""Call of Duty: WWII"" im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Der Shooter, der am 3. November für PC, PS4 und Xbox One erscheint, hat neben einer mitreißenden Kampagne natürlich zudem wieder zahlreiche Mehrspieler-Modi zu bieten - darunter auch den beliebten ""Zombies""-Modus.

""Star Wars Battlefront II""

Nicht weniger Vorfreude verspüren viele Shooter-Liebhaber, wenn sie an den 17. November denken. Dann geht es für PC-, PS4- und Xbox-One-Spieler nämlich wieder in eine ""weit, weit entfernte Galaxis"". In massiven Sci-Fi-Schlachten kämpfen sich in ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" bis zu 40 Spieler gleichzeitig durch actiongeladene Multiplayer-Modi - teils in der Rolle von neuen und alten Franchise-Ikonen wie Rey, Darth Vader, Han Solo oder Darth Maul. Erstmals gibt es auch eine Einzelspieler-Story, die eine neue ""Star Wars""-Geschichte erzählt, die nach ""Die Rückkehr der Jedi-Ritter"" spielt.

""Sonic Forces""

Nachdem Nintendos Ex-Klempner im Oktober mit ""Super Mario Odyssey"" zurückgekehrt ist, gibt sich am 7. November eine andere Hüpf-Legende die Ehre: Sonic! Auf Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4 und Xbox One gibt der blaue Sega-Igel in ""Sonic Forces"" wieder kräftig Gas, um wieder einmal die düsteren Pläne von Bösewicht Dr. Eggman zu vereiteln. Doch es gibt noch einen weiteren Gegenspieler! Spieler schlüpfen in ""Sonic Forces"" in die Rollen des modernen und klassischen Sonic, aber auch in die digitale Haut eines eigenen Charakters.

""Pokémon Ultrasonne"" und ""Pokémon Ultramond""

Auch die kultigen Pokémon-Minimonster bekommen ab dem 17. November auf 3DS zwei neue Games. ""Pokémon Ultrasonne"" und ""Pokémon Ultramond"" sind zwar in der gleichen Welt wie die 2016 erschienen ""Pokémon Sonne"" und ""Pokémon Mond"" angesiedelt, erzählen aber eine alternative Geschichte. Mit dabei sind unter anderem auch neue Pokémon und frische Elemente, die es in den Vorgängern noch nicht gab.

""Need for Speed: Payback""

Gamer, die den ""Need for Speed"" spüren, werden vermutlich mit ""Payback"" glücklich, dem neuen Teil der gleichnamigen, langjährigen Rennspielreihe. Ab dem 10. November besinnt man sich auf PC, PS4 und Xbox One auf alte Stärken. Jede Menge Action, Verfolgungsjagden, Tuning, unzählige Traumwagen - alles was das Raserherz begehrt, ist mit dabei. Auch eine Story hat das Game zu bieten, die Spieler in die zwielichtige Unterwelt des fiktiven Fortune Valley entführt.

""The Inpatient""

Nach ihrem Horror-Hit ""Until Dawn"" bringen die Briten von Supermassive Games 2017 neben ""Hidden Agenda"" auch den PlayStation-VR-Grusel ""The Inpatient"" heraus, der 60 Jahre vor ""Until Dawn"" spielt. Ohne Erinnerungen wacht der Spieler im Blackwood Pines Sanatorium auf und muss herausfinden, was in der Nervenheilanstalt vor sich geht. Ab 22. November ist das Standalone-Spiel, für das man den PS4-Vorgänger nicht gespielt haben muss, erhältlich.

""Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2""

Neue Superhelden-Action in einer bunten Klötzchenwelt erwarten Kinder und Junggebliebene ab dem 14. November mit ""Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2"" auf Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4 und Xbox One. Aufgepeppt mit dem bekannten Lego-Humor schlüpfen Spieler abermals in die Rollen bekannter Marvel-Superhelden und -Superschurken und erleben spannende Abenteuer für die ganze Familie. Unter anderem mit dabei: die Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Doktor Strange und viele weitere Figuren.

""L.A. Noire""

Erstmals 2011 erschienen, bekommt ""L.A. Noire"", das vielgelobte Detektivabenteuer von Rockstar Games mit Film-Noire-Setting, eine technisch überarbeitete Neuauflage für Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One und HTC Vive. Der Crime-Thriller spielt in einem Los Angeles der 1940er Jahre und lässt Spieler in der Rolle von Detective Cole Phelps zahlreiche Verbrechen aufklären. Neben dem Hauptspiel sind auch alle erschienenen Downloadinhalte im neuen Pack enthalten.

Xbox One X

Am 7. November veröffentlicht Microsoft eine neue Version seiner Heimkonsole. Dank 12 Gigabyte GDDR5 Arbeitsspeicher und 6 Teraflops Rechenleistung wird die Xbox One X die derzeit leistungsstärkste Konsole auf dem Markt.

They could certainly be used to gain leverage over the former Trump associates, but there was no smoking gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia.

WASHINGTON ― There may have been a brief moment Monday morning when the White House thought the week wouldn't be so bad. The federal grand jury indictment unsealed against Donald Trump 's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort , and his longtime associate Rick Gates, dealt with much of their lobbying work before the 2016 election.

Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????

But any moment of optimism would have been short-lived. Not long after Manafort and Gates were in federal custody, special counsel Robert Mueller's team dropped another bombshell: They'd flipped a former Trump campaign adviser months ago.

The charges against Trump's former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos ― a little-known, little-qualified 30-year-old who listed his involvement in Model United Nations as one of his credentials ― may end up being a much bigger part of the Russia investigation. The Papadopoulos charges, dated Oct. 5 but only unsealed on Monday, deal directly with his work during the election and his attempt to link up the Russian government with the Trump campaign. His statements also make clear that he was acting with the involvement of higher-ranking officials in Trump's orbit.

The charges against Papadopoulos became public less than six months after Mueller, a former FBI director, was chosen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to head up the Russia probe. But Papadopoulos was first arrested on July 27, when he landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on a flight from Germany. And he's been cooperating ever since.

The public may only now be seeing the first fruits of Mueller's investigation, but Papadopoulos has been on the hook for a while.

Papadopoulos was charged with lying during an interview with the FBI back in January about his communications with Russians when he served as one of Trump's foreign policy advisers.

On March 24, 2016, just days after Papadopoulos was publicly identified as one of the Trump campaign's foreign policy advisers, he met with a professor in London who had ""substantial connections"" to Russian government officials, according to the charges against him.

In an interview with FBI agents this year, Papadopoulos claimed that the professor had told him the Russians had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton before he'd joined the campaign. But that wasn't true: Papadopoulos wasn't told about the ""dirt"" and ""thousands of emails"" that the Russians had on Clinton until more than a month after he joined the campaign.

Hillary Clinton holds an unscheduled news conference to talk about FBI inquiries into her emails after a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa, on Oct. 28, 2016.

Papadopoulos continued trying to arrange a meeting between the campaign and the Russian government, and he emailed a ""Senior Policy Advisor"" on the Trump campaign to tell them he had ""some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.""

In one email, a ""high-ranking campaign official"" forwarded Papadopoulos' email to another campaign official and noted the need to ""communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips"" and that they should send ""someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.""

Papadopoulos knew about hacked DNC emails

The timing of when Papadopoulos found out that Russia had ""thousands of emails"" on Clinton is particularly noteworthy. Papadopoulos found out the hacked emails existed in April 2016. The leaked emails hacked from Democratic National Committee staffers' accounts weren't made public until July 2016. And the emails hacked from John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, weren't released until October.

That means a Trump campaign official knew something was coming from the Russian government that would damage the Clinton campaign, months before the public did.

In his interview with the FBI, Papadopoulos allegedly tried to downplay his meetings with the professor with ties to Russia, calling him ""a nothing."" In reality, Papadopoulos knew of the professor's ""substantial connections to Russian government officials"" and used the professor's connection to try to connect the campaign with the Russian government.

The pending charges against Manafort are still significant because of the leverage they offer Mueller. Manafort, 68, could face a stiff federal prison sentence if convicted, which gives Mueller's team serious leverage to convince him to fully cooperate in the probe about the campaign's connections to Russia.

Paul Manafort listens during a discussion on security at Trump Tower in the Manhattan borough of New York on Aug. 17, 2016.

The White House circulated talking points Monday, asking its GOP allies to stress that Manafort is ""not a part of the administration."" Conservative media also downplayed the indictment, saying Manafort's problematic work was ""many years before he joined Trump"" and ""well before"" he joined the campaign.

Papadopoulos is also not part of the current administration, but the three indictments together make it tougher for Trump to completely distance himself from the controversy. In the past, the Trump team has tried to write off troubling individuals as peripheral to their operation.

While Papadopoulos was a low-level official, he was certainly a part of the campaign. He attended a meeting with Trump and Jeff Sessions, who later became attorney general, in March 2016. There's even a photo of them at a table together, with Papadopoulos sitting four places to Trump's right and two places to Sessions' left.",Robert Mueller Flipped A Trump Campaign Adviser.

When the photographer asked maid of honour Sharilyn Wester to throw the bride’s veil, the cheeky friend hammed up the melodrama - with hilarious results. Thankfully the bride, Rebecca Foster, was in on the joke from the start and knew Sharilyn was planning to make a scene. But her new husband, James, was in for a surprise.

Ashley Hempel Photography

Canadian photographer Ashley Hempel posted the series of images on Facebook on Thursday, along with the caption: “Not quite what I meant when I asked for a veil toss.” Speaking to HuffPost UK, Sharilyn confirmed the bride, who is originally from England, was in on the prank. “We’ve been best friends since after high school. I’m originally from Canada but am living in the USA now, so we knew that being together again at her wedding, we had to do something memorable,” she said. “We both have the same strange sense of humour.”

Luckily the photographer, Ashley Hempel, was also up for a laugh. “Sharilynn and Becca actually had this idea, we were in the middle of shooting the formals and Becca said they wanted to do this veil toss picture,” she told HuffPost UK. “I was like ‘sure, let’s do it!’ But I had no idea what they actually had in mind! “Sharilynn held the veil up and did her crazy poses and I died.

Mais les chercheurs se demandent si ces jeunes n'auraient pas déjà tendance à adopter de toute façon des comportements à risque, quels qu'ils soient.

L'étude, menée auprès de plus de 44 000 élèves du secondaire en Ontario et en Alberta, établit en tous cas un lien très étroit entre le vapotage et le passage au tabagisme un an plus tard seulement.

L'étude s'est penchée sur le vapotage chez les élèves de la première année du secondaire jusqu'à la dernière, en 2013-2014, avec un suivi un an plus tard. Les chercheurs ont constaté que les jeunes qui vapotaient déjà au moins 30 jours avant le début de l'étude couraient plus de risques, un an plus tard, d'avoir essayé la cigarette — et de devenir fumeurs au quotidien.

Mais selon le chercheur principal, David Hammond, professeur à la faculté de santé publique de l'Université de Waterloo, la vraie question est de savoir si ces jeunes fument parce qu'ils ont d'abord vapoté, ou parce qu'ils adoptent de toute façon des comportements plus à risque, comme éventuellement l'alcool et la marijuana. Ces jeunes «à risque» pourraient donc se tourner d'abord vers la cigarette électronique tout simplement parce qu'elle est plus facilement accessible que les autres substances, suggère le professeur Hammond.

Le Canada n'a pas approuvé la vente de cigarettes électroniques contenant de la nicotine par les détaillants traditionnels de cigarettes comme les dépanneurs ou les supermarchés. Par contre, les produits de vapotage sont facilement accessibles en ligne ou dans des petites boutiques spécialisées, qui ont poussé comme des champignons depuis quelques années.

La vente des cigarettes électroniques sans nicotine, disponibles dans une vaste gamme de saveurs, n'est pas réglementée au Canada, mais cela pourrait changer bientôt. Le Sénat a adopté en juin un projet de loi, actuellement étudié par les députés, qui réglementerait ce secteur. Ce projet de loi interdirait notamment la vente de produits de vapotage aux mineurs, et l'interdiction de saveurs destinées à attirer une jeune clientèle — comme on l'a fait pour la cigarette «aromatisée».

L'Association médicale canadienne (AMC) recommande que les provinces imposent aux cigarettes électroniques les mêmes restrictions de vente que pour les produits du tabac. «Les résultats de cette étude apportent des arguments supplémentaires pour inciter le gouvernement à limiter davantage encore la vente de produits souvent conçus expressément pour séduire les jeunes gens», estime le docteur Laurent Marcoux, président de l'AMC.

Les résultats de l'étude dirigée par le professeur Hammond sont publiés dans le Journal de l'AMC, qui jouit toutefois d'une indépendance éditoriale face à l'association médicale.

Le SUV cumule tous les défauts mais c'est le carton de la décennie. Les voitures hautes sur pattes représentent cette année 31% des ventes totales et 80% des citadines compactes. Autant dire qu'un constructeur qui ferait l'impasse sur ces autos serait traduit devant un tribunal au mieux pour manque de jugeote et au pire pour suicide collectif. Quant aux usines qui persistent à fabriquer des berlines et autres monospaces, ce truc d'un autre siècle, ils en paient le prix. Ainsi l'unité de production Renault de Douai, qui fabrique les Scenic et Espace doit revoir ses cadences à la baisse, et réduire son nombre d'intérimaires. C'est dans cette ambiance du tout SUV que pas moins de 5 nouveautés pointent le bout de leur nez haut perché en cette seule rentrée. Un record. Et il y en a pour tous les goûts et en provenance de tous les pays. D'Allemagne (Volkswagen T-Roc), d'Espagne (Seat Arona), de Tchéquie (Skoda Karoq) ou de Corée (Kia Stonic et Hyundai Kona). Mais l'un d'entre eux est Français et il est bricolé par un constructeur dont c'est la première incursion assumée dans ce domaine.

Car jusqu'ici, Citroën n'osait pas vraiment. Son C4 Cactus était un Monsieur Jourdain du SUV qui ne s'affichait pas ainsi. Ce fut un flop et l'auto, débarrassée de son (plutôt sympathique) accoutrement d'origine revient aujourd'hui sous la forme d'une berline classique. Autre tentative des chevrons: le C-Crosser n'est qu'un SUV Mitsubishi rapidement rebadgé. Une auto qui, elle non plus, n'aura pas marqué le paysage roulant français. Mais la troisième tentative pourrait bien être la bonne. Le C3 Aircross évite toutes les embuches, ou presque, ce qui est plus facile lorsque l'on arrive sur un marché après ses petits camarades.

Un dessin presque enfantin

Il s'éloigne de ses petits camarades par son look d'abord. Le designer Alexandre Malaval réussirait à donner de la frivolité à une enclume et à injecter de la gaieté dans une ligne aussi figée que celle d'un SUV. Il s'est appliqué à mélanger les couleurs, à superposer les feux à l'avant, à coller des persiennes sur le profil arrière et à renouveler l'intérieur. Du coup, une triste auto devient un objet joueur et presque enfantin. Les petits qui la découvriront chez le garagiste seront ravis, mais il faut aussi séduire les parents. Pour eux la partie pratique et mécanique vient à la rescousse. Le C3 Aircross dispose du plus grand coffre de la catégorie, l'espace à l'arrière est gigantesque et les sièges coulissent. Côté moteurs, en revanche, c'est un peu moins fun. Les blocs essence et diesel n'ont rien de bien nouveau et ils équipent déjà d'autres modèles Peugeot et Citroën. Ils font honnêtement le job mais sans excès, et surtout sans faire de l'ombre à leurs concurrents notamment allemands.

Trois blocs essence (82, 110 et 130ch) et deux diesels (100 et 120ch) sont disponibles, même si ces derniers ne devraient pas remporter un franc succès, la part du mazout ayant heureusement chuté depuis deux ans sur les autos de cette taille. Reste qu'avec le moteur essence trois cylindres de 110ch, le plus recommandable, ce petit SUV est à son affaire, parfaitement servi par un châssis qui allie le confort à la tenue de route. Et c'est un sacré challenge que les ingénieurs Citroën ont dû relever. Les lois de la physique étant invariables, plus le centre de gravité d'une voiture est élevé (20cm dans le cas de celui-ci), plus sa tenue de cap est aléatoire. Résultat: depuis la déferlante de ces engins, le confort est aux abonnés absents. Pour préserver la sécurité, éviter le roulis et les sorties de piste, les concepteurs de ce genre d'auto ont durci les suspensions. Résultat: les SUV tiennent la route mais leurs occupants ont l'impression d'être assis sur un bout de bois. Pas à bord de celui-là. Certes, cet Aircross n'atteint pas le confort d'une berline, mais les muscles fessiers et les lombaires de ses passagers sont préservés.

Les rebelles en berline, les autres en SUV

Le nouveau Citroën C3-Aircross fait donc office de nouvelle référence dans son domaine. Faut-il l'acheter pour autant? Ceux qui cèdent aux faciles sirènes de la mode auront raison de lui céder. Les autres, les résistants aux tendances du moment, s'offriront une berline classique (Renault Megane, Citroën C4, Peugeot 308). Elles sont plus dynamiques, plus confortables, leur tenue de route est plus sûre et leur prix comparable, puisque ce SUV s'affiche entre 16.000 et 24.000 euros, selon son moteur et sa finition.

Cette proposition signée par le groupe Modem de l'Assemblée nationale veut ""instaurer le principe général de résidence des enfants chez chacun de leurs parents, afin de traduire leur égalité, cela toujours dans le respect de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant"". Ce qui va non seulement à l'encontre des réalités, mais aussi à l'encontre de la défense des plus faibles.

En l'état du droit, les juges aux affaires familiales (JAF) sont invités à accorder la garde alternée à condition que les parents soient volontaires, s'entendent bien et soient géographiquement proches. Cela procède du bon sens, mais surtout repose sur une appréciation par le juge de la réalité des relations entre les parents.

Cependant, force est de constater que les JAF, sensibles à l'air du temps médiatique et aux revendications de certaines associations pro-pères ""imposent"" trop souvent la résidence alternée à une femme victime d'un conjoint physiquement ou psychologiquement violent, sans tenir compte du contexte délétère dans lequel va devoir évoluer l'enfant.

Dans ces divorces forcément conflictuels, une garde alternée fragilise énormément la mère, le parent maltraitant, se sentant soutenu par la justice, continue d'harceler son épouse ou ex-épouse en instrumentalisant leur enfant. La violence sur les mères est une violence sur les enfants!

Malheureusement, certaines idées reçues continuent de faire des ravages dans les tribunaux: ""Un conjoint maltraitant peut être néanmoins un bon parent!"", ""Mieux vaut un père maltraitant que pas de père du tout!""

Si on peut comprendre le traitement ""inégalitaire"", dénoncé par les associations de pères qui réclament systématiquement la résidence alternée et si, effectivement, dans la plupart des cas, une garde alternée est souhaitable, une telle mesure est inimaginable dans un contexte de violences!

Doit-on sacrifier femmes et enfants sous prétexte d'égalité?

L'égalité est un concept philosophique, un idéal politique et même un principe constitutionnel, mais le principe de précaution doit rester prioritaire.

La maltraitance et le harcèlement via les enfants sont trop fréquents pour pouvoir être balayés par un texte de circonstance, voire de ""bonne pensance"".

Proposer de systématiser la garde alternée va forcément amplifier –en toute légalité– la maltraitance envers les femmes et les enfants.

Il faut ne pas non plus oublier la violence économique engendrée : la résidence alternée entraînant la perte partielle ou intégrale des pensions alimentaires et aides, alors que les charges fixes de ces femmes isolées ne baissent pas.

Un parlementaire ne doit-il pas d'abord réfléchir, connaître le sujet, se renseigner pour pouvoir légiférer en toute connaissance de cause?

Reprenez-vous Mesdames et Messieurs les députés! Réfléchissez avant d'apposer votre signature à un texte de régression morale qui fragilise les femmes et les enfants en situation de faiblesse.

Battez-vous plutôt pour que la justice ait davantage de moyens, davantage de personnels formés, avec une vraie possibilité de juger en toute connaissance de cause, dans des délais qui soient les plus courts possibles, car la vie –elle– n'attend pas!

In yet another instance of fear dictating art, comedian Shyam Rangeela's mimicry of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was allegedly dropped by Star Plus as the channel felt it might incite protests across the country.

In an interview with The Wire, Rangeela said, ""The production team told me that the decision to not air my act was taken because the channel feared that it will offend some people and they might protest against them.""

The comedian, who was specially invited by the channel after his videos went viral online, was categorically told not to submit any new material that satirised Modi.

But they were initially open to doing segments on Rahul Gandhi.

""But later they told me I can't do Rahul either,"" Rangeela told The Wire.

Ironically enough, Star India's CEO, Uday Shankar, in an interview to this writer, had said that censorship by mob rule is choking the industry.

He had said, ""Censorship is choking the business and that is precisely why the industry must take it up. But nobody takes up the issue! When someone talks about it, it becomes the exception than the norm.""

He had further said that we're reaching a point of 'anarchy'. ""This is dangerous because it's creating a culture of anarchy. The mob is taking control. And within the mob, it's the loudest member that is taking charge.""

HuffPost India reached out to the channel's spokesperson, Preeti Puri Sharma, for a comment but is yet to receive a response.

Der Erzkonservative war als Sprecher des Kongresses der fähigste Gegenspieler von Barack Obama

Jetzt hat sich Boehner nach langem Schweigen zurückgemeldet - und seine eigene Partei heftig kritisiert

Jahrelang hat John Boehner seinen politischen Widersacher Barack Obama in den Wahnsinn getrieben. 2011 wurde der erzkonservative Politiker zum Sprecher des mehrheitlich republikanischen Kongresses in den USA - und blockierte von da an jedes politische Vorhaben des ehemaligen Präsidenten.

Boehner war der mächtigste Republikaner des Landes. Dann kam Donald Trump. Im Juni 2015 erklärte dieser, US-Präsident werden zu wollen. Er kaperte die Republikaner, machte aus der ehemals konservativ-traditionellen eine endgültig radikale, rechte Partei. Trump sitzt nun im Weißen Haus, Boehner ist im Ruhestand.

Im Oktober 2015 zog er sich aus der Politik zurück. Seitdem hat Boehner zu den chaotischen Ereignissen in den USA meist geschwiegen. Doch in einem bemerkenswerten Interview mit dem ""Politico Magazine"" hat sich Boehner nun zu Wort gemeldet - und seine eigene Partei mit heftigen Worten attackiert.

Boehner: ""Sie sind beide Arschlöcher""

Vor allem auf einen Politiker hatte es Boehner abgesehen: Jason Chaffetz. Chaffetz hatte vor wenigen Wochen überraschend seinen Rücktritt aus dem Kongress verkündet. Eigentlich war der Politiker als einer der Hoffnungsträger der Republikaner betrachtet worden - er war eines der bekannten Gesichter seiner Partei in den Medien. Nun arbeitet er für den Sender Fox News.

""Bei Chaffetz geht es immer nur um Chaffetz"", sagt Boehner nun ""Politico"". Chaffetz habe politisches Talent, es aber nur genutzt, um seine eigene Karriere voranzutreiben. Der 50-Jährige sei ein ""totaler Blender"", sagt Boehner. Genauso wie Chaffetz Kongresskollege Jim Jordan, ein Republikaner, den Boehner als ""Parlamentsterroristen"" bezeichnet.

""Fuck Jordan, fuck Chaffetz"", flucht Boehner im Interview, ""sie sind beide Arschlöcher.""

Boehner über die republikanischen ""Anarchisten"" im Kongress

Nicht die einzigen im Kongress, wenn man Boehners Ausführungen glaubt. Der ehemalige Chef des Unterhauses lässt sich gegenüber ""Politico"" auch gewaltig über den sogenannten Freedom Caucus aus. In diesem haben sich die radikalsten der republikanischen Kongressabgeordneten organisiert, um eine politische Revolution von rechts voranzutreiben.

""Sie können dir nicht erklären, wofür sie eigentlich stehen"", ätzt Boehner bei ""Politico"" gegen den Freedom Caucus. ""Sie können dir nur sagen, wogegen sie sind. Sie sind Anarchisten, sie wollen totales Chaos."" Der Caucus wolle das ganze politische System zerstören.

Boehner kommt in dieser Hinsicht auch auf Donald Trump zu sprechen. Schon im Mai hatte er dessen Präsidentschaft als ""Desaster"" bezeichnet. Jetzt rolle er laut ""Politico"" mit den Augen, wenn er auf das Weiße Haus angesprochen wird.

Boehner spricht von einer ""Disfunktion"" der Regierung. Er sagt selbstironisch: ""So wie es gerade läuft, da sehe ja selbst ich wie ein Genie aus.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Mehrere republikanische Senatoren proben den Aufstand gegen Trump - der reagiert wütend

Boehner befürchtet das Ende seiner Partei

Trump hingegen sei weder ein Demokrat, noch ein Republikaner. ""Er ist ein Populist, er hat keinerlei Ideologie, der er folgt."" Für die Republikaner hat das laut Boehner schwere Folgen. Angesprochen darauf, wie seine Partei die Zeit unter Trump überstehen will, sagt er zögerlich: ""Es gibt keine Republikanische Partei."" Und es gäbe auch niemanden, der die Republikaner anführe.

Ein Mann, der dies tun könnte, wäre der umstrittene Vize-Präsident Mike Pence. Als ""loyalen Soldaten"" bezeichnet Boehner diesen, als jemanden, der durch alle Verrücktheiten zu Trump gestanden habe. Aber: ""Er und sein Team, sie halten die Augen offen."" Soll heißen: Stürzt Trump, setzt Boehner seine Hoffnungen für die Republikaner in Pence.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Trump ist eine Zumutung. Aber was nach ihm kommen könnte, wäre noch schlimmer

Und nicht in sich selbst. Mit dem politischen Leben will Boehner - trotz aller Wut über den Zustand seiner Partei - abgeschlossen haben. Rauchen, Rasenmähen, Golfen - so lässt er seinen Ruhestand von ""Politico"" darstellen. Das Magazin fragt ihn, wie die Historiker wohl auf ihn und sein politisches Lebenswerk zurückblicken werden.

Boehner sagt: ""Sie werden über das Ende des Zwei-Parteien-Systems sprechen."" Das klingt wie ein Eingeständnis: Die ""Arschlöcher"" unter den Republikanern haben gesiegt.

""I'm very thankful that there are people who know what to do in that situation,"" Gomez said.

Raisa called the experience of surgery and recovery ""humbling."" Gomez's illness had progressed ""to the point where it was really kind of life or death,"" the singer said, adding that she believes her friend saved her life.

""It's really hard to think about, or even to swallow, especially now that as soon as I got the kidney transplant, my arthritis went away, my lupus, there's about a 3 to 5 percent chance it will ever come back, my blood pressure is better. My energy, my life has been better,"" Gomez said.

As she teared up, Gomez continued: ""I just really hope that we can help somebody, I really do. I don't think what we went through was easy. I don't think it was fun. I hope that this inspires people to feel good, to know that there [are] really good people in the world.""

Non pas de peur, mais d'horreur! Vos petits monstres, eux, trépignent d'impatience et comptent les heures qui les séparent de la grande fête.

Vous Halloween, ça ne vous parle pas. Vous êtes déjà en train de calculer votre budget de Noël et vos mouflets ont déjà découpé la quasi intégralité des catalogues de jouets pour la ""fameuse lettre au Père-Noël""

Et tout cela alors que vous vous remettez à peine des heures où vous avez dû consoler votre chère tête blonde de ne rien avoir trouvé à la chasse à l'œuf organisée dans le parc d'à côté. Ssans parler qu'il n'y a pas si longtemps, vous avez vécu l'angoisse de ne pas trouver une fichue pièce d'1 ou 2 euros dans votre porte-monnaie quand sa énième dent est tombée...

Bref, vous n'en pouvez plus!

Mais, en tout bon parent que vous êtes, vous vous dites que c'est bien de faire perdurer la tradition, d'aider vos enfants à rêver, qu'il faut participer aux rites initiatiques, et vous avez envie de garder vos enfants, encore un petit peu dans un monde de Bisounours.

Et vous faites bien, car vos enfants vivent en partie dans un monde imaginaire et ces croyances (Père Noël, petite souris, cloches et autres lapins de Pâques) sont importantes pour son développement. Elles lui permettent, entre autre, d'affronter parfois une réalité un peu difficile.

Courage, ces croyances s'arrêtent vers 7 ans environ!

Bon et Halloween là-dedans? Une croyance? Un rituel? Ou juste une fête commerciale?! Pour l'apprécier, peut-être devez-vous faire l'effort de la comprendre? Et de comprendre pourquoi vous la détestez autant?

Voici une petite liste -non-exhaustive- de raisons qui vous poussent à ne pas l'aimer.

C'est une fête qui a un côté commercial

Oui, c'est vrai! Entre les catalogues de jouets de Noël, on essaie de vous vendre le costume de squelette, de diable, de sorcière, la citrouille-panier, des sacs de bonbons, les décorations, etc.

On ne l'aime pas car on ne la connaît mal et on ne l'a pas fêté enfant

Rendons-nous à l'évidence, on est trop vieux (enfin moi en tous cas!). Et on ne l'a jamais vraiment fêtée, donc elle ne fait pas partie de nos traditions! Et nous, on les aime nos traditions, nos petits rituels, notre madeleine de Proust, la dinde de Noël, le sapin, chercher les chocolats dans le jardin...

Parce qu'elle est mauvaise pour la santé!

Alors qu'on essaie d'inculquer la nourriture ""healthy"" à nos enfants... Halloween nous inflige de ramener à la maison un tsunami de bonbons qui sont en général ni bio, ni healthy! En plus, ça va générer des frustrations et possiblement des crises quand vous allez devoir expliquer à votre petit amour que ""oui, ce sont bien SES bonbons, mais que NON il ne peut pas tous les manger et encore moins les manger quand il veut"".

Il va falloir être gentille avec tous les gosses du quartier

Même ceux qui ont piétiné vos fleurs au printemps dernier avec leur ballon. Et même si vous leur avez acheté un calendrier, des bons de tombola, des brioches, des pizzas tout au long de l'année, il va falloir en plus leur acheter des bonbons!

Le 31 octobre, il fait froid, il fait nuit et encore s'il ne pleut pas

Comment faire un chouette déguisement quand il faut mettre une doudoune dessous sans ressembler à Bibendum? Parce que si vous mettez la doudoune par dessus, vous aurez le droit à ""Mais maman!!! on le voit plus mon costuuuuuuuume!!! Les vampires... ça peut pas être malade !!!""... Donc il va falloir trouver un stratagème pour que petit chouchou n'attrape pas une angine blanche (et qu'il vous pourrisse votre seule semaine de vacances) et qu'il soit ""beau""... disons reconnaissable ça sera déjà pas mal.

Moi aussi, il faut que je me déguise?

Pitié! Le maquillage ça gratte et ça donne des boutons. Et si ça me gratte, je vais en avoir plein sous les ongles. Et je suis nulle en maquillage. Je vais être ri-di-cule...

Comme je vous disais la liste est non-exhaustive. Je vous laisse le soin de trouver encore plein de raisons totalement valables de ne pas aimer Halloween! Parce que...

OUI! Vous avez raison de DETESTER Halloween. Mais votre bout de chou, il vous regarde avec ses yeux remplis de larmes et il vous dit ""Mais mamannnnn... touuuuuuuuus mes copains, ils fêtent Halloween, moi aussi je veux me déguiser et des bonbonnnnnnns!!!...""

Alors voici, mes raisons et astuces pour fêter malgré tout Halloween avec vos enfants... sans trop souffrir...

Tout d'abord, un peu d'histoire. C'est quoi Halloween? Encore un truc que nous envoie les américains?

Après quelques recherches, voilà ce que j'ai trouvé (et oui, internet est mon ami!) Halloween est d'origine Celte (dont le peuple gaulois en était un des plus nombreux!) et surtout Irlandaise et on parlait alors de la fête -païenne- de la Samain... elle fêtait à la fois le début et la fin de l'année Celte, il y a environ 2500 ans. Entre ces deux moments, il y avait une sorte de ""trou noir"", qui permettait aux défunts de passer du monde des morts au monde de vivants pour revoir des êtres chers.

On guidait leurs âmes avec des lanternes pour leur montrer le chemin jusqu'aux maisons. Cette tradition a migré avec les Irlandais en Amérique et est devenue cette chère fête d'Halloween soit ""All Hallow E'en"" c'est-à-dire ""la nuit sainte"", notre Toussaint.

Halloween, telle que nous la connaissons à ce jour a été largement relayée par les médias, séries américaines. Plusieurs siècles après la naissance de cette fête, serait apparu le fait de se déguiser pour effrayer les vilains esprits. Quant à la tradition des ""bonbons ou un tour"", ce serait encore plus récent puisqu'apparue au 19e siècle.

Rendez-vous à l'évidence c'est finalement une fête qui a une histoire... et qui est assez proche de nous car celtique donc Gauloise en partie... Cocorico! C'est de chez nous! Alors on revendique la SAMAIN et on explique toute l'histoire à nos enfants, qui épateront la maîtresse à la rentrée et nous, ça nous permettra de briller un peu en société! J'habite en Bretagne... donc je valide deux fois plus la Samain, en chauvine que je suis!

Ce n'est certes pas une tradition que vos parents vous on transmise, mais pourquoi ne pas créer une nouvelle tradition pour votre famille à vous?

Et vous dire que toute occasion est bonne pour passer du temps avec vos enfants à faire une activité, des créations, du partage! Et puis pourquoi pas se saisir de l'occasion pour faire une fête à la maison avec les copains! Vos copains à vous et les leurs!

Une balade à pieds

Eencore une occasion de partager! On se dit que ce n'est pas grave s'il fait froid, ça ""ravigotte"" comme on dit ici! Et le ridicule ne tue, pas. Touvez un déguisement où on vous reconnaît pas, avec un masque (ça évitera le maquillage qui coule et gratte). Ou encore mieux, allez dans le village ou quartier d'à côté où personne ne vous connaît! Ce qui fait qu'en prime, vous ne serez pas chez vous pour faire la distribution aux gamins du quartier (surtout à ceux qui vous ont piétiné les fleurs!).

Proposez pour finir à une bonne copine de venir avec vous, ça vous paraîtra moins long!

Pour le côté commercial, oui c'est vrai, comme les cadeaux de Noël, comme les chocolats de Pâques, mais est-ce que ça vous empêche d'offrir cadeaux et chocolats?

Et puis vous avez aussi le droit de faire de la résistance!

Confectionnez vous-même les costumes de vos chérubins plutôt que de vous ruer dans les magasins pour le leur acheter!

Vous n'êtes pas une super couturière? Ce n'est pas grave! Ils faisaient comment nos parents pour le carnaval? Du papier crépon et des agrafes! Un rouleau de papier toilette... on tourne, on scotche et hop une belle momie... le tour est joué! Et puis on ressort des vêtements thermiques du dernier séjour à la neige, ou en emprunte aux copines pour éviter d'effet bonhomme Michelin.

Pour le côté ""orgie de bonbons"", j'ai découvert une façon de faire ses propres bonbons!

Si si... Ou vous pouvez prendre des bonbons type au miel, au pin, à la menthe...(ce qui les aidera à se remettre de leur angine!) bref le plus naturels possible. Ou choisissez des petits gâteaux emballés ou sucettes en chocolats à distribuer avec parcimonie pour lutter contre l'orgie... (tant pis pour le surnom de ""radine""...)!

Quant à la gestion de la frustration de vos têtes blondes face à leur sac rempli de bonbons (ou à l'absence de bonbons aussi)... on fait comme à Pâques!

On cadre avant. ""Bien sûr que ce seront tes bonbons, et que tu pourras les manger, mais te rappelles-tu pourquoi il ne faut pas trop manger de bonbons?"" Rien de vous empêche d'intervertir discrètement ses bonbons chimiques par les vôtres plus sains.(et c'est vous qui mangerez les fraises Tagada! AH-AH-AH)

Un dernier argument?

C'est bon pour vos enfants! Et oui, être dans le ""faire semblant"", d'avoir ""pour une fois"" un peu de pouvoir sur les adultes, de les menacer de leur jouer des tours et de leur faire peur, d'affronter aussi un peu leurs propres peurs. Autrement dit, ça les aide à se construire, à grandir, à prendre confiance en eux. N'encourage t-on pas les enfants à demander à la boulangère la baguette de pain? À donner la monnaie? D'aller vendre les tickets de tombola aux voisins? Alors ne serait-ce pas un peu la même chose??!

Allez, courage:) ça va bien se passer! Joyeuse fête de la Samain à toutes et tous!

REUTERS/Jon Nazca | Jon Nazca / Reuters

Offiziell führt jetzt Madrid die Amtsgeschäfte in Katalonien

Nun besteht Hoffnung auf Versöhnung - aber auch ein Boykott der Staatsbediensteten droht

Die separatistische Regierung Kataloniens ist entmachtet. Auf dem Papier zumindest.

Die spanische Zentralregierung stellte die Region im Nordosten des EU-Landes unter Zwangsverwaltung. Das Hauptziel Madrids sind Neuwahlen am 21. Dezember.

Doch wie es in der autonomen Region weitergeht, ist ungewiss. Was wird beziehungsweise kann nun in den nächsten Tagen und Wochen bis zum Urnengang passieren?

10 Fragen und Antworten im Überblick:

1. Wie läuft die Übernahme der Amtsgeschäfte durch Madrid genau ab?

Nach der Veröffentlichung der Absetzung der Regionalregierung von Carles Puigdemont am Samstag im spanischen Amtsblatt ist der Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy auch Regionalpräsident Kataloniens.

In der Praxis übernimmt seine Vizechefin, Soraya Saénz de Santamaría die Amtsgeschäfte. Die Staatssekretäre in den Madrider Ministerien übernehmen die Leitung der jeweiligen Regional-Ressorts. Ob und wie viele Politiker und Beamte im Rahmen der Übernahme von Madrid nach Barcelona versetzt werden, war vorerst noch unbekannt.

2. Ist seitens der abgesetzten Regionalregierung Widerstand zu erwarten?

Puigdemont hat die Unabhängigkeitsbefürworter am Samstag zum friedlichen ""demokratischen"" Widerstand aufgerufen. Sein bisheriger Vize, Oriol Junqueras, der nicht Puigdemonts liberaler Partei PDECat, sondern der linken ERC angehört, schrieb in der Zeitung ""El Punt Avui"", für alle Separatisten bleibe die Regionalregierung im Amt.

Physischer Widerstand ist von den Politikern allerdings nicht zu erwarten. Medien schrieben unter Berufung auf Sprecher der Separatisten sogar, viele der Minister in Barcelona bereiteten sich schon auf eine ""Schlüssel- und Büroübergabe"" am Montag vor.

3. Könnte Madrid bei der Übernahme der Amtsgeschäfte dennoch auf Schwierigkeiten stoßen?

Ja. Die katalanische Regionalregierung hat in Barcelona knapp 110.000 Beamte sowie rund 90.000 Angestellte und Praktikanten, von denen sehr viele überzeugte Separatisten sind. Dem sogenannten ""Verband der Gemeinden für die Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens"" (AMI) gehören zudem 787 aller 948 Bürgermeister an. Beobachter rechnen mit Boykottaktionen.

Die Schriftstellerin und Journalistin Esther Jaén, die sich als Katalanin in der Region sehr gut auskennt, warnte vor einem ""absoluten Desaster"" bei der Vorbereitung der Neuwahlen. Madrid drohte Widerständlern mit der Entlassung.

4. Was passiert unterdessen bei der Polizei? Und mit der Justiz?

Die beiden Chefs der katalanischen Polizeieinheit Mossos d'Esquadra, Pere Soler und Josep Lluís Trapero, wurden abgesetzt und nahmen ihren Hut bereits widerstandslos. Die ""Mossos"" (Jungs) werden jetzt nach Medieneinschätzung den von Madrid eingesetzten neuen Chefs folgen, da bei der Polizei das Gehorsamsgebot gelte.

Im Bereich der Justiz - anders als mit der katalanischen Polizei - war Madrid in Katalonien nie auf Probleme gestoßen. Die katalanische Justiz entschied zuletzt mehrfach gegen die Separatisten.

5. Und was ist mit den Hunderttausenden Anhängern der Unabhängigkeits-Bewegung?

Es gibt Beobachter und Organisationen, die vor Unruhen in den kommenden Wochen warnen. Am Wochenende gab es aber wider Erwarten vorerst nicht eine einzige Protestkundgebung der Separatisten. Diese haben bisher auch zu keiner Demonstration aufgerufen. Es ist aber davon auszugehen, dass die Befürworter einer Spaltung von Spanien wieder auf die Straße gehen werden.

6. Sollte man von der Planung einer Urlaubsreise nach Barcelona lieber absehen?

Nicht unbedingt. Das Auswärtige Amt hatte Spanien-Reisende wegen des Konflikts vor einigen Wochen bereits zur Achtsamkeit aufgerufen. Aber selbst nach der Eskalation des Konflikts gab es bei großen Kundgebungen allenfalls nur kleinere Ausschreitungen.

7. Welche Folgen hat das alles für die Politiker in Katalonien?

Im Prinzip keine Größeren. Obgleich alle abgesetzten Minister ab sofort keine Leibwächter mehr haben. Alle Abgeordneten bekommen aber bis zur Konstituierung des neuen Regionalparlaments ihre Bezüge weiter ausgezahlt. Überwiesen wird das Geld aus Madrid, da Rajoy unter anderem auch die Kontrolle über die Finanzbehörden der Region übernommen hat.

8. Gibt es Konsequenzen für die Menschen?

Auf den Straßen wird sich wenig ändern. Das Zusammenleben war im Zuge der Eskalation des Konflikts in den vergangenen Wochen in Katalonien schon heftig in Mitleidenschaft gezogen worden.

Es gab Diskussionen und auch handfeste Streits unter Arbeitskollegen, Freunden und Angehörigen. ""Ich habe Freunde verloren, die ich seit meiner Kindheit hatte"", sagte Anwalt Pedro der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Viele hoffen nun, dass es zu Versöhnungen kommt.

9. Werden die separatistischen Parteien an der Wahl im Dezember teilnehmen oder den Urnengang boykottieren?

Das stand am Wochenende noch nicht fest. Die Einschreibefrist läuft am 7. November ab. Medien berichteten, es habe in den Parteien bereits Treffen gegeben, um über diese Frage zu sprechen.

10. Wird es auch einen Kandidaten Puigdemont geben?

Entgegen früheren Plänen wird Madrid eine Kandidatur von Puigdemont nicht verhindern - sofern der liberale Politiker bis dahin nicht hinter Gittern sitzt.

Der 54-Jährige könnte schon am Montag von der Generalstaatsanwaltschaft unter anderem der Rebellion beschuldigt und inhaftiert werden. Es droht eine Haftstrafe von bis zu 30 Jahren.

AHMEDABAD -- Former Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela on Tuesday demanded a pre-release screening of movie ""Padmavati"" for Hindu and Kshatriya community leaders to check whether facts have been distorted in the film and warned of violent protests if its makers failed to do so.

""As the movie is expected to be released on December 1, I want Bhansali to first show it to Hindu as well as Kshatriya leaders as people suspect that some facts have been distorted and presented in a wrong way in the movie,"" the Kshatriya strongman told reporters here.

The film, directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and starring Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor, is scheduled for release on December 1.

Vaghela said one cannot tamper with historical facts and present them as per one's wishes to get ""cheap publicity"".

""If the movie is released without pre-screening, Gujarat will witness violent protests and law and order may go out of control. I apologise to the cinema owners in advance if people take law into their hands,"" the former Gujarat chief minister said.

Vaghela quit the Congress after the Rajya Sabha polls in August and launched a new front, Jan Vikalp, which would field its candidates on all the 182 seats in Gujarat, where assembly elections will be held in December in two phases.

The upcoming movie had earlier run into controversy after Rajasthan-based Rajput community group Karni Sena raised objections over depictions in the movie, claiming that history was being distorted.

Earlier this year, Bhansali was attacked by Karni Sena members during the shooting of the film in Rajasthan.

Last month, alleged Karni Sena members burnt posters of the film after the first look of main characters -- Padmavati (Deepika Padukone), Maharawal Ratan Singh (Shahid Kapoor) and Allaudin Khilji (Ranveer Singh) -- was released.

While most of the singer’s fans were excited about the shoot, others found it problematic. Some people thought the shoot was an example of cultural appropriation, considering Rihanna is from Barbados.

The last few weeks have been momentous for survivors of sexual violence, all over the world. Women embraced the hashtag #MeToo to join their voices to the rising chorus of sexual assault victims coming forward to share their trauma, inflicted often by the people they worked and lived with.

The accounts — by both men and women survivors of sexual crimes — were difficult to read, so much so that men joined in with hashtags of their own to show that they were listening, processing and hopefully bettering themselves as allies.

Women shared stories of complicity by institutions, conspiracy of silence in families, of unequal power equations at work spaces, threats to their employment, life and liberty, apart from the patriarchal tool of shame being held over their heads to strangle their voices in a society that already sees sexual harassment more as a result of female provocation and less as male aggression.

However, as the stories of systematic abuse kept pouring in — from Hollywood producers to bar owners — one thing stood out as a beacon of hope — women felt for the first time they have a movement going worldwide that was disruptive and resonant and as a result of which powerful men, predatory men who have never been held responsible their entire lives, were now being outed.

In India, several celebrities came forward to narrate their own stories of surviving sexual violence.

Vidya Balan, a talented actress who has played powerful roles in several films, went on a TV panel discussion, a short clip of which was shared by the channel on Saturday, and discussed the issue of sexual harassment.

This writer has not seen the entire discussion, which will be aired on Sunday, 29 October, and will update the commentary when it does. However this is what she said in the clip that was shared.

""I've been in films for 12 years and not once have I been propositioned y anyone. I've not given anyone I think the space to say anything remotely uncomfortable to me.... There were times.... I would sense that something creepy and I would just walk away from that opportunity. Having said that this was not my bread and butter, I lived with my family in Mumbai, I had food on my plate, I didn't have to worry about rent, I had emotional sustenance... I could walk away. I think no one dared say or do anything to me, I made sure I didn't come across as vulnerable...""

While Balan acknowledged her privilege, her comments were symptomatic of the reasons women don't A. report abuse B. hesitate to speak up C. are not believed when they do.

It's classic victim shaming to imply that a woman brought on her harassment because she did not ""walk away"". Or that she somehow ""made herself vulnerable"". Case studies and statistics show that women of all ages — babies as young as months old — are raped every day in this country. To say that Balan herself had not faced any sexual harassment in 12 years because she did not ""give anyone the space to say anything uncomfortable"" is to imply that those who do get ""propositioned"" invite it by giving their harassers the ""space"". It's not only wrong, but it's an attitude that has seeped into the very fabric of society, colouring the way it looked at women who are sexually active, lead independent lives and fight sexism at all levels.

And it's surprising that Balan phrased it the way she did, since she has been a strong champion of gender rights, standing up repeatedly for women, including those she worked with. She had extended her support to Kangana Ranaut, an actress fighting for credit for a film she claimed she co-wrote.

Here's the clip.

If violent sexual assaults, coercion, blackmail, and toxic male aggression could be stopped at spaces occupied by women by not appearing ""vulnerable"" and ""desperate for a job"" or just by simply walking away, Balan would not have been on the panel talking about these issues.",Vidya Balan Says She Was Not Sexually Harassed At Work Because She 'Didn't Come Across As Vulnerable',http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/28/vidya-balan-says-she-was-not-sexually-harassed-at-work-because-she-didnt-come-across-as-vulnerable_a_23259204/

Zuvor hatte die spanische Staatsanwaltschaft Anklage gegen ihn und weitere Angehörige der abgesetzten Regionalregierung erhoben

Nach seiner Absetzung und einer Anklage wegen Rebellion ist der katalanische Regionalpräsident Carles Puigdemont nach Belgien gereist. Der Anführer der Unabhängigkeitsbewegung habe dort am Montag mit einem Anwalt gesprochen, berichtete die belgische Nachrichtenagentur Belga am Abend unter Berufung auf den Juristen.

Unklar blieb zunächst, ob der Katalane in Belgien Asyl beantragen will.

Der Chefkoordinator der Volkspartei (PP) des spanischen Ministerpräsidenten Mariano Rajoy, Fernando Martínez Maíllo, kommentierte die Medienberichte mit den Worten: ""Ja, das ist anscheinend bestätigt."" Die Flucht zeuge ""von Verzweiflung"", sagte er am Montag vor Journalisten in Madrid.

Anklage wegen Rebellion

Die spanische Staatsanwaltschaft hatte am Montag Anklage gegen Puigdemont und weitere Angehörige der abgesetzten Regionalregierung erhoben. Die Vorwürfe gegen die Angeklagten lauteten unter anderem auf Rebellion, Auflehnung gegen die Staatsgewalt und Unterschlagung öffentlicher Gelder, sagte Generalstaatsanwalt José Manuel Maza am Montag in Madrid.

Am Wochenende hatte Belgiens Staatssekretär für Asyl und Migration, Theo Francken, für Empörung gesorgt, weil er sein Land als möglichen Zufluchtsort für die abgesetzten Politiker ins Spiel brachte. Katalanen, die sich politisch verfolgt fühlten, könnten in Belgien um Asyl ansuchen, sagte der Flame dem flämischen Sender VTM News.

Der belgische Premierminister Charles Michel wies ihn laut Nachrichtenagentur Belga zurück: ""Ich bitte Theo Francken, kein Öl ins Feuer zu gießen.""

Hätte ein Asylantrag Puigdemonts Erfolg?

Ob ein Asylantrag Puigdemonts in Belgien Chancen hätte, gilt als sehr fraglich. Über den EU-Vertrag ist geregelt, dass sich die Mitgliedstaaten im Zusammenhang mit Asylangelegenheiten untereinander als sogenannte sichere Herkunftsländer betrachten - das heißt, es wird grundsätzlich davon ausgegangen, dass es in EU-Staaten keine Verfolgungsgefahr gibt.

Deshalb wurde festgelegt, dass der Asylantrag eines Staatsangehörigen eines Mitgliedstaats von einem anderen Mitgliedstaat nur unter ganz besondereren Bedingungen berücksichtigt werden darf.

Möglich wäre die Berücksichtigung des Asylantrages demnach nur dann, wenn Spanien unter Berufung auf einen Notstand die Verpflichtungen der Konvention zum Schutz der Menschenrechte und Grundfreiheiten aussetzen würde - oder wenn gegen das Land ein EU-Verfahren wegen des Verdachts auf schwerwiegende Verstöße gegen die Rechtsstaatlichkeit laufen würde.

Da beides nicht der Fall ist, müsste Belgien auf jeden Fall den Rat der EU-Mitgliedstaaten einschalten. Dieser dürfte wenig begeistert sein, wenn Belgien der spanischen Zentralregierung mit Asyl für Puigdemont in den Rücken fallen würde.

Bislang stehen die EU-Partner geschlossen hinter der Zentralregierung in Madrid, unter ihnen auch der belgische Premierminister Charles Michel, der nicht der flämischen Partei N-VA abgehört.

Coming out about your sexual assault is like joining the worst sisterhood ever.","Jillian Corsie had only been at college for a month when she says she was sexually assaulted by a male classmate in her dorm.

It was 2005 and the conversation about campus sexual assault still had another decade before it became part of the mainstream discussion.

When she turned to her friends for support, she says one suite-mate advised her not to tell their dorm room’s R.A; another let out a sigh of relief: “Thank God I wasn’t there or it would’ve happened to me.” Her boyfriend at the time later admitted that he thought Corsie had simply cheated on him and regretted it.

Corsie, who had turned 18 just a month before, went to local police for help.

“When I reported it to the police, they told me, quote, ‘not to mix alcohol and beauty’ and told me my experience was consensual,” Corsie told HuffPost in a recent interview.

For the remainder of her freshman year, Corsie says she was forced to see her assailant three times a week in the class in which they had met. The rest of her college career, she says, was spent avoiding her attacker on campus. She struggled with anxiety and feelings of isolation, barely talking about her assault even years after it happened.

“I didn’t have any support,” Corsie said.

Now, she’s using her expertise as a filmmaker to highlight the impact of victim-blaming in sexual assault cases. Corsie and co-director Amy Rosner are raising money to create a documentary-style short film called “Second Assault,” in which viewers follow Corsie as she travels back to her college campus and confronts the different people and road blocks she faced when she reported her assault 12 years ago.

“The film is about my journey to confront a system that failed me, and also to confront the culture that we live in,” Corsie said. “And how that supports this idea of a second assault, which isn’t necessarily just what happens when you report, but also what happens when your friends and boyfriends and people around you don’t believe you.”

The film is currently in production and Corsie and Rosner are awaiting more funding in order to complete it. As of Wednesday afternoon, the two had raised just over $9,000 on SeedAndSpark.

Jillian Corsie/Amy Rosner Jillian Corsie (L) and Amy Rosner (R).

Corsie and Rosner were inspired to create “Second Assault” after they heard the 2016 leaked audio of President Trump bragging about grabbing women “by the pussy.” Just days later, Corsie decided to publicly share her sexual assault story for the first time using the hashtag #NotOkay.

“I started getting contacted by news outlets and other documentary filmmakers asking to tell my #NotOkay story. I’m a documentary filmmaker and I knew that if anyone’s going to tell this story after a decade, it should be me,” Corsie said. “Amy and I had been friends already for a few years, and we’d been talking about collaborating and just never had. So she just naturally became my co-director.”

Rosner started her career as a union organizer, but quickly realized she could make a larger impact as a documentary storyteller.

“There was so much learning along the way,” Rosner told HuffPost about “Second Assault.” “We realized that Jill’s story, as personal as it is, it’s really a universal experience shared by a lot of women.”

HuffPost spoke with Corsie and Rosner about the creative process behind “Second Assault” and what they hope comes from such a personal film.

HuffPost: Why did you two decide to make this film?

Rosner: Something that we really wanted to highlight with this film is what does survivor justice look like? If you plagiarize, you’re more likely to get expelled than if you rape someone. So, when people make the argument that we need to depend on the “legal process” what they need to understand is that only three percent of rapists go to jail and it can take up to six years for a case to be tried. So students, like Jillian, are usually forced to spend the rest of their college careers with their rapists.

The system is broken at every single level. When people come out about their assaults, there’s so much personal and professional risk. Everyone’s afraid of retaliation. Jill was afraid that her school was going to come after her. We wanted to highlight just how many roadblocks survivors face when they come out.

What was it like ― 12 years later ― confronting the different people and roadblocks you faced in your reporting process?

Corsie: I mean, frankly, a year ago I would have told you that I would never have done any of this. It would’ve taken a whole bottle of vodka. I couldn’t tell you why but I had kept the business card of the cop who filed my report. I had considered calling and maybe trying to look at the report, and I had done that several times over the years, but I had always chickened out. I was just afraid that the report was going to tell me what everybody else told me, and that it was going to be one more thing that invalidated my experience. Now that it’s done it doesn’t seem like as big of a deal, but at the time it was really challenging.

This past year has been wrought with discussions around sexual violence including the Trump tapes, the Cosby trial and now the Harvey Weinstein allegations and the #MeToo campaign. What has that been like for you as a survivor?

Corsie: I think the #MeToo campaign has been really interesting because I think it shows survivors that they’re not alone. There’s something about these collective voices of women coming out and coming forward that is empowering. Without the #NotOkay campaign last year, I would never have spoken out, and I would never have gotten the opportunity to heal.

Something one of the women in our film says is, “Coming out about your sexual assault is like joining the worst sisterhood ever.” Right?

Rosner: Yeah. There’s so many shitty, shitty fucking sisterhoods that women join that are not choices, and this is one of them. So I think while, yes, #MeToo is a trigger-fest and it has been really tough for a lot of people to take, I agree with Jill. I think we have to practice revolutionary self-care right now and always.

I think the universal issue here is that there’s a deeper systemic problem within our culture that makes difficult for women to speak out publicly or see legal action. So seeing it in mass numbers like this, particularly men seeing this, I think has been a really helpful thing.

Coming out about your sexual assault is like joining the worst sisterhood ever. Jillian Corsie

How do you think that the reporting processes ― whether through Title IX or the justice system ― can improve to better support survivors?

Corsie: If we’re talking about, how do we make change on campus with Title IX, with the legal process outside of campuses, how do we actually make actual positive change? I don’t know. It’s systemically broken at every level.

Rosner: It’s just so absolutely depressing. There’s a systemic problem, and I think one of the major things that Jillian and I really believe in is the conversation around consent. A revolutionary start with this battle is how we talk about consent.

And involving men in that conversation is key.

Rosner: Yes! For Jill and I, we talk a lot about involving men in the conversation. In the beginning, it was really hard for Jill and I to talk about, and I think it is really triggering to even discuss including men, but then when you step back you go like, “Why would we not?”

First of all, why aren’t we talking about consent and what that really means? Why aren’t we educating people? People seem to be focusing so much time on educating our daughters about how not to get raped instead of talking to their sons about how not to rape. It starts with some kind of more profound sexual education.

Corsie: We keep saying rape is a woman’s issue, but it’s not: it’s a human issue.

What do you hope survivors take away from this film?

Corsie: The one thing that I would want survivors to take away is that we believe them. Because that’s the hardest part. The go-to response to any assault survivor ― male or female ― is: “We don’t believe you. Stop whining. It’s not that big of a deal.” Once people started believing me, that changed everything.

What do you hope men (although men can be survivors, too) take away from the film?

Rosner: I would hope that men take away that talking about consent is important. Because talking about this, let’s be honest, is really difficult, and there’s a lot of land mines. Consent is not taught to be a part of masculinity. Our goal is for men to see this film and feel that consensual sex can be empowering and masculine.

The 7-year-old from Nevada threw out the first pitch at the Game 4 of the World Series in Houston, Texas on Saturday. Dawson was born with Poland syndrome, a rare disorder that can cause underdevelopment and deformation in hands.

As a result, she uses a special 3D-printed robotic hand, which gives her the ability to do things like grasp and throw a ball.

Bob Levey via Getty Images Dawson was born with Poland syndrome, a rare disorder that can cause underdevelopment and deformation in hands.

The robotic hand is perfect for Dawson, who loves baseball. In fact, she has a special goal for her hand: to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at all 30 MLB ballparks.

A viral news story about her goal caused an outpouring of invitations from MLB teams all around the country. She’s thrown out the first pitch at Oriole Park, Nationals Park, and now Minute Maid Park.

On Saturday, Dawson added the World Series first pitch to her list of baseball milestones. Before the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers faced off, she pitched to Astros second baseman Jose Altuve.

Post-mortem evidence showed Wall was stabbed in her ribcage and genitals “around or shortly after her death.” The police said they would now extend the charges against Madsen - which already include murder and mutilating Wall’s body - to include sexual assault without intercourse, based on 14 interior and exterior stab wounds to the journalist’s genitals. “Kim Wall had suffered 14 stabs in and around the genitals and it is due to these stabs that we have said that there must have been a sexual motive,” police spokesman Jens Moller Jensen told journalists in Copenhagen. The cause of death was still unknown, said Jensen. Madsen, who had earlier claimed he dropped Wall off alive in Copenhage, also denies the sexual assault charges.

We should be having the discussion about bikinis and burqas.","""Women in the West are sexually exploited. They are portrayed indecently in their media.""

That's a paraphrase of the words printed on the inside cover of my Grade 5 school book in Iran. And while I don't recall the precise wording, the message made a lasting impression on me.

Even then, however, I did not buy into the conclusion that the note was asking us to draw: that the imposition of modest attire, including the hijab (not niqab or burqas) required by the Islamic Republic of Iran, were, therefore, more respectful to women than Western standards.

I instinctively felt that objectification of women in the West did not justify subjugation of women in the East.

What I read in that textbook in 1981, and what I had learned in Iran in many contexts, did contribute to my looking critically at how women were treated and sexualized in Western media and culture. And when I came to Canada with my family in 1983 at the age of 12, I could see, in ways that some of my peers could not, the impact of fashion magazines and the movie and television industries on girls' free will, on our conduct, and certainly on how we dressed.

As a result, every time we have a ""debate"" in this country about burqas or other religious garb (including the Quebec government's attempt to legislate ""social cohesion"" and equality through Bill 62), I recall that passage in the textbook. And I arrive at the same conclusion each time: what we need now is conversation, not coercion.

What could we discuss?

Neither system grants us women complete autonomy. And neither frees us from objectification or coercion.

Bikinis or burqas: is one a sign of greater emancipation and one a sign of greater oppression? Is it outrageous to ask the question?

There are vast differences between the institutions and value systems that permit or require these extremes. Still, neither system grants us women complete autonomy. And neither frees us from objectification or coercion.

Neither the protectionism of religion nor the liberation of secularism; neither the modesty of a long, flowing dress, nor the freedom to go shirtless on public streets; neither the building of a closer relationship to G-d, nor the legislation of gender equality; none of these have succeeded in granting women complete autonomy over our bodies and our choices.

None of these have freed us from sexual harassment and assault. None of these have stopped the rape of women and girls in war. None of these have stopped abusive marriages. None of these have stopped the trafficking of young girls and the marriage of young girls to much older men. None of these have placed us on an equal footing in high-powered jobs and in the boardroom.

I am not arguing that as a progressive, inclusive society, we should embrace or even permit all religious practices or restrictions. We do not and we must not. And I am not arguing that the political, religious and cultural institutions that permit bikinis or require burqas have equal impact on women's rights or even equal moral legitimacy. They do not.

But unlike theocracies or extreme interpretations of religion, progressive liberal democracies give us the freedom to engage in meaningful discussion instead of coercion. And that is precisely why the liberal democratic state should not overstep its role and irresponsibly legislate what women cannot wear.

Dialogue over dogma: we need to have an open, honest and civil discussion about bikinis, burqas and everything in between.

My views may seem irrelevant to some — after all, I am not even Muslim (I am Jewish) — so who am I to offer my opinion? Yet for years, I adhered to and internalized the Iranian State's values with regards to modesty, so much so that when we first arrived in Spain after leaving Iran, I refused to remove my hijab. In Canada, I resisted wearing shorts. And I did not wear a bikini until my late 20s. Many Jews, as well, adhere to a strict notion of modesty in dress. So I have had my own discussions about these complex issues, and have arrived at my own conclusions. I have clearly and consciously chosen progressive, liberal democracy, despite its shortcomings in achieving gender equality, over state-sanctioned or culturally imposed religious authority.

I know the undeniable value of discussion and citizen engagement in a robust democracy.

Dialogue over dogma: we need to have an open, honest and civil discussion about bikinis, burqas and everything in between. It is incumbent on us to have this conversation, for the sake of our democracy and the rights and freedoms we cherish. This is a discussion we need to have, before we think about whether there is a need or justification for a next step.

But the people having this discussion first should not be decision-makers who then impose broad discriminatory laws. They should be women, primarily. We should be having the discussion about bikinis and burqas. We — women — must engage in an open, meaningful exchange about our choices and challenges; societal and cultural pressures and freedoms; oppression and liberation; sexism and misogyny; and whether bikinis or burqas are appropriate in certain circumstances. We, including burqa-wearing women. We must make every effort to have respectful discussions in the absence of a sense of moral or religious superiority.

Through dialogue, understanding and mutual trust, we will achieve better social cohesion.

So when it comes to bikinis and burqas, let's seek conversation, not coercion.

A rapidly-growing snowball effect that began with allegations against Hollywood director Harvey Weinstein, before encompassing Labour MP Jared O’Mara and government minister Mark Garnier so far shows no sign of slowing down. HuffPost UK talked to a number of current and ex-staff members, from across the political spectrum, working within parties and for individual MPs, about their experiences and concerns. One former Labour special adviser told of a lewd advance made towards her by a still-serving Tory MP while on the Commons terrace one sunny afternoon. “Recent events have made me think a lot about some of the incidents I experienced,” she said. “One that sticks out is something that happened after I’d actually left politics, but I’d come back to Parliament for a meeting and I was on the terrace. It was a nice day, it must have been about 4pm, and they had brought the leftover sandwiches out from an event.

“A Tory MP walked over to my table, and said ‘I just want to see if the sex kitten wants any of my sandwiches’. He looked really proud of himself, like he was paying me a big compliment. “I was completely mortified, as were all the people I was with. I just said ‘no thanks’. I think he genuinely thought he was being lovely. “There were so many incidents like that - just examples of deeply, deeply outdated attitudes towards women.” The former staffer said on another occasion, a then-senior Labour cabinet minister made her feel “very uncomfortable” at a party conference event. “He kept going on and on about a blouse I was wearing, how it looked and the shape of it. It was just really awkward and he wouldn’t shut up about it. “These kinds of attitudes were just pervasive throughout politics. This idea that women were almost ornamental and you could speak to them in any way you liked.” MPs from across the Commons, including former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, leader of the House Andrea Leadsom and Tory backbencher Anna Soubry, have called for urgent action to be taken to address a “culture of sexual harassment” between members and their staff. Theresa May pledged to write to John Bercow, the Speaker of the House, to ask for his help in tackling the issue - but despite the PM’s tough talk, only a single minister has been placed under investigation.

Another former party staffer, who worked for Labour both in government and opposition, said: “I think the worst thing was being warned as young woman not to be in a car alone with certain ministers. “When I first got into politics, as a young researcher, older friends would warn you to make sure you weren’t alone with certain male politicians at conference parties.” One former researcher for a since-retired Tory MP told friends his boss “on more than one occasion asked if he would - ‘for fun’ - wear plastic breasts in the office and dance around.” Another former senior staff member said: “I once knew of an MP who had a work experience student staying at his flat. He actually got into this guy’s bed ‘for a cuddle’. “This sort of thing was totally ingrained in the culture. Probably still is.” A senior Lib Dem source confirmed the issues span the entire political spectrum and have done for several years. “The split in the Parliamentary party - when we had one - [on who to avoid] was always the God botherers and the women botherers,” they told HuffPost UK. Other current staff members, who asked not to be identified because of the potential impact on their careers, confirmed there had been little improvement in recent years. “We have all known for years which MPs to avoid, but I don’t think anyone will actually come forward and speak out about some of them,” one said.

PA Wire/PA Images

Responding to an urgent question tabled in the Commons on Monday afternoon, Leadsom said events in recent days were in danger of bringing Parliament into disrepute. The Leader of the House said Parliament needs a new independent body to protect MPs’ staff from abuse and unwanted attention. Speaker John Bercow agreed members needed to act “swiftly” to tackle what he branded a “disturbing” culture. But Baroness Anne Jenkin, who with Theresa May co-founded Women2Win, a campaign to increase the number of female Conservative MPs, cautioned against creating an environment where false allegations could be made. She told HuffPost UK: “Of course it is stating the obvious that unwanted sexual behaviour is unacceptable in any walk of life and must be stamped out. “However, I think there is a danger, in the current environment swirling with gossip and intrigue, of creating an atmosphere where people are afraid to say anything and just retreat into themselves, which would be really quite depressing. Or even that unsubstantiated allegations can be made without any proof. “I am not suggesting for one minute that there is not some behaviour that goes on that is beyond inappropriate. Properly predatory behaviour, grooming and such like, of young women and young men, has to be stamped out as a matter of urgency.”

PA Archive/PA Images

Jenkin, who has sat in the House of Lords since 2011, said the “vast majority” of incidents could be resolved “through people using common sense and good manners”. “This is a matter for Parliament to sort out and I look forward to seeing the Speaker’s response to the Prime Minister’s letter,” she added. ″I would be the first to come down on such behaviour like a tonne of bricks, if it were brought to my attention. Everyone knows I am hugely supportive of the Conservative women MPs and I am sure they, and I hope their staff, would come to me if there was a problem. Or someone else in authority who will take allegations seriously. “I have actually put out a message asking anyone to get in touch with me with any concerns, and so far nobody has.” But Unite, the union which represents hundreds of Parliamentary staff, said the issue could not be left to political parties alone to deal with. It urged any employee with concerns to get in touch with their union rep and said the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), the Commons watchdog, needed to do more to support its efforts.

Après avoir relancé ""Une famille en or"" avec son ""Family Battle"" fin septembre, il prépare une nouvelle émission pour C8. D'après les informations du Parisien dévoilées ce lundi 30 octobre, l'animateur de TPMP est en train d'adapter le programme ""Little Big Star"", émission qui met en avant des enfants et leur talent.

La comparaison avec ""L'école des fans"" de Jacques Martin tient par le seul fait que cette nouvelle émission fait intervenir des enfants de 5 à 13 ans. Les célèbres questions ""T'as quel âge?"", ""Et t'es venu avec tes parents?"", ""Et tu veux faire quoi plus tard?"" posées aux enfants ont été remaniées à la sauce Hanouna: ""T'es beau gosse. T'as une meuf?"", ""Quoi! T'as 16 de moyenne? Moi, quand tu additionnes toutes mes notes, ça ne fait pas autant"", rapporte le quotidien qui a pu assister à un enregistrement sur deux jours.

Adapté du programme américain ""Little Big Shots"" lancé en 2016 par Ellen DeGeneres et Steve Harvey, ""Little Big Stars"" arrive en France après avoir connu le succès à l'étranger, notamment en Australie, au Brésil, en Italie ou aux Philippines où l'émission était présentée par Billy Crawford. La première diffusion aura lieu en prime-time d'ici à la fin de l'année 2017.

""Pas de note, pas d'élimination""

La production artistique est assurée par le juré de ""Danse avec les stars"" Chris Marques qui donne des détails sur cette adaptation française et le choix des enfants sélectionnés pour leurs talents variés. ""On les a trouvés via des associations, des clubs ou sur YouTube, raconte Chris Marques. On en a d'abord sélectionné 150 pour n'en garder que 30, ceux qui avaient le plus de répartie"".

Les téléspectateurs pourront ainsi admirer un enfant doué aux échecs, un auteur-interprète, un champion de boxe et un autre de tennis de table, des imitateurs, des musiciens, un fan de reptiles... ""Il n'y a pas de jury, pas de note, pas d'élimination. Il y a juste des enfants exceptionnels qui sont là pour vous faire kiffer"", précise Cyril Hanouna au Parisien.

Si M6 était sur les rails pour adapter ce format et que Eric Antoine, le magicien juré de ""La France a un incroyable talent"", rêvait de le présenter, rapporte le journal, la production Warner a finalement misé sur Cyril Hanouna, récemment placé en queue d'un classement des animateurs préférés des Français.

""Cyril, c'est un gamin. Ça lui permet d'être à la hauteur des enfants et d'entrer facilement dans leur univers, explique au Parisien le producteur de Warner, Jean-Louis Blot. C'est le seul en France à pouvoir faire ça. Je connais vingt animateurs qui auraient pété les plombs. Avec cette émission, on va découvrir qui il est vraiment: un mec patient, attentif et généreux.

El último capítulo estrenado en la madrugada del domingo al lunes terminó con unos cuantos personajes de Alejandría recibiendo disparos y con la reaparición de un personaje que todo el mundo había olvidado hace tiempo: Morales (Juan Gabriel Pareja), del que no se ha sabido nada desde la primera temporada. Y regresa reteniendo a Rick a punta de cañón contra su cabeza. Pero, siendo realistas y teniendo en cuenta que la serie está siguiendo de forma aproximada la línea argumental del cómic en cuanto a la guerra contra Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a Rick probablemente no le va a pasar nada.

SPOILERS : si no quieres saber nada de lo que pasa en el segundo capítulo de la octava temporada de The Walking Dead , no sigas leyendo.

""No me da miedo ningún búho"", comenta Rick.

Morgan supera desde hace mucho el tiempo de descuento, ya que en el cómic hace tiempo que está muerto. En el último capítulo, Morgan dice ""Yo no muero"" justo antes de que su grupo ataque un puesto avanzado de los Salvadores, lo que significa básicamente que está muerto. Incluso hay un plano en el que, durante unos segundos, parece como si acabaran de matarle a tiros, aunque luego se ve que no le pasa nada.

El año pasado hubo mucho revuelo por la posible muerte de Carl, ya que Chandler Riggs anunció que iba a empezar la universidad. Y este año parece que podría llegar el momento temido.

Carl también aparece en la escena futura de Rick y, curiosamente, no asistió a la Comic-Con de Nueva York como parte del plantel de The Walking Dead. No es que eso sea un indicador, pero no deja de ser extraño. Además, en el estreno de la octava temporada, uno de los Salvadores le dice a Rick: ""Tu hijo morirá"".

¿Puede ser esa frase un presagio?

David Alpert responde al HuffPost: ""Llevamos tiempo demostrando que todos los personajes se la juegan y que somos la clase de serie que no tiene problema en desviarse de la línea argumental del cómic"".

Y va más allá: ""Hemos recibido mensajes de los fans diciendo: 'Como muera Daryl, nos rebelamos'. [...] Todavía seguimos recibiendo mensajes de personas que nos piden que resucitemos a Beth [Emily Kinney]. Hay muchísima gente que quiere a Emily y que la quiere ver de vuelta.

La verdad es que no tranquiliza mucho el hecho de que hayan grabado un plano nostálgico recreando la escena inicial de Rick en la serie.

Ya sé que hemos hablado de esto en Talking Dead, [...] pero sí, tiene el pelo largo, ha crecido y está un poco como una cabra"".

Et cela d'autant plus que certains profitent de la fragilité du deuil pour faire de bonnes affaires. Dans un rapport publié ce dimanche 29 octobre, l'association de consommateurs Familles Rurales, reconnue d'utilité publique, alerte sur les arnaques des frais d'obsèques.

L'association a fait réaliser 37 devis auprès d'entreprises de pompes funèbres de 13 départements différents, en demandant à chaque fois le tarif le moins cher. Résultat: pour une inhumation ces prix varient de 862,72€ à... 4582,92€, soit du simple au quintuple. Si les écarts sont plus resserrés pour les crémations, ils n'en restent pas moins eux aussi importants. Le coût peut ainsi tripler, de 1344€ à 4141,53€.

Derrière ces disparités se cachent des pratiques douteuses. 60% des devis réalisés étaient non conformes à la législation. Ils ne respectaient pas les contraintes de forme, mais présentaient aussi certaines prestations optionnelles comme obligatoires.

Ces différentes contraintes, qui visent à informer au mieux les familles en deuil, sont définies dans un arrêté ministériel du 23 août 2010. Le devis, écrit et gratuit, doit distinguer entre prestations obligatoires, optionnelles, et prestations pour le compte de tiers, notamment la représentation auprès des différentes administrations, rappelle Familles Rurales.

Les seules obligations, poursuit l'association, sont un cercueil avec quatre poignées, sans accessoires, ou une urne funéraire, la plaque d'identité, et l'opération d'inhumation ou de crémation.

Les devis les moins chers se font dans les boutiques d'entreprises locales

Or, certaines pompes funèbres profitent de la méconnaissance de leurs clients pour leur imposer différentes options. Il en va ainsi des soins de présentation ou de conservation du corps. Si les établissements de santé sont tenus de présenter un corps ""décent"", certaines entreprises n'en proposent pas moins des options de maquillage ou d'embaumement, qui peuvent alourdir la facture. De même, beaucoup proposent un transfert en chambre funéraire. Or, l'établissement où est mort le défunt prend en charge, gratuitement pour les trois premiers jours, le séjour en chambre mortuaire.

Les devis les moins chers sont ceux réalisés en boutique, et non pas sur internet. Ainsi, un devis réalisé en ligne présentera un prix en moyenne plus cher de 320€ pour un enterrement, et de 427,50€ pour une crémation.

Face aux grands groupes, les entreprises locales sont elles aussi plus compétitives, indique le rapport. Les tarifs des grands réseaux de pompes funèbres sont ainsi plus élevés de quelques 54€ en moyenne pour une crémation, et de plus de 393€ pour un enterrement.

L'association recommande ainsi de demander des devis à plusieurs entreprises, pour les mettre en concurrence. Elle indique aussi qu'il vaut mieux être accompagné, pour ne pas se laisser piéger par sa fragilité émotionnelle.

""Apprenez à résister au discours de commerciaux parfois peu scrupuleux"", conclut Familles Rurales, et ce même si ces conseillers peuvent paraître empathiques. Un conseil qui vaut de toute façon, précise l'association de consommateurs, ""quel que soit le domaine"".

Es ist Teil seines Lebens - auch im aktuellen politischen Konflikt.
2006 hatte Brühl die Hauptrolle in Manuel Huergas Film ""Salvador - Kampf um die Freiheit"".

Der deutsch-spanische Schauspieler Daniel Brühl (39, ""Der ganz große Traum"") spricht über seine Heimat, seine erste oder zweite, ganz wie man will. Er ist in Barcelona geboren und in Köln aufgewachsen. Er lebt in Berlin und Barcelona. Katalonien ist für ihn mehr als ein Rückzugsort. Es ist Teil seines Lebens - auch im aktuellen politischen Konflikt.

""Colonia Dignidad - Es gibt kein Zurück"" mit Daniel Brühl und Emma Watson können Sie hier auf DVD bestellen

In einem Beitrag für die ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"" schwärmt Brühl von seiner Heimatstadt: ""Ich habe hier als Kind gespielt und als Schauspieler gearbeitet. Ich habe hier Familienangehörige, Freunde, Schauspielerkollegen, Regisseure; hier spielt mein Klub, der FC Barcelona, im Camp Nou, dem besten Stadion der Welt. Barcelona war mein Zufluchtsort, vor allem in persönlichen Krisen"". Nun ist dieser Ort selbst in einer schlimmen Krise.

Er habe mit seiner Partnerin Felicitas Rombold Pläne geschmiedet, ganz nach Barcelona zu ziehen, ""erst recht, nachdem unser Sohn geboren wurde"". Aber nun falle es ihm schwerer, seit er ""fassungslos"" die Nachrichten in spanischen und deutschen Zeitungen lese, die davon handeln, dass Katalonien sich von Spanien abspalten will. Seitdem frage er sich, ""ob Barcelona das noch ist oder sein kann: Heimat. Oder ob man gerade dabei ist, mir etwas zu nehmen"".

Einer wie er, der ""dieses goldene, gleißende Licht der mediterranen Sonne"" über alles liebt, ""die offenherzigen Menschen, die Märkte, die Bars"", spüre nun, ""wie der Konflikt an mich heranreicht, wie ich in meinem ganz persönlichen Umfeld Gräben beobachte, die jeden Tag tiefer werden"".

""Ich habe mich immer als Europäer gefühlt""

Daniel Brühl ist wie viele andere Katalanen gegen die Abspaltung von Spanien, ""weil ich, Sohn eines Deutschen und einer Spanierin aus Barcelona, mich immer als Europäer gefühlt habe. Und weil mich das immun gemacht hat gegen die Engstirnigkeit, die ich jetzt in Katalonien wahrnehme"".

2006 hatte Brühl die Hauptrolle in Manuel Huergas Film ""Salvador - Kampf um die Freiheit"". Er spielte den jungen katalanischen Anarchisten Salvador Puig Antich, der gegen die spanische Franco-Diktatur gekämpft hatte und dafür 1974 hingerichtet wurde. Daniel Brühl schildert in seinem ""SZ""-Beitrag die Sympathien, die ihm in Barcelona entgegenströmten als der Film in die Kinos kam: ""Man identifizierte mich so sehr mit dem Protagonisten, dass ich damals in Barcelona fast nur auf Katalanisch angesprochen wurde. Ich kann mich noch gut erinnern, wie unwohl ich mich fühlte, wenn ich auf Spanisch antwortete"".

Er verstehe zwar Katalanisch ""perfekt"", doch es falle ihm schwer, Katalanisch zu sprechen. ""Das war auch nie ein Problem. Meine Gesprächspartner wechselten ins Spanische, wenn sie merkten, dass ich kein Katalanisch sprach"", so Brühl. In letzter Zeit sei es ihm aber passiert, ""dass Gesprächspartner ihr Katalanisch durchzogen, demonstrativ. Ich fürchte, das gehorcht einer Stimmung: Die da draußen gehören nicht zu uns. Das sind tendenziell Rechte"".

Es mache ihn fassungslos, wenn er höre, dass die Filmemacherin Isabel Coixet (57), eine linksorientierte Katalanin, ""auf der Straße als Faschistin beschimpft wurde, weil sie gegen die Unabhängigkeit ist"".

Aufgeheizte Stimmung innerhalb der Familie

Die Lage sei so aufgeheizt, dass es in seiner eigenen Familie auseinandergehe. ""Es gibt einige, die extrem für die Unabhängigkeit sind... Andere sind radikal dagegen. Im Freundeskreis ist es ähnlich, und ich ertappe mich dabei, wie ich dem Thema ausweiche, um Freundschaften nicht zu gefährden"", erklärt der Schauspieler.

Brühl hält das Referendum zur Unabhängigkeit für ""illegal"", für ""eine Farce"", weil es ""nicht mal den Mindestanforderungen an eine demokratische Abstimmung entsprach"". Er glaube nicht, dass die Mehrheit der Katalanen für eine Loslösung von Spanien sei. Doch jetzt, wo die Zentralregierung in Madrid die katalanischen Institutionen unter ihre Kontrolle stellen will, ""dürfte es wieder mehr Zulauf für jene geben, die sich abspalten wollen. Denn das verletzt die Katalanen in ihrem Stolz"", gibt Brühl zu bedenken.",Daniel Brühl: Wie sein spanisches Herz leidet,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/30/daniel-bruhl-wie-sein-spanisches-herz-leidet_n_18420124.html

Selon M. Vazquez-Levi, les deux partis ont manqué une asoirée tre opportunité de cibler des électeurs avec des campagnes géolocalisées sur Google.","Les deux principaux partis montréalais ignoreraient d'importants outils de marketing numérique dans le cadre de la campagne électorale municipale. Même Denis Coderre, roi incontesté des relseaux sociaux, laisserait à désirer.

La firme AOD Marketing a analysé les outils numériques utilisés par Équipe Denis Coderre et Projet Montréal. Constat: internet est sous-exploité.

«Aujourd'hui, les Canadiens passent en moyenne 5h49 par jour sur internet depuis leur PC ou tablette et 1h42 depuis leur cellulaire, c'est majeur», note Augustin Vasquez-Levi, président et fondateur d'AOD Marketing.

Égalité sur Facebook?

Un premier constat surprenant se dégage de l'analyse: malgré une large avance dans le nombre d'abonnés sur Facebook, les publications de Denis Coderre rejoignent le même nombre d'utilisateurs que celles de Valérie Plante. La portée de M. Coderre et son parti se situerait entre 1300 et 6300 internautes alors qu'ils sont suivis par 48 500 personnes. Avec 27 000 abonnés au profil et la page professionnelle de Valérie Plante ainsi qu'à la page de Projet Montréal, l'aspirante-mairesse arrive à rejoindre entre 1400 et 4500 internautes.

Le rapport n'offre pas d'explication pour cette faible performance, mais noté qu'aucun des deux candidats nla fait de campagne sponsorisée ciblée sur Facebook, c'est-à-dire des campagnes publicitaires visant les internautes selon leur code postal.

«Ça permet de comprendre le discours dans chaque arrondissement et avoir une campagne spécifique à chaque région», note M. Vazquez-Levi.

En 2015, le quotidien The Gazette a analysé les tweets de M. Coderre et noté là aussi que la porte le du maire était faible malgré ses 219 000 abonnés (308 000 aujourd'hui). Selon le journal, ce résultat s'explique par le fait que les deux tiers des comptes Twitter qui suivent le maire sont faux ou inactifs, une proportion bien plus élevée que d'autres politiciens.

Quant à Mme Plante, elle a fait l'erreur d'avoir à la fois un profil personnel et une page professionnelle sur Facebook.

«Avoir un profil personnel et une page publique dilue la performance de ses publications et éparpille ses suiveurs potentiels», lit-on dans l'analyse de AOD Marketing.

Publicités Google

M. Coderre est le seul à avoir lancé des campagnes payantes sur Google jusqu'à présent. Au début de la période électorale, le site web de son parti était même les premier résultat à sortir lorsqu'on entrait «Projet Montréal» dans le moteur de recherche.

AOD Marketing estime que Projet Montréal aurait eu tout intérêt la mener une telle campagne publicitaire étant donné le manque de notoriété de sa chef, Valérie Plante.

«À noter que le Facebook de Valérie Plante est recherché sur Google. [...] Ceci est symptomatique d'un manque de notoriété sur le web», note la firme.

M. Coderre aurait toutefois pu faire mieux. Entre autres, il a payé pour que le site de son parti apparaisse en premier dans les recherches Google portant sur son nom alors qu'il était déjà bien référencé.

Selon M. Vazquez-Levi, les deux partis ont manqué une asoirée tre opportunité de cibler des électeurs avec des campagnes géolocalisées sur Google.

À l'heure où les intentions de vote sont annoncées comme quasi-identiques, une campagne numérique aurait définitivement permis à nos candidats d'avoir une plus grande visibilité web et, peut-être, faire la différence», conclut l'analyse.

Le HuffPost Québec a demandé à Projet Montréal et Équipe Denis Coderre pourquoi ils n'avaient pas investi davantage dans le numérique. Au moment d'écrire ces lignes, ils n'avaient pas envoyé de réponse.

La legge di bilancio approda al Senato, dove martedì inizierà il suo iter, e nella versione ufficiale, bollinata dalla Ragioneria generale dello Stato, figurano alcune novità, come la proroga per due anni della cedolare secca per gli affitti al 10%, che però non sarà strutturale. I gruppi parlamentari avranno tempo fino al 10 novembre per presentare le proprie proposte di modifica e non sono esclusi correttivi da parte del Governo alla luce del forte pressing di Mdp e dei sindacati. Il partito di Bersani e Speranza spinge in particolare per l'abolizione del superticket sanitario di 10 euro, mentre Cgil, Cisl e Uil chiedono lo stop dell'aumento automatico dell'età pensionabile.

La platea dei beneficiari degli 80 euro si fa più larga

Si allarga la platea del bonus Irpef da 80 euro. La versione finale della legge di bilancio, approdata in Senato, prevede infatti l'innalzamento delle soglie di reddito per ottenere la maggiorazione in busta paga: il tetto di 24.000 euro sale a 24.600 e quello di 26.000 sale a 26.600 euro. Sarebbero così salvi gli 80 euro dei dipendenti pubblici, che con il rinnovo del contratto supererebbero la soglia ad oggi vigente per ricevere il bonus.

La cedolare secca per gli affitti al 10% prorogata per il 2018-2019 ma non sarà strutturale

Non sarà stabilizzata, ma arriva una proroga di due anni per la cedolare secca al 10% che si applica sui contratti concordati. Le bozze circolate nei giorni scorsi prevedevano invece una stabilizzazione a regime di questo meccanismo. Ora invece la norma prevede che si possa applicare ""dal 2014 al 2019"", con una estensione quindi anche al prossimo biennio. Restano esclusi dalla misura uffici e negozi.

L'aumento dell'Iva rinviato al 2019

Rimodulato e rinviato al 2019 l'aumento dell'Iva. Il testo definitivo della manovra conferma la sterilizzazione delle clausole di salvaguardia per il 2018, ma rimanda l'aggravio all'anno successivo. In particolare, l'aliquota Iva al 10% salirà di 1,5 punti percentuali dal 2019 e di altri 1,5 punti dal 2020, mentre quella al 22% aumenterà di 2,2 punti percentuali dal 2019, di ulteriori 0,7 punti percentuali dal 2020 e di 0,1 punti dal 2021. Confermato l'aumento delle accise dal 2019.

Raddoppia la tassa per i licenziamenti, fino a 2.940 euro

Aumenta l'importo della ""tassa sui licenziamenti"" collettivi che le imprese industriali e commerciali con più di 50 dipendenti versano per la cassa integrazione. Per ogni persona interessata a un licenziamento collettivo il datore di lavoro dovrà versare un'aliquota pari all'82% del massimale della Naspi mensile (l'indennità di disoccupazione ndr), a fronte del 41% attuale, fino a un massimo di tre anni di anzianità. In pratica se adesso per ogni persona licenziata si pagava al massimo 1.470 euro adesso la tassa potrà arrivare all'82% e sfiorare i 2.940 euro.

Sgravio fiscale per le fondazioni bancarie

Arriva il credito d'imposta per le fondazioni bancarie per promuovere progetti di welfare. Il testo definitivo della manovra prevede un contributo, sotto forma di credito d'imposta, pari al 65% delle erogazioni effettuate a partire dall'anno d'imposta 2018, che può essere utilizzato solo nell'ambito dell'attività non commerciale. Il contributo è di 100 milioni l'anno, per il triennio 2019-2021, ed è assegnato in base all'ordine temporale con cui le fondazioni comunicano all'Acri l'impegno a effettuare le erogazioni.

Sconti per gli abbonamenti di bus e treni fino a 250 euro

Detrazioni fino a 250 euro per le spese d'abbonamento di trasporti pubblici locali, regionali e interregionali. Tra le novità anche l'agevolazione per gli accordi di rimborso di questi abbonamenti da parte dei datori di lavoro per i propri dipendenti e per i loro familiari - una sorta di ""bonus bus-treno"" - che non entrano a far parte del reddito da lavoro tassato.

Un Fondo da 100 milioni per la famiglia

Arriva il fondo da destinare a interventi per le politiche della famiglia con una dotazione di 100 milioni di euro l'anno a partire dal 2018. Il Fondo è istituito nello stato di previsione del ministero dell'Economia.

Bond cuscinetto per attutire i colpi delle crisi bancarie

Arriva una nuova classe di bond che vengono coinvolti prima delle obbligazioni senior in caso di crisi bancarie. L'introduzione, anche prima che sia adottata la nuova direttiva Ue (Brrd2), dei nuovi strumenti ""di debito chirografario di secondo livello"" è confermata nel testo finale della legge di Bilancio, dove invece non compare più il pacchetto di misure per accelerare lo smaltimento degli Npl. I nuovi bond cuscinetto devono avere durata minima di 12 mesi e non possono essere collegati a derivati e devono avere valore nominale di almeno 250mila euro. Possono essere emessi anche dalle Sim. L'obiettivo è quello, in caso di bail in, di dotare le banche di una maggiore capacità di assorbire le perdite, limitare l'intervento pubblico e dare ulteriore protezione a risparmiatori e depositanti in caso di crisi bancarie.

Fondi per il post terremoto, da L'Aquila a Ischia

Dieci milioni di contributo straordinario per l'Aquila per il sisma del 6 aprile 2009, altri 2 milioni agli altri Comuni del cratere. Vengono anche prorogate a tutto il 2019 le zone franche urbane create in Emilia e Lombardia dopo il terremoto del 20 e 29 maggio 2012 e per le stesse aree lo stop al pagamento dell'Imu sugli immobili in agibili è prorogato a tutto il 2018.

Diverse misure anche per facilitare i mutui per la ricostruzione. Confermata l'istituzione di un fondo da 10 milioni per il 2018, che salgono a 20 per il 2019 e 2020, per la ricostruzione di Casamicciola Terme e Lacco Ameno a Ischia.

Rinvio di un anno per l'Iri, vale quasi 2 miliardi per il 2018

Rinvio di 1 anno dell'Iri l'imposta al 24% sul reddito per le ditte individuali e per le società di persona a contabilità ordinaria, che doveva valere dall' 2017, quindi sulle prossime dichiarazioni dei redditi. La misura è confermata nel testo finale della legge di bilancio e, come si legge nella relazione tecnica, 'vale' quasi 2 miliardi (1,986) tra Irpef e le addizionali regionali e comunali.

Nasce l'Agenzia nazionale ItaliaMeteo, la sede a Bologna

La manovra istituisce l'Agenzia nazionale per la meteorologia e climatologia denominata 'ItaliaMeteo' con sede centrale a Bologna. L'Agenzia, tra gli altri compiti, dovrà elaborare, sviluppare, realizzare e distribuire prodotti e servizi ""per la previsione, valutazione, monitoraggio e sorveglianza meteorologica e meteo-marina, l'omogeneizzazione dei linguaggi e dei contenuti, anche ai fini di una efficace informazione alla popolazione"".

Il reddito di inclusione sale fino a 534 euro al mese per le famiglie numerose

Potenziate le misure per la lotta alla povertà: cresce la platea dei beneficiari del Rei, il reddito di inclusione, che per le famiglie numerose sale fino a 534 euro al mese.

In particolare, si legge nella relazione tecnica, per i nuclei con 5 o più componenti, gli unici per i quali è previsto un beneficio potenziale sopra il massimale, la misura aumenta il contributo massimo dagli attuali 485,41 euro mensili fino a circa 534 euro. Il costo dell'intervento sale di 60 milioni di euro l'anno, con un aumento di circa il 16% rispetto ai 370 milioni stimati per i nuclei con 5 o più a legislazione vigente. L'incremento del massimale comporta anche un lieve ampliamento della platea di beneficiari che, per questa tipologia, passano da 100,1 mila a 106 mila, mentre nel complesso i beneficiari potenziali del ReI si attestano a 499,8 mila.

Iva al 10% per i concerti

At the 2017 election, a record 208 women MPs were elected, but still make up barely a third of the total. Normally men dominate proceedings in the Commons, as just 21% of Tories and 45% of Labour MPs are female. But on Monday, all that changed as women packed the chamber and men turned up in noticeably fewer numbers. Early in proceedings, HuffPost UK counted 65 women and just 56 men in the Commons, giving female Parliamentarians a rare majority. More than a third of Tory MPs present for the Urgent Question – tabled by Labour’s Harriet Harman - were women, way above their usual percentage. Commons Leader Leadsom was flanked by Theresa May and a trio of women - Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the PM’s Parliamentary Private Secretary Seema Kennedy, and Mims Davies – sat behind them.

But gaps in the green benches were apparent and by the end of the 75-minute session, there were few Tory MPs left present. Later in the Urgent Question, the gender balance was even more stark. On the Labour benches, women eventually outnumbered male colleagues by two to one (35 women to just 16 men on the green benches). Labour MP Jess Phillips revealed that just before the debate, a pair of her colleagues had not been as gripped of its importance as she was. “As I walked in here, as I rushed in here today to come to this statement, I overheard two male colleagues walking through the halls wittering about a witch hunt that was going on in Parliament,” she said.",Women MPs Outnumber Men During Commons Sex Harassment Debate,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/women-mps-outnumber-men-during-sex-harassment-debate_uk_59f77941e4b09b5c2568457b?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) from “Stranger Things” may be the father of Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz) from “Parks and Recreation.”

BEN SCHWARTZ REJECTEDJOKES

Keery recently told HuffPost he was getting compared to Schwartz long before “Stranger Things” ever came out, so he wasn’t surprised by the theory. But the internet’s reaction, which has even led to Keery and Schwartz appearing in viral videos and Visa ads together, has been out of control, despite a relatively small amount of evidence.

Thus far, the biggest support for the theory has been Keery and Schwartz’s similar looks, the fact that both shows take place in Indiana, and that Steve could technically, timing-wise, become Jean-Ralphio’s papa.

Now, it looks like “Stranger Things” Season 2 may be adding even more evidence, and it appears to come down to this scene:

After watching the new season, we noticed Steve seems to struggle a bit on the basketball court.

Following in his (possible) father’s footsteps, Jean-Ralphio is no stranger to similar difficulties.

Keery calls the pair’s basketball “skills” a possible Season 2 clue about the theory.

“I think the basketball is the only hint, I would say,” Keery told us after being asked if he had noticed any other connections to Jean-Ralphio in Season 2. He added, “But if that’s the case, in real life Ben is an absolute, great basketball player. He has got a nice, sweet jump shot.”

If that isn’t enough for all the theory enthusiasts, the actor went on to joke that originally Season 2 went even more in-depth on his character’s family history.

“There was this entire plotline of the conception and the birth of Jean-Ralphio, but they just had to cut that for time, so hopefully they can fit that in next season,” said Keery.

He and his followers had rented a house in the Florida countryside for security reasons, they said. A hotel in Gainesville wasn’t an option.

After driving down dirt roads, HuffPost found Spencer standing in the dark, smoking a cigar and drinking Angel’s Envy bourbon out of a tall glass. Behind him, about a dozen of his followers filtered in and out of the house’s front door.

It looked as though maybe they were having a small party. Just 14 hours to go until Spencer, their movement’s figurehead, took the stage at the University of Florida in an elaborate and expensive troll aimed at spreading their rebranded version of organized racism.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Richard Spencer is interviewed by the HuffPost in a remote location outside Gainesville, Florida, on Oct. 18.

Spencer, president of the innocent-sounding National Policy Institute, which is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, was a top-billed speaker at the right-wing rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. That event spiraled into violence and ended with a neo-Nazi driving his car into counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

Spencer has since been on a mission to give speeches at multiple universities, threatening schools with lawsuits if they don’t allow him. This has left college towns across the country scrambling to make sure they don’t become the next Charlottesville.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Richard Spencer says he supports the push for white identity but doesn't want to be called a Nazi.

In a 20-minute interview with HuffPost, Spencer balked at being called a Nazi, was unapologetic about essentially forcing the University of Florida to spend over half a million dollars in security costs, extolled the virtues of a white “ethno-state,” explained why he’s targeting universities for recruitment and blamed violence at white supremacist events on counter-protesters.

“I mean, the only people who would do something that would — engage in violence or try to disrupt something or to harm anyone, are these counter-protesters and detractors,” Spencer told HuffPost when talking about the University of Florida event.

The next day, about an hour after Spencer left the stage at the university’s Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, three of his fans were seen driving through town. Police say they screamed “Heil Hitler!” and other chants at a group of counter-protesters.

Gainesville Police Department Colton Fears, left, Tyler Tenbrink and William Fears were arrested after Richard Spencer spoke at the University of Florida. One of the men is accused of firing a gun at a counter-protester.

When a counter-protester hit their vehicle with a baton, police said, the three men got out of the vehicle. “Kill them,” “Shoot them” and “I’m going to fucking kill you,” two of the men screamed.

Police said the third man lifted a gun and fired it at a counter-protester. The bullet missed.

Il semble que Fortin a mal compris l'intention derrière la blague de McSween, et que ce dernier voulait remettre les pendules à l'heure avec sa publication Facebook.","Lors de son passage à l'émission Deux hommes en or vendredi, Virginie Fortin s'en est pris à Pierre-Yves McSween, qui avait fait une blague qu'elle a jugé déplacée lors de la réunion d'humoristes pour décider de l'avenir de Juste pour rire lundi dernier.

Alors que Virginie abordait le sens de l'humour parfois douteux d'Éric Salvail, elle est revenue sur un «exemple très concret qui a eu lieu cette semaine.»

«Pierre-Yves McSween monte sur scène et vient faire un exposé sur combien vaut Juste pour rire, et la vérité c'est que moi je m'en torche un petit peu parce que j'ai un profond désir qu'on ouvre la discussion sur les relations entre les hommes et les femmes et les comportements déplacés, et un humoriste lève la main et dit «Moi, je ne connais rien à la comptabilité, c'est ma blonde qui s'occupe de ça à la maison.» Et Pierre-Yves McSween de dire «tu feras attention!» Et vois-tu? Ça c'est une blague, et je ne veux pas condamner personne pour une blague, mais on leur donne des avertissements, on leur dit que ce n'était peut-être pas le timing idéal pour faire une blague qui diminue clairement... Bon.»

Virginie Fortin dit que si elle aussi fait des blagues inappropriées parfois, elle trouve qu'il est temps qu'elle s'élève au-dessus de ça, et que l'industrie fasse de même. Elle laisse entendre que les blagues sexistes sont souvent trop faciles à faire.

Le comptable a trouvé déplorable la réaction de l'humoriste par rapport à sa blague. Dans une longue publication Facebook, il explique qu'il n'a pas voulu être sexiste. «Quand quelqu'un me dit ""Moi, je ne m'occupe pas des finances à la maison, je laisse tout à ma conjointe"", je trouve que c'est un comportement irresponsable et une mauvaise gestion des risques. Non pas parce que le (la) conjoint(e) est une femme, mais parce qu'on ne devrait jamais laisser 100% du contrôle à l'autre sans y accorder un minimum de suivi ou d'importance» a-t-il écrit. «Alors, quand j'ai répondu à l'humoriste ""tu feras attention"", avec le sourire, c'était une blague imprégnée d'un message très sérieux du point de vue des finances personnelles. Tout déléguer à son conjoint est une erreur, c'est même carrément une mauvaise idée. Si l'humoriste avait eu un homme comme conjoint, j'aurais fait la même blague, avec le même ton. Si une femme avait dit ""je délègue tout à mon conjoint"" j'aurais fait de même. Pour une fille qui a été porte-parole pour des publicités de Desjardins, je trouve cela bien triste de constater que tu ne comprends pas cette nuance», explique-t-il.

McSween n'a pas aimé la réaction de Virginie Fortin en ondes. «Me traiter de sexiste en pleine télévision pour cette réponse, c'est non seulement démontrer du mépris, mais aussi du sexisme. C'est prendre pour acquis que ma réponse aurait été différente pour une femme qui aurait dit la même chose d'un homme. Je trouve ces propos non seulement blessants, mais inappropriés» écrit-il.

De plus, McSween explique que cette rencontre était privée et qu'il est venu pour donner un coup de main d'un point de vue fiscal. «Quand, de mon côté, je prends ma journée pour vous aider, la dernière chose à laquelle je m'attends est de me faire manquer de respect par la suite», explique-t-il.

Sehr gehr geehrter Herr Regierender Bürgermeister,

es gibt Interviews, die liest man und vergisst sie sofort wieder. Und es gibt Interviews, die einen nachdenklich stimmen und im Kopf bleiben. Ihr Interview mit der Berliner Zeitung vom 25. Oktober 2017 hat mich nicht nur nachdenklich gestimmt - es ist an Frechheit nicht zu überbieten!



""Billige Effekthascherei und Polemik"" ist es definitiv nicht, wenn man die anhaltenden Zustände in vielen Bereichen der Stadt kritisiert. ""Billige Effekthascherei und Polemik"" ist es vielmehr, sein eigenes Scheitern als Regierender Bürgermeister unserer Stadt als Erfolg zu verkaufen. Doch natürlich hat auch Berlin ‚Erfolgsgeschichten' vorzuweisen und darauf dürfen wir auch stolz sein!

Sie und Ihre Politik sind Teil des Problems, das bei vielen Menschen zu einem verlorenen Vertrauen in die Politik beiträgt

Der in der Wissenschaft von Ihnen beschriebenen ‚überall bestaunten Entwicklung' der vergangenen Jahre steht eine allgemeine Fehlentwicklung gegenüber, die Sie als ""Privatbürger"" schon lange leider nicht mehr sehen.



Es ist keine Leistung, dass Frau Scheeres für genügend neue Lehrkräfte gesorgt hat, sondern ihre Pflicht als Senatorin. Punkt! Ob sie diese Pflicht rechtzeitig und in genügendem Maß erfüllt hat, soll jeder für sich selbst entscheiden. Doch selbst wenn die Lehrer - zumeist Quereinsteiger - jetzt in den überfüllten, maroden Klassenzimmern stehen, landet unsere Stadt noch immer auf dem letzten Platz in allen Bildungsvergleichen.

Die Ansiedlung des Internet-Instituts macht es auch nicht wieder gut, dass mit dem Bau von bezahlbarem Wohnraum unter einer Senatorin Lompscher noch nicht einmal begonnen wurde - stattdessen holt sie Stasi-Spezi Holm immer wieder in ihr Team, dessen Expertise bislang keine notwendige Wohnung hat entstehen lassen. Der Gast-Dozent, der in die Wissenschaftsstadt Berlin kommt und keine Wohnung findet, wird sich freuen.

Sie verkennen, dass es nicht um ""da werden wir noch besser"" oder ""Schritt für Schritt merken es die Bürger"" geht. Sie und Ihre Politik sind Teil des Problems, das bei vielen Menschen zu einem verlorenen Vertrauen in die Politik beiträgt.

Seit Jahrzehnten regiert Ihre SPD unsere Stadt, die für viele Menschen leider mittlerweile gefühlt ein ""failed state"" ist. Es ist polemisch, wenn man diesen Eindruck nicht durch politisches Handeln entkräftet und bei den Wartezeiten in den Ämtern von ""immerhin halbiert"" spricht.

Sie sind ein politischer Hütchenspieler



Illegale Müllberge auf den Straßen, ein völlig desaströser Justiz-Apparat, eine nicht funktionierende Verwaltung, Armutsmigration aus Osteuropa, die die zuständigen Bezirke nicht allein lösen können und selbst Grüne-Bezirksbürgermeister aus der Not heraus mittlerweile zu politischen Hardlinern werden lässt.

Eine hohe Zahl an Einbrüchen am Stadtrand und tausende, schlecht ausgestattete und bezahlte Polizeibeamte, die zusehen können, wie ihre Kollegen im Nachbarland Brandenburg bereits seit Monaten die versprochene moderne Anti-Terror-Ausrüstung bekommen haben. Ja, es ist richtig, dass die Polizei nicht alles regeln kann, was Sie und Ihr Senat kaputt gemacht haben!

Sie sagen, alles, was hier funktioniert, ist für Deutschland ein Impuls - das ist nur leider nicht unsere Stadt, die wir lieben und mit deren Scheitern in so vielen Bereichen wir tagtäglich leben müssen.

Das merken die Menschen nicht zuletzt gerade bei Tegel: ein SPD-naher Gutachter, der den BER genehmigt hat, soll jetzt neutral entscheiden, ob der Flughafen Tegel offenbleibt. Merken Sie es eigentlich selbst noch, Herr Regierender Bürgermeister?

Sie ändern das Verfahren, ohne mit der Wimper zu zucken. Sie führen eine Entscheidung in der Sache im Abgeordnetenhaus herbei, obwohl diese Sachfrage längst von einer Mehrheit von knapp einer Millionen Menschen, verbunden mit einem klaren Auftrag zur Offenhaltung von TXL beantwortet wurde.

Um es mit den Worten Ihres Kollegen Raed Salehs zu sagen: Sie sind ein politischer Hütchenspieler. Ein politischer Hütchenspieler, der meint, mit einer arroganten Geste diesen klaren Sachauftrag der Berlinerinnen und Berliner einfach wegwischen zu können.



Diesen Auftrag haben Sie Ihnen nicht zuletzt auch gegeben, weil in der Luftfahrt keiner an Ihre Kompetenz glaubt, den BER zu eröffnen und den Luftverkehrsstandort Berlin zu stärken. Die Verantwortung im Aufsichtsrat haben Sie ja bereits abgegeben. Den Arbeitsnachweis Ihrer SPD-Regierungszeit dürfen jetzt nicht zuletzt die Mitarbeiter von Air Berlin erleben.

Als Bundesratspräsident wollen Sie ""Berlin als Brennpunkt solcher Entwicklungen"" einbringen. Meinen Sie damit die Brennpunkte Tiergarten, Kottbuser Tor oder Hermannplatz? Meinen Sie den Brennpunkt Schulen? Meinen Sie den Brennpunkt Verwaltung? Welchen der vielen Brennpunkte meinen Sie?



Damit Ihre Zeit als Regierender Bürgermeister nicht als Brennpunkt unserer Stadtgeschichte in eben diese eingeht, sollten Sie endlich die großen Probleme unserer Stadt angehen - oder Ihren Platz für einen fähigeren Kollegen freimachen.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Sebastian Czaja

Τόσο ο ίδιος ο Τραμπ όσο και η εκπρόσωπος του Λευκού Οίκοι, προσπάθησαν να κρατήσουν αποστάσεις από τους δύο άνδρες, τον Πολ Μάναφορτ, πρώην διευθυντή της προεκλογικής εκστρατείας του προέδρου των ΗΠΑ, και τον ομογενή Τζορτζ Παπαδόπουλο.

Οι παραπομπές δύο πρώην συμβούλων του Ντόναλντ Τραμπ δεν έχουν καμία σχέση με τον πρόεδρο ή την προεκλογική εκστρατεία του και δεν αποδεικνύουν κάποια αθέμιτη σύμπραξη μεταξύ του επιτελείου του και της Ρωσίας, υποστήριξε ειδικότερα η εκπρόσωπος του Λευκού Οίκου, Σάρα Σάντερς.

«Το δηλώνουμε αυτό από την πρώτη ημέρα ότι δεν υπάρχουν αποδείξεις για αθέμιτη σύμπραξη μεταξύ του Τραμπ και της Ρωσίας και τίποτα στη σημερινή παραπομπή δεν το άλλαξε όλο αυτό», είπε κατά την τακτική ενημέρωση των δημοσιογράφων.

Η εκπρόσωπος υποστήριξε ότι ο ρόλος του δικηγόρου Τζορτζ Παπαδόπουλος στην προεκλογική εκστρατεία ήταν «εξαιρετικά περιορισμένος» καθώς κατείχε μόνο μια «θέση εθελοντή». Όπως ανέφερε, όποια δράση και αν ανέλαβε ο Παπαδόπουλος, ο οποίος ομολόγησε ότι έδωσε ψευδή κατάθεση στο FBI, το έκανε με δική του πρωτοβουλία.

Η Σάντερς διαβεβαίωσε ότι ο πρόεδρος Τραμπ «δεν έχει καμία πρόθεση» να αμφισβητήσει τον ειδικό εισαγγελέα και πρώην διευθυντή του FBI Ρόμπερ Μιούλερ ο οποίος απήγγειλε κατηγορίες σε βάρος των πρώην συμβούλων του. Τέλος, η Σάντερς αρνήθηκε να κάνει οποιοδήποτε σχόλιο όταν ρωτήθηκε αν θα μπορούσε να απονεμηθεί χάρη στους πρώην συνεργάτες του προέδρου.



Τραμπ: «ΚΑΜΙΑ ΣΥΝΩΜΟΣΙΑ!»

Ο Τραμπ αντέδρασε μέσω twitter λέγοντας ότι δεν υπήρξε «καμία συνωμοσία» μεταξύ της ομάδας του και της Ρωσίας.

«Δεν υπάρχει ΚΑΜΙΑ ΣΥΝΩΜΟΣΙΑ!», έγραψε. «Λυπάμαι, αυτά συνέβησαν πριν από χρόνια, προτού ο Πολ Μάναφορτ συμμετάσχει στην εκστρατεία Τραμπ. Γιατί η διεφθαρμένη Χίλαρι και οι Δημοκρατικοί δεν βρέθηκαν στο στόχαστρο;» συμπλήρωσε ο Τραμπ.

Ο Αμερικανός πρόεδρος υποστήριξε ότι τα όσα καταλογίζονται στον Μάναφορτ εκτυλίχθηκαν πριν από τη θητεία του στην προεκλογική εκστρατεία του Τραμπ το 2016, ωστόσο στο κατηγορητήριο αναφέρεται ότι οι παράνομες δραστηριότητές του συνεχίστηκαν το 2017.

It's pretty much a win win win win win.
Let me know if the tempeh ""sausage"" passes the test.
Combine all tempeh sausage ingredients (except tempeh) into a small bowl.
When your sauce is the desired consistency, add the tempeh sausage to the sauce.","I'm slowly making my way through the list of requests my readers sent in and I have to say thank you again because it has been inspiring some major creativity and new ideas in the kitchen. This Spicy Italian ""Sausage"" Pasta hits two birds with one stone with the ask for more dinner recipes and more plant-based protein options!

Growing up, my mom used to always make us her famous Spicy Italian Sausage Penne Pasta, inspired by the Bread Garden and man, was it good! To this day, it's still one of the family favourites in the rotation when we all go home to visit. There's just something so comforting about a warm bowl of pasta, and of course, the table full of good conversation and family love doesn't hurt either.

While I do still love my mom's original recipe, I've been playing around a lot with tempeh lately and got the idea to try substituting the sausage for a meat-free version. It's taken a couple of tries to get it just right but I think I've found the winning combo!

I just got to Hawaii yesterday (woohoo!) to visit my sister and they've been trying out a more plant-based diet, so I'm really excited to make this for them and see if it passes the three-year-old test...

I love tempeh as a plant-based protein substitute because it's also a great source of fibre and it's got the gut-healthy benefits of probiotics. It's pretty much a win win win win win.

This one's definitely going to be on repeat this fall and winter in our house. It's super easy to throw together, so enjoy it for a Sunday dinner or treat yourself any night of the week!

I know this recipe looks a lot longer than what I usually share but the steps really are quite simple so don't be intimidated by that! Most are just different spices.

Time-saving tip: Use your favorite store-bought tomato sauce instead of making your own.

If you try it out, I'd love to hear what you think of it! Let me know if the tempeh ""sausage"" passes the test. Follow me on Instagram and tag me in your creations so I can see what you're up to! I'll also be sharing my Hawaiian adventure over there for the next two weeks, if you're interested in seeing what we're getting up to!

Serves 3-4

Ingredients

1 1/2 cups dry rotini or penne noodles (Note: I always find it confusing when pasta is listed in grams so I find this method much easier! This will cook up to approximately three cups cooked pasta so if you'd like bigger servings, increase accordingly!)

Spicy Tempeh ""Sausage""

1 x 200 g package of tempeh

2 tbsp olive oil, divided

1 tbsp Italian spice blend

1 tsp fennel, ground

½ tsp onion powder

½ tsp garlic powder

½ tsp. chili peppers (flakes), dried (adjust or omit if you don't like spice)

⅛ tsp pepper

¼ cup soy sauce

Sauce (or replace for your favorite store-bought sauce)

2 tbsp olive oil

10 plum tomatoes, cut into eight pieces each (quartered and then halved again)

3 cloves garlic, minced

½ of a medium red onion, roughly chopped

2 cups water

Coarse salt and freshly-cracked pepper to taste (approx ⅛ tsp each and increase to taste)

¼ cup fresh basil

Directions:

Cook pasta according to package directions. Combine all tempeh sausage ingredients (except tempeh) into a small bowl. Whisk together with a fork and set aside. Cut your block of tempeh into four strips, lengthwise. Next, on a diagonal, cut each strip into bite-sized pieces (like you would slicing up a sausage into oblong coin-like pieces). Start cooking your pasta, according to package directions. Drain and set aside. If it starts to clump together before you mix with the sauce, run hot water over it to separate the noodles right before mixing with your sauce. Next, over medium-high heat, add your tempeh and sauce to a large frying pan. Cover with two cups of water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and allow all liquid to boil off, approximately 10-15 minutes. (If you're using a store-bought tomato sauce, skip steps six and seven) Meanwhile, heat two tablespoons olive oil in a medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Once heated, add your onion and saute for about two minutes. Add your garlic and cook an additional two-three minutes, until both garlic and onion are translucent and fragrant. Next add tomatoes to the olive oil and reduce to a simmer to cook down, approx 10-15 minutes. You want this to cook down into a chunky sauce. When your sauce is the desired consistency, add the tempeh sausage to the sauce. Finish with the fresh basil and adjust the flavour with any extra salt, pepper or chili flakes if needed. Finish by tossing the noodles in the sauce, stir to combine well and serve!

Happy eating!

I think we need to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top pic.twitter.com/PgXmCkY3Yc October 28, 2017

It was writer and publisher Thomas Baekdal who first drew our attention to the mess that is the Google hamburger. Not only did they include a tomato under the lettuce (everyone knows they are just a soggy-bun inducing disaster) but they also made the executive decision to put the cheese slice under the hamburger. Ensuring a soggy bottom as well as top. And to think this horror show went through several rounds of approval. In response Pichai has promised that Google will resolve their mistakes this week, but only if the internet can agree on the correct way to do this - which doesn’t hold much hope for actually getting this sorted anytime soon.

Trump took office last January, millions of people joined women’s marches around the world, setting attendance records and elevating expectations about what organized resistance to the ideals that gave rise to the 45th president could look like.

Nine months later, the crowd gathered in Detroit for the inaugural Women’s Convention — which was put together by the same organizers — was a fraction of the size, but for the reported 4,000 attendees, that same energy was still there.

“I was like, this is something I have to be a part of. This is somewhere I need to be,” Jennifer Onwenu, a 25-year-old from Detroit, Mich., told HuffPost. “The women that I have met, the lessons I have learned to take back to my community as far as organizing and mobilizing people, have been so useful.”

“It’s a national women’s conference in Detroit. Why wouldn’t I be here?” echoed Deborah Bunklay, 63, also from Detroit. Bunklay received a scholarship to the convention, covering the nearly $300 cost of a three-day ticket.

She and her friend, Cheryl Bukoff, 72, said they were particularly struck by the diversity of the gathering. A heterogenous crowd of women — and a few men — networked under soaring banners that declared they were “reclaiming our time.”

Catherine Pearson/HuffPost The convention included an ""art gallery"" with pieces curated by the design lab Amplifier.

“One of the the things I think is most important is that there are many younger women here, and that for many of us have been active for a long time, we know we need to have the young women taking leadership,” Bukoff said. “I’d be glad to support any of them.”

Over three days, attendees listened to panels like, “94 percent voted against Trump: following black women in 2018” and “How to organize a protest/rally in less than 24 hours!” EMILY’s List, the group that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights, hosted a free half-day training for those interested in running for local elections. Indeed, much of the convention focused on the goal of Democrats gaining ground in the 2018 midterm elections.

There were also addresses from public figures such as Rose McGowan, who spoke publicly for the first time since accusing Harvey Weinstein of rape, and fiery speeches from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), both of whom have been floated as potential presidential candidates. Both Congresswomen were met with standing ovations and raucous cheers.

On Saturday, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) led an enthusiastic crowd in chants of “Impeach 45!” and told cheering attendees how thrilled she had been to march with them last winter.

But several women HuffPost spoke to said they had not marched. They felt driven to go to the Women’s Convention because they wanted to join what organizers have taken pains to paint as an ongoing movement, rather than a one-time event.

“I feel like I really missed a lot,” said Zitlatlli Roman, 27, from Ill. whose employer paid for her to go to the convention. “It’s just very inspirational to be able to be a part of it from now on.”

Another attendee, who wore a Wonder Woman T-shirt and a pink “pussy hat” covered in feminist pins, told HuffPost she’d knit it especially for the occasion. It was lighter than the wool version she’d worn while marching in January.

Whether or not the convention is considered a success is largely a matter of spin and perspective. News outlets have called it a “test” of the movement that grew out of last winter’s marches, and it is not certain whether organizers met the ticket sales goals they’d initially set forth.

El trabajo tiene que salir

Ricardo Arduengo, fotógrafo en Puerto Rico

De pequeño viví el huracán Hugo, que golpeó esta isla en 1989. Luego, como periodista, me ha tocado cubrir otras tormentas, como el huracán Irene en República Dominicana en 2011. Pero yo nunca había visto una como esta.

La destrucción esta vez pegó en casa, literalmente. Mi familia estaba en Barranquita, en el centro de la isla y, como no había comunicaciones y estaba cerrado el paso, demoré tres días en ir para saber si estaban bien. Al igual que en los demás lugares, había árboles caídos alrededor, pero, por suerte, solamente se rompió una ventana.

Recibí el huracán en Fajardo, en el este de la isla, en el mismo lugar donde cubrí la llegada del huracán Irma dos semanas antes. Por ahí no iba a pasar el ojo de María, pero sí estaba bastante cerca.

Pasé la noche en un catre y a las 5 de la mañana ya el viento estaba soplando bastante fuerte. Como a las 10 de la mañana el río Fajardo se había desbordado y estaba cerca de la alcaldía, aunque no llegó a entrar.

Hubo un momento de tranquilidad en medio de la tormenta en que pude salir e hice un par de fotos de un señor rescatando de un garaje que tenía al lado de su casa unos gallos de pelea. Estaba cargando uno de los animales con el agua hasta la cintura.

Después de la tormenta recorrí toda la isla. Casi todas las fotos que hice con dron también las había hecho desde abajo, como la del hombre que está caminando en la inundación. Esa escena solo podía ilustrarla bien si la tomaba desde arriba.

Aún a pesar de que esta es una situación que me toca en lo personal, me concentré en mostrar la historia. Hay momentos en que a uno se le hace un nudo en la garganta frente a todo este dolor, pero uno tiene que seguir. Traté de concentrarme en hacer mi trabajo. ""Estoy retratando. Si dejo que me afecte, va a afectar el trabajo"", pensé.

Mi responsabilidad aquí no es solamente como puertorriqueño. No hago esto solo porque quiero que el mundo vea lo que está pasando aquí. Trabajo igual si estoy cubriendo otro tipo de noticias. Estoy pensando en que el trabajo tiene que salir, en que hay que mostrar lo que está pasando.

La responsabilidad de ser testigo

Eléonore Sens, videorreportera en Washington

Por primera vez en mi joven carrera de periodista sentí el peso de la responsabilidad de nuestro oficio. Mientras tenía lugar una disputa mediática entre la alcaldesa de la capital puertorriqueña, Carmen Yulín Cruz, y el presidente Donald Trump sobre la entrega -o no- de la ayuda a Puerto Rico, presencié una catástrofe natural y humanitaria. Cada imagen filmada y testimonio era prueba de la urgencia de la situación a la que estábamos asistiendo.

Apenas salimos de San Juan, las condiciones de vida de los pobladores eran cada vez más rudimentarias. No tenían agua corriente, electricidad, cobertura telefónica y, muy a menudo, ni siquiera una casa digna de este nombre.

La gente que nos cruzábamos tomaba agua del río a falta de provisiones. Algunos lo perdieron todo: su hogar, su sustento. Los puertorriqueños ni siquiera podían contarles a sus familiares si estaban bien o no.

Luego, a medida que nos alejamos de la ciudad, los habitantes de los pueblos que nos cruzábamos no habían visto ninguna ayuda. Más de diez días después de la catástrofe, los testimonios eran todos iguales: nadie del ejército, ni de FEMA (fondo federal de EU de ayuda para desastres), ni ninguna autoridad gubernamental habían venido para ayudar a estas personas totalmente aisladas del mundo.

Sin embargo, frente a una situación insoportable, la resistencia de los puertorriqueños me impresionó. En lugar de llorar por la falta de ayuda, la mayoría de la gente parecía organizarse por su cuenta y ayudarse mutuamente. Conocimos, por ejemplo, a profesionales de la salud que iban a los refugios para proveer tratamientos y medicinas.

A veces uno se olvidaba de la gravedad y la angustia de esta situación. Estos paisajes tan caóticos se me hicieron familiares. La gente nos sonreía y nos agradecía por venir a reportear. Pero luego había algunos recordatorios.

Una noche vimos una niña que prácticamente vivía entre planchas de chapa húmeda: su casa había volado con María. El grado de insalubridad en el que vivía me impactó. Su madre no había recibido ninguna ayuda de las autoridades y, aún así, mientras escribo esto, el presidente estadounidense habla de quitar la ayuda a este territorio.

Cubrir un huracán con otro desastre en casa

José Osorio, videorreportero en México

El 18 de septiembre estaba listo para cubrir al día siguiente el aniversario del sismo que mató a miles de personas en México en 1985 cuando sonó el teléfono y mi editora en Montevideo me pidió que viajara a Puerto Rico a cubrir el huracán. Llegué a San Juan al otro día, justo antes del cierre del aeropuerto, a tiempo para ir a Fajardo a recibir la tormenta.

Paré en una gasolinera en la ruta para grabar a la gente haciendo fila para llenar el tanque de gasolina. Eran pasadas las dos de la tarde y era también el inicio de otra desgracia, en tierra propia y sin vientos huracanados, otra cara de la furia de nuestro planeta-isla.

Me llamó mi novia para decirme que en México acababa de temblar. La escuché muy nerviosa y traté de calmarla, pensando que era otro de esos temblores que solo causan un susto menor. Pero no, este era otra cosa, otro calibre.

Me vi en una situación difícil. Tenía que llegar a Fajardo porque en unas horas más entraría el huracán María, pero sentía ya ganas de regresar y estar con los míos en México. Tardé poco más de un día en saber que toda mi gente estaba bien, y también me fui enterando de que el edificio donde vivimos se había dañado, que el edificio de mi padre se había resquebrajado y que él no podía seguir viviendo ahí.

Mientras me preparaba para el huracán, mentalmente me estaba preparando para regresar en algún momento a mi ciudad, que ya no iba a ser la misma. Pero la posibilidad de volver al DF se desvanecía. El día después del paso de María tuve que salir de la alcaldía de Fajardo, el lugar donde nos resguardamos, para poder transmitir desde un hotel, que había sufrido daños severos pero pudo mantenerse operando.

El trayecto me mostró la gravedad de los daños. Cientos de árboles caídos, postes en el piso, cables colgando, zonas inundadas, nadie en la calle. Tuve que hacerme a la idea de que estaría ahí un buen rato y me dediqué, junto con mis compañeros, a cubrir de la mejor manera posible esa otra desgracia. Pasó otra semana antes de que pudiera dejar Puerto Rico.

La única forma que hay

Héctor Retamal, fotógrafo en Haití

Vivo en Haití desde hace 4 años. Y hace un año cubrí el huracán Matthew. Las situaciones que vemos, el dolor de las personas por el azote de los desastres naturales, claramente nos afecta. Pero debemos procesar estos sentimientos. Trato de canalizar toda esa energía para mostrar lo que ocurre en mis fotos.

En los días siguientes al paso del Huracán María traté de mostrar cómo fue afectada la población: casas destruidas y personas buscando agua o cocinando en la noche fuera de las ruinas de sus casas como María, una mujer de Toa Alta que cocinaba afuera de su casa, alumbrándose con una linterna.

A medida que pasaban los días intenté buscar historias que mostraran cómo las personas afectadas luchaban y salían adelante, a pesar de haberlo perdido todo. Me gusta especialmente la imagen del joven con una bandera que dice ""voy a ti Puerto Rico"", que significa ""hincho por ti"", porque para mí simboliza fuerza y esperanza después de la destrucción.

No tienen sentido ir allí a tomar fotos y ni siquiera saber qué les pasó.

Unos días antes de volver a Haití visité a las personas que había fotografiado en los días posteriores al huracán.

Debemos estar cerca, no tan solo para tener buenas imágenes, sino por respeto hacia los afectados . No tienen sentido ir allí a tomar fotos y ni siquiera saber qué les pasó o no mostrar interés en sus relatos y sus vidas. Por eso siempre intento volver a verlos antes de marcharme. Quiero que sientan que a alguien le importa su dolor.

Trabajando en la oscuridad

Leila Macor, corresponsal en Miami

María dejó en Puerto Rico una crisis humanitaria e hizo retroceder a sus habitantes décadas atrás en términos de telecomunicaciones. No había electricidad, agua corriente, teléfono ni internet. En este contexto cubrir la noticia fue particularmente desafiante.

Teníamos un teléfono satelital para emergencias y dos terminales de internet satelital BGAN, con los que podíamos transmitir, aunque no revisar continuamente la prensa en la web. Un recurso tan elemental del oficio como confirmar una noticia era una odisea. Normalmente todo lo que hay que hacer es un par de llamadas telefónicas.

Ahora, la única forma de saber si un rumor era cierto era yendo al pueblo en cuestión y preguntarle a los residentes si habían visto pasar al alcalde por allí, para consultarle a él sobre el asunto.

Trabajábamos a oscuras la mayor parte del tiempo, sin ver la ""big picture"" hasta que llegaba la noche y nos conectábamos en el Centro de Convenciones en San Juan, donde todavía hoy opera el gobierno y había una sala de prensa.

Allí nos enterábamos de que Trump había dicho durante el día que los periodistas estábamos exagerando. Con una triste impotencia, tocaba transmitir lo que habíamos visto y que él no nos creía.

Los puertorriqueños no tenían adónde ir ni cómo irse. No funcionaban los hospitales. Los enfermos estaban sufriendo. No había nada abierto. No se podía llamar a nadie. Tras el paso de María, cada residente estaba -y está, muchos siguen estando- solo, en su casa o lo que quedó de ella, sano o herido, en un pequeño universo personal en el que los días transcurrían lentamente, buscando qué comer, qué beber y dónde bañarse.

La ayuda comenzó a llegar a cuentagotas después de que el tema se volvió polémico. Pasada una semana, aún los pobladores de los pueblos del interior nos recibían con la esperanza de que fuéramos la FEMA o la Cruz Roja. Pero no. ""Somos periodistas"", les decíamos. ""Lo único que podemos hacer es contar tu historia"".

Por eso, los textos que salieron desde el terreno tuvieron la misma atmósfera que las fotografías y los videos de mis colegas: eran retratos de los damnificados que nos cruzábamos; imágenes en palabras, escenas, microhistorias.

From 'Game of Thrones' and 'The Babadook' to 'Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries' Davis has amassed a devoted following in each role she inhabits.

""I like to play roles that are very different from each other,"" Davis told HuffPost Australia.

""But you don't always get to choose your roles, quite often they choose you.""

Recently Davis starred alongside Bryan Cranston in an episode of 'Phillip K. Dick's Electric Dreams', an anthology series of 10 standalone episodes based on Dick's work.

Davis and Cranston's episode 'Human Is' is based on the short story of the same name set in a distant future. Davis plays Vera, a woman whose cold husband -- Silas, played by Cranston -- chips away at her emotionally. Their loveless marriage is as desolate as the dying Earth.

When Silas travels to the nearby planet Rexor IV he comes back changed, for the better, but it begins to dawn on Vera that perhaps this is no longer her husband. If he really has been taken over by something otherworldly, does that make him any less human?

Bryan Cranston and Essie Davis in 'Human Is'.

""[Vera] is a powerful woman who is incredibly vulnerable in her relationship, and living with that kind of oppression while still having a very high powered role... versus what's happening at home,"" Davis said.

""I've been fortunate to have the opportunities to have played to many strong women, and I've also played many vulnerable women. Finding that strength and the reason behind, sometimes being soft is strong, sometimes being flexible is the strongest position to take. Even in good, caring relationships equality is not necessarily equality.""

At the heart of the episode is the question what makes us human? What defines humanity?

When we asked Davis what she thought the answer to those questions would be she thought for a moment before saying, ""having great intelligence is one thing, but having the capacity to care for each other is another"".

""Love, kindness and democracy make us human. Caring for another person, that's really the essence of what defines humanity.""

Davis is no stranger to love; as we mentioned some of her roles have garnered cult-like followings.

Recently the producers behind the 'Miss Fisher' series set up a crowdfunding page. The aim was to fill a funding gap in the production budget as well as to assure investors there was a keen fan base hungry for a 'Miss Fisher' movie.

In less than two days they had reached their initial goal of $250,000. By the end of the Kickstarter campaign they had raised over $700,000. The investors could rest assured, fans wanted to see Miss Fisher on the big screen.

""I think there are many elements to why fans love 'Miss Fisher', but I'm sure it's Phryne's independence with joy. There's something so attractive about being around a happy person,"" she laughed, immediately proving her own point.

Davis starring as Phryne Fisher in 'Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries'.

""She can break the rules in the most satisfyingly naughty way, but for the good of all. She stands up for the underdog, male or female, she's a feminist but she's a lover. She loves men but she won't be treated badly by them, the ones who try... she gets one over.""

Back to the idea of love and kindness defining us as human, Davis notes Phryne Fisher embodies that and more.

""That burst between Jack and Phryne, there's nothing more attractive that you want to lean into than watching people fall in love with each other.""

Miss Fisher isn't the only role Davis is tied to, she mentioned the other project she's constantly recognised for is playing Amelia in Jennifer Kent's 2014 film 'The Babadook'. The film made little waves in Australia but began to snowball when it traveled overseas, becoming a cult favourite of audiences.

Then there was the resurgence of the film this year, with the internet christening the character of the Babadook as a queer icon.

""We've all been very, very amused,"" Davis laughed at the mention of the Babadook's newfound status. ""I'm very happy we've acquired an even wider audience.

""It's a great film and yes, the Babadook does want to get out of that closet. I love it, I think it's great.""

Dix-huit ans plus tard, c'est Jacques Chirac qui a appris à ses dépens qu'instaurer la sélection à l'université ne va pas de soi.
Elle l'a pourtant fait en 2016 quand Najat Vallaud-Belkacem et Thierry Mandon ont acté le principe d'une sélection entre la licence et le master.
Elle a toujours préféré -y compris dans le communiqué de presse qui actait le succès des négociations- le mot de ""recrutement"".","ENSEIGNEMENT SUPÉRIEUR - Il n'y aura pas de sélection comme certains étudiants en connaissent déjà. Les bacheliers de la promotion 2018 n'auront pas de concours pour entrer à l'université comme c'est le cas dans les grandes écoles, ou d'examen sur dossier avec entretien de motivation comme des classes prépa en mettent en place pour choisir leurs élèves.

Le plan que le gouvernement présentait ce lundi 29 octobre pour réformer l'entrée dans les études supérieures se garde bien de mettre en place une ""sélection"". Un mot qui reste tabou. ""Je n'ai jamais eu peur du mot sélection"", a d'ailleurs tenté d'expliquer le Premier ministre lors de la présentation du plan étudiant, mais ""entre la sélection brutale et le tirage au sort, il existe une palette de solutions beaucoup plus souples, plus humaines et plus intelligentes"".

Même le terme ""pré-requis"" qui a longtemps animé la discussion, était absent du discours d'Édouard Philippe et de la ministre de l'Enseignement supérieur Frédérique Vidal, lui préférant le mot ""attendus"".

À l'issue d'une longue série de concertations, ils ont annoncé le remplacement du tirage au sort dans les filières en tension par un examen du dossier par l'université. Mais c'est bien l'étudiant qui aura le dernier mot et pourra, s'il le décide intégrer la filière de son choix. Avec une forte injonction à suivre des enseignements de remise à niveau.""La question de la sélection, des prérequis a été abandonnée pour un accompagnement personnalisé, par profil d'élève"", se réjouit Liliana Moyano, présidente de la fédération de parents d'élèves FCPE: ""Cela permet de garder le bac comme porte d'entrée aux études supérieures, et que les lycéens restent acteurs de leur projet"".

Pas de prise de risque pour Macron

Ce n'est pas du tout l'avis du député Les Républicains Pierre-Henri Dumont. Pour ce fervent partisan d'une véritable sélection ""qui favoriserait le mérite"", Emmanuel Macron est tombé dans un piège. ""Il a renoncé de peur de faire converger les luttes sociales contre lui. Alors que la contestation sur la loi Travail n'est pas totalement terminée, il ne voulait pas risquer de se retrouver avec les syndicats et les étudiants en même temps dans la rue avec le risque que les manifestations dégénèrent"", estime le député du Pas-de-Calais.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon ne s'y trompe pas. C'est à la jeunesse qu'il en appelle pour faire repartir le mouvement contre la loi Travail dans une vidéo tournée samedi depuis la Grèce.

Mais Emmanuel Macron n'était visiblement pas disposé à prendre le risque. Avec sa ministre, et même si leur expérience politique est courte, il savent qu'agiter le mot ""sélection"" -ce qui revient à donner le dernier mot aux établissement- est la garantie de mettre les universités à l'arrêt et les étudiants dans la rue.

De mai 68 à la loi Devaquet

Et cela a commencé dès mai 68, comme le rappelle l'historien Claude Lelièvre sur le site Café padagogique. Il rappelle que le général de Gaulle avait donné à Alain Peyrefitte la mission de ""faire passer la sélection et l'orientation"".

Le texte présenté en conseil des ministres en avril 1968 n'était pas si éloigné du projet porté aujourd'hui par Frédérique Vidal. ""L'inscription automatique interviendra, dans la voie choisie, pour la moitié environ ou les deux tiers des bacheliers: ceux qui ont obtenu une mention plus ceux qui ont obtenu 12 sur 20 dans les disciplines fondamentales de la voie choisie. Pour les autres, le droit à l'inscription ne sera pas automatique. Le bachelier pourra se porter simultanément candidat à plusieurs établissements. Les candidatures seront examinées, sur présentation du dossier scolaire, par des jurys d'établissement, lesquels pourront accepter ou refuser l'admission"", précisait le projet de loi. Cela se rapproche des fameux pré-requis aujourd'hui évoqué par le gouvernement.

Seulement, alors que le texte devait être examiné à l'Assemblée les 14,15 et 16 mai 1968, il ne sera jamais débattu. ""Ce projet n'a pas été pour rien dans la mobilisation étudiante et lycéenne"", estime Claude Lelièvre qui rappelle que le général de Gaulle a finalement zappé cette partie dans la loi de refondation de l'université présentée fin 68 pour tirer les leçons des événements du printemps.

Dix-huit ans plus tard, c'est Jacques Chirac qui a appris à ses dépens qu'instaurer la sélection à l'université ne va pas de soi. À l'automne 1986, la réforme portée par Alain Devaquet provoque même les plus grandes manifestations étudiantes depuis mai 68. Ce texte qui créait de la concurrence entre les universités et instaurait l'entrée en licence est d'abord retravaillé mais de nouvelles manifestations qui conduisent au décès de Malik Oussekine sous les coups des CRS poussent le premier ministre à abandonner sa réforme.

Pas de sélection mais un ""recrutement"" pour la gauche au pouvoir

La droite qui est aujourd'hui favorable à l'instauration de cette sélection -Pierre-Henri Dumont dénonce ""une illusion d'égalité""- ne l'avait pas appliquée quand elle est revenue au pouvoir de 2002 à 2012 sachant ce sujet explosif.

La gauche qui y est historiquement opposée a longtemps refusé de lancer le débat. Elle l'a pourtant fait en 2016 quand Najat Vallaud-Belkacem et Thierry Mandon ont acté le principe d'une sélection entre la licence et le master. Mais la ministre de l'Education nationale n'a jamais repris le terme de ""sélection"" utilisé par son secrétaire d'Etat à l'Enseignement supérieur. Elle a toujours préféré -y compris dans le communiqué de presse qui actait le succès des négociations- le mot de ""recrutement"".

""C'est le bac qui est historiquement la porte d'entrée à l'enseignement supérieur. La sélection ne peut pas être un projet de société. Que fait-on de ceux qui ne sont pas sélectionnés?"", se demande Liliana Moyano. Avec plusieurs responsables de syndicats, elle a cosigné une tribune publiée dans Le Monde dans laquelle elle estime que ""cette sélection n'apporterait qu'un accroissement de la ségrégation sociale"".

En choisissant de ne pas s'engager vers une véritable sélection (même si ses opposants les plus radicaux le considéreront), Emmanuel Macron qui a toujours pris soin de ne pas employer le terme a tenu à ne pas donner un nouveau signal que sa politique est davantage marquée à droite qu'à gauche.

Auch das Thema innere Sicherheit wird dabei eine Rolle spielen - und für Streit sorgen

Uneinigkeit herrscht vor allem beim Thema Videoüberwachung und der Rolle der Geheimdienste

Gewalt auf der Straße, Wohnungseinbrüche, Angst vor Terror: Die innere Sicherheit treibt viele Bürger um. Bei den heutigen Sondierungsgesprächen von Union, FDP und Grünen wird es unter anderem darum gehen, gemeinsame Antworten auf diese Fragen zu finden.

Es dürfte eine schwierige Debatte werden, denn in ihren Wahlprogrammen vertreten die möglichen Koalitionspartner unterschiedliche Standpunkte zu den Themen.

Die Union spricht sich beispielsweise für mehr Überwachung aus und fordert mehr Befugnisse für Polizei, Geheimdienste und dergleichen. Grüne und FDP dagegen sind gegen eine großflächige Kameraüberwachung.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 5 große Konflikte, an denen ein Jamaika-Bündnis scheitern könnte - und warum sie wahrscheinlich gelöst werden

Die einzelnen Diskussionspunkte im Überblick:

► Polizei: Die Union verspricht 15.000 zusätzliche Polizisten in Bund und Ländern. Auch die Grünen fordern mehr Beamte. Die FDP verlangt ebenfalls deutlich mehr Geld für die Polizei. Um Polizisten zu entlasten, will die FDP auch prüfen, ob bestimmte Aufgaben nicht auch andere Behörden übernehmen können - etwa beim Objektschutz oder der Begleitung von Schwertransporten.

Die Union plädiert außerdem für ein “Musterpolizeigesetz” für alle Bundesländer, um bundeseinheitliche Standards zu erreichen.

► Justiz: Damit Straftaten am Ende auch vor Gericht landen, plädieren die Grünen dafür, auch bei Gerichten und Staatsanwaltschaften das Personal aufzustocken - allerdings ohne Zahlen zu nennen. Auch die FDP fordert eine “Haushaltspriorität” für die Justiz und mahnt, für die klassischen Hoheitsaufgaben des Staates müsse mehr Geld zur Verfügung stehen.

Grüne wollen Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz auflösen

► Geheimdienste: Die Union bekennt sich zu den deutschen Nachrichtendiensten. Die Grünen dagegen wollen das Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz in seiner jetzigen Form auflösen und grundlegend anders aufbauen.

Die FDP ist ebenfalls für Reformen beim Verfassungsschutz und will die Zahl der Sicherheitsbehörden insgesamt minimieren, um die Strukturen übersichtlicher zu machen.

► Videoüberwachung: Die Union will im öffentlichen Raum, zum Beispiel in Einkaufszentren, vor Fußballstadien und an Verkehrsknotenpunkten mehr Videokameras installieren, auch zur Fahndung. Grüne und FDP betonen, Videoüberwachung dürfe es nur in Maßen geben, aber auf keinen Fall flächendeckend.

► Datenzugriff für Sicherheitsbehörden: Die Union will den Sicherheitsbehörden mehr Zugriff auf vorhandene Datenbanken geben - zur Verhinderung und Aufklärung schwerer Straftaten. Die FDP wendet sich gegen jede anlasslose Datensammlung - wie etwa die Vorratsdatenspeicherung. Auch die Möglichkeiten zur Funkzellenabfrage will die FDP einschränken.

► Terrorabwehr: Die Union will das Gemeinsame Terrorismusabwehrzentrum von Bund und Ländern so weiterentwickeln, “dass dort gemeinsam über verbindliche Maßnahmen entschieden werden kann”. Bislang ist das Zentrum eher eine Plattform zum Informationsaustausch.

Die FDP tritt dafür ein, zur besseren Terrorbekämpfung Europol zu einer EU-Bundespolizei auszubauen und auch einen EU-Nachrichtendienst zu gründen.

But more remarkable is that this record population growth has exceeded all forecasts. In 1998, the Australian Bureau of Statistics predicted that, based on low-growth assumptions, Australia's population would reach 23.5 million people in 2051, a benchmark it went on to achieve in July 2014.

​​​​

The mid-growth forecast of 24.9 million people by 2051 will be reached in the middle of next year, 33 years early! The upper-end forecast of 26.4 million, based on high-growth assumptions, will be reached in mid-2021, less than four years away.

The current growth patterns of Australia will lead us to a population of 38 million by 2051, around 12 million higher than even the high-ball forecasts of the late '90s. It's not that the calculations were wrong, it's that migration policy changes as well as longevity increases and a solid birth rate have defied the trends that were evident 20 years ago.

Back then, it was assumed that the total fertility rate (babies per woman in a lifetime) would remain low. However, today's TFR of 1.81 is above even the highest assumption allowed for in the '90s of 1.75.

It was also thought that life expectancy at birth would hit a high of 82 for males and 86 for females by 2051. However, current life expectancy is already closing in on 81 for males and 85 for females and will reach these 2051 targets decades early.

The biggest growth factor that has blown out previous population modelling has been the rise and rise of Australia's net overseas migration. In 1998 it was thought that it would grow our population annually by around 70,000, or at the most, 90,000. In the past 12 months, Australia has added 231,900 through net migration which is more than 2.5 times even the high-forecast of two decades ago.

The expectations for our largest cities back in this era were also well below what has eventuated. This 1998 report expected Melbourne to reach a population of between 3.6 million and 4.5 million by 2051. It is currently well above this range at 4.8 million. Sydney was predicted to reach between 4.7 million and 6.2 million by the middle of this century. It is currently around 5.1 million and will reach the higher forecast within a decade, 23 years early.

While the late '90s may not seem like that long ago -- John Howard was Prime Minister, and Bill Clinton was the U.S. President -- the past two decades have seen significant shifts in our demographic trends.

Back then, slowing population growth was responded to with policy changes like the baby bonus and efforts to increase overseas migration. Australia's population growth is now one of the highest in the developed world.

We have added 390,000 people to our population in the past 12 months, which is like adding three cities the size of Darwin to our population each year. Sydney is now home to more people than the whole country of New Zealand. Speaking of which, New Zealand, back in 1998 was expected to reach 4.7 million in 2050 -- its population currently exceeds 4.8 million. Melbourne is growing even faster and rather than having 1.7 million fewer people than Sydney in 2051 as was predicted, it will likely overtake Sydney to be Australia's largest city this year.

The lesson for policy makers, urban planners and governments alike, is to keep a close eye on the population forecasts and plan early for the growth that is being experienced so that our cities are not left short of infrastructure.

While population growth can't realistically be stopped, it must be better planned for and managed to ensure the Australian lifestyle continues. And when in doubt, assume the higher growth forecasts not the lower ones. I'm yet to see an Australian population forecast that needs adjusting down.",Why Australia's Population Has Boomed Beyond All Growth Forecasts,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/mark-mccrindle/why-australias-population-has-boomed-beyond-all-growth-forecasts_a_23260070/

Il appartiendrait ainsi à une minorité agissante de définir l'issue du débat avant même qu'il n'ait commencé, la rédaction de la constitution d'un pays indépendant.
Autre symptôme d'une dérive sectaire, l'entente prévoit que Québec solidaire sera tenu de dénoncer à tous les tournants le « Quebec bashing ».
La direction de QS n'a pas permis à ses associations locales d'intervenir dans la genèse de cet accord de fusion.
Une union à la hussarde qui va à l'encontre de tout ce que Québec solidaire prétend représenter jusqu'à présent.","Les directions d'Option nationale et de Québec solidaire invitent leurs membres début décembre à ratifier une entente fusionnant les deux formations. Aucun indépendantiste ne peut être contre l'addition de ces deux forces, mais les termes du projet de fusion rendent peu probable la stabilité d'un tel mariage. L'entente de principe négociée préserve en effet le maintien d'Option nationale comme organisation au sein de Québec solidaire. Elle lui octroie en outre un droit de préemption sur tout ce qui touche à la question nationale et prévoit le remplacement du programme indépendantiste de QS par celui d'ON.

Très pointilleux sur la question de l'égalité des sexes, QS n'a pas de « chef », mais une porte-parole féminine et un porte-parole masculin. Sans égard aux statuts et sans élection, le projet d'entente ajoute un troisième porte-parole en la personne de Sol Zanetti : « 18. Le parti unifié mettra de l'avant le chef actuel d'ON dans les communications publiques et les activités du parti unifié sur les enjeux entourant l'indépendance du Québec ». Zanetti se voit également garantir sa candidature dans un comté « gagnable » en 2018, une hérésie pour une formation qui critique régulièrement les partis traditionnels pour leur recours au parachutage de candidats.

Option nationale deviendrait un véritable parti dans le parti.

Option nationale deviendrait un véritable parti dans le parti. Il existe bien à QS des « collectifs » (écosocialisme, laïcité, jeunesse, etc.), mais ces collectifs n'ont ni budget ni pouvoirs particuliers. En pratique, ce sont de simples cercles de discussion. Il est par contre prévu qu'Option nationale deviendra un collectif avec budget autonome. Dans les faits, il sera le dépositaire de l'orthodoxie souverainiste au sein de QS. Ce collectif ON contrôlera la conception et la production de matériel sur l'indépendance, organisera une université annuelle sur le sujet et fera réimprimer aux frais de QS son ouvrage leLivre qui fait dire oui. Le thème de l'indépendance serait omniprésent, sur les communiqués, sur le logo, sur les affiches.

Option nationale obtient l'abandon du programme de Québec solidaire sur l'indépendance et son remplacement par le sien. QS a toujours refusé de hiérarchiser ses valeurs fondamentales, écologie, féminisme, justice et solidarité sociale, indépendance, démocratie, respect des droits des minorités et des autochtones, etc. Pour les solidaires, la souveraineté n'a aucun sens sans projet de société. Ce que disaient d'ailleurs les souverainistes de la première heure dans le programme du Parti québécois de 1969. L'entente, elle, hiérarchise. Elle édicte que la lutte contre le « régime colonial canadien » devra avoir une importance au moins égale à celle contre le néolibéralisme, sans aucune mention des autres principes. Le Québec, colonie du Canada ? Derrière cet absurde raccourci historique se profile l'illusion que le Québec peut proclamer unilatéralement son indépendance en invoquant un statut de colonie, une position intenable en droit international.

Le débat durerait de longs mois et ce serait aux indépendantistes de convaincre la majorité que leur option est la meilleure.

Depuis sa création, QS veut sortir le Québec de l'impasse qui dure depuis 1995 et rompre avec la stratégie référendaire classique où un gouvernement souverainiste rédige une question alambiquée et demande à l'électorat de répondre par oui ou par non. QS se réclame plutôt de la démocratie participative où c'est le peuple qui exerce sa souveraineté et décide de son avenir, par le biais d'une Assemblée constituante élue au suffrage universel qui rédigera un projet de constitution, à ratifier lors d'un référendum. Cette approche a l'avantage de permettre la participation de ceux qui ne favorisent pas l'indépendance (68 % des Québécois selon le sondage CROP du mois d'août) et de briser 35 ans de dialogue de sourds où le camp fédéraliste se contente de dire non sans préciser ses propres solutions quant à l'avenir de la nation. Le débat durerait de longs mois et ce serait aux indépendantistes de convaincre la majorité que leur option est la meilleure.

Cette vision démocratique disparaît dans l'entente proposée. Il est dit que l'Assemblée constituante « aura pour mandat d'élaborer un projet de constitution d'un Québec indépendant ». C'est là le programme d'Option nationale. Il appartiendrait ainsi à une minorité agissante de définir l'issue du débat avant même qu'il n'ait commencé, la rédaction de la constitution d'un pays indépendant. Autre symptôme d'une dérive sectaire, l'entente prévoit que Québec solidaire sera tenu de dénoncer à tous les tournants le « Quebec bashing ». Comme si les relations avec le Canada se résumaient à un combat simpliste entre bons et méchants.

Tout ceci culmine dans la théorie oniste de la gouvernance souverainiste. Les négociateurs solidaires l'ont reprise à leur compte : « Un gouvernement de Québec solidaire appliquera les mesures prévues à son programme, qu'elles soient compatibles ou non avec le cadre constitutionnel canadien ». Ceci contredit carrément le programme de QS qui a toujours fait la distinction entre ce qui est réalisable avant l'indépendance et ce qui le sera après. ON a au contraire la prétention de pouvoir gouverner comme si Ottawa n'existait pas. Sur la base de quel mandat ? Aucun, sauf la conviction de posséder la vérité. Car, ne l'oublions pas, aucun gouvernement québécois n'a gouverné avec plus de 50 % des suffrages depuis Robert Bourassa en 1989. Le dernier gouvernement Charest et celui de Philippe Couillard aujourd'hui étaient majoritaires, mais ils n'ont obtenu tous deux que 42 % des voix. Une telle confusion entre mandat de gouvernement et mandat de sécession est foncièrement antidémocratique. Sans compter qu'elle ne résisterait pas à l'examen des tribunaux.

La direction de QS n'a pas permis à ses associations locales d'intervenir dans la genèse de cet accord de fusion. De plus, elle a décrété que le texte ne sera pas amendable lors du congrès de décembre, écartant ainsi toute possibilité de compromis que pourrait suggérer sa base. Les membres de QS sont maintenant confrontés à un choix non démocratique, une sorte de bill omnibus à la Stephen Harper. S'ils veulent accueillir ON en leur sein, ils devront adopter en bloc tout ce que contient l'entente.

Ignazio Visco ci arriva ""corazzato"" dalle ultime ""precisazioni"" di Via Nazionale: nessuno degli ex dipendenti della banca assunti dalla popolare di Vicenza è stato ispettore nella banca veneta. Nessun caso di porte girevoli: stop alle illazioni.

Questo il senso della nota diffusa in serata da palazzo Koch, dopo che negli ultimi 5 giorni un'ondata di articoli e dichiarazioni su questo tema ha preso forma sui mass media. Tutto è partito dall'audizione in commissione bicamerale sulle banche del procuratore di Vicenza Antonio Cappelleri, il quale, dopo aver dichiarato che i vigilanti sono stati fuorviati da un gruppo di potere all'interno della popolare di Vicenza guidati dall'ex presidente Gianni Zonin, ha anche consegnato la lista di collaboratori della banca. Tra questi, 3 ex dipendenti dei Via Nazionale, tra cui anche un alto dirigente, Giannandrea Falchi, capo segreteria del Direttorio durante la gestione di Mario Draghi. Quanto basta per far scoppiare un fuoco di fila contro l'istituto, partito prima dal presidente Pd Matteo Orfini, e poi ribadito, anche se con toni diversi, dal presidente della commissione Pier Ferdinando Casini in un'intervista a La Repubblica. Casini parla di rischi per i vigilanti di essere ""catturati"" dai vigilati, rischi a cui guardare con attenzione. Più duri gli attacchi dem, che sui social diventano un'onda montante.

"" Tutta politica, e la tireranno pure per le lunghe nella convocazione del governatore"" dicono fonti vicine a Bankitalia, sospettando che non basterà neppure la precisazione appena diffusa, definita un ""fact checking"" da mettere a disposizione dei cittadini. Sicuramente sarà al calora bianco l'audizione in commissione del capo della Vigilanza Carmelo Barbagallo, fissata per giovedì 2 ottobre. Soprattutto dopo le esternazioni del presidente Casini, che i malevoli vogliono più legate a aspirazioni politiche personali (un seggio?). Ma la questione per Orfini non è affatto chiusa. ""Leggo che per Bankitalia non è un problema che si passi dall'organismo che vigila alle banche vigilate – twitta gelido il presidente dem – E questo spiega molte cose"". Se il fenomeno di ex Bankitalia passati a lavorare per istituti vigilati dovesse risultare esteso, significherebbe che c'è un vuoto normativo da colmare al più presto. Vuoto che finora Via Nazionale non ha segnalato. Per il parlamentare democrat, poi, sembra assurdo che si dica che il capo segreteria di un governatore non abbia fatto l'ispettore. ""Sarà pure vero, ma il suo ruolo implica funzioni di alto livello"". Quanto all'audizione di Visto, è probabile che sia collocata dopo essere passati dalle banche venete al Montepaschi.

Sie alle haben aus unterschiedlichen Gründen die Regierung verlassen

Doch eines haben ihre Geschichten gemeinsam: Sie zeigen, wie sehr Trump und seine Helfer das politische System verwüsten

Ich habe schon viele Trump-Hasser getroffen. Typen, die sich auf jede Verschwörungstheorie stürzen und US-Präsident Donald Trump nicht die geringste Chance geben.

Die vier Menschen, mit denen ich vor Kurzem einen Vormittag in Solly’s Tavern in Washington D. C. verbracht habe (ganz alkoholfrei, keine Sorge), hassen Trump nicht.

Aber sie haben sich von ihm abgewandt.

Sie alle haben irgendwann in den vergangenen neun Monaten beschlossen, ihre Stellen bei der Regierung zu kündigen, da sie der Meinung waren, ihrem Land außerhalb der Regierung besser dienen zu können.

Mit der Entscheidung waren sie nicht glücklich.

Sie waren Angestellte im öffentlichen Dienst und wollten auch weiterhin in diesem Sektor tätig sein. Bis auf eine Ausnahme hatten sie alle bereits für Präsidenten beider Parteien gearbeitet.

Sie waren mit ihren Vorgesetzten nicht immer einer Meinung, sie hatten Angst vor neuen Vorschriften und begegneten neuen politischen Gesichtern mit Vorsicht.

Und trotzdem sind sie immer geblieben, denn so ist das nun einmal, wenn man für die Regierung arbeitet.

Aber jetzt war es anders.

Wie bei einem Treffen alter Freunde

Als sich die vier vor zwei Wochen das erste Mal trafen, um die Situation zu diskutieren, stellten sie sofort fest, dass sie in vielen Punkten gleicher Meinung waren. Die Stimmung glich fast einem Wiedersehen alter Freunde nach vielen Jahren – mit dem kleinen Unterschied, dass sie sich erst fünf Minuten zuvor kennengelernt hatten.

Sie kamen aus verschiedenen Bereichen des Bürokratieapparates, sie waren unterschiedlich alt und auch ihre Lebensläufe hätten unterschiedlicher nicht sein können. Aber sie alle hatten sich seit Trumps Wahlsieg ähnliche Gedanken gemacht.

Würden sich die Arbeitskollegen hintergangen fühlen, wenn sie jetzt einfach so kündigten? Würden ihre freigewordenen Stellen mit jemandem besetzt werden, der eine gänzlich andere Meinung vertrat, eine Meinung, die sich von ihrer eigenen grundlegend unterschied?

Die meiste Zeit hatten sie im Hintergrund gearbeitet. Wie würde es sein, jetzt so in die Öffentlichkeit zu treten?

""Ich spürte eine große Angst""

Als das Interview, das zum besseren Verständnis redigiert und überarbeitet wurde, erst einmal lief, waren alle vier locker, zu Späßen aufgelegt und offen. Sie arbeiten vielleicht nicht mehr für die Regierung, aber sie sehen sich immer noch im Dienst der Öffentlichkeit.

Sharon McGowan bekleidete früher eine leitende Position im Bereich Bürgerrechte im Justizministerium. Sie arbeitete an der Umsetzung fortschrittlicher Politik, wie der Ehe für alle. Jetzt ist sie strategische Direktorin bei Lambda Legal.

Quelle: Stephen Voss

HuffPost: Sharon, du bist als erste geflohen. Fangen wir bei der Wahlnacht an: Was waren deine Gedanken? Wie hat es sich angefühlt?

Sharon McGowan: Ich verspürte eine große Angst, die ich auch körperlich fühlen konnte. Am Tag nach der Wahl beschlossen meine Frau und ich, zuhause zu bleiben, um uns als Familie neu aufzustellen. Als ein gleichgeschlechtliches Paar in diesem Land wussten wir sehr genau, was kommen würde.

Und in den ersten paar Tagen versuchte ich mit aller Macht, mich zu beruhigen: Vielleicht hatte Trump vieles gar nicht so gemeint. Vielleicht war das alles nur dem Wahlkampf geschuldet. Und das hat irgendwie auch funktioniert! Zumindest so lange, bis Jeff Sessions als Justizminister vorgeschlagen wurde. Da wusste ich, dass meine Tage bei der Regierung gezählt waren.

Du hattest keinen Zweifel daran, dass du gehen würdest?

McGowan: Doch, ich hatte auch Momente des Zweifels. Am Tag, als ich meine Kündigung eingereicht hatte, sagte die amtierende Justizministerin Sally Yates, dass sie den Einreisebann für Muslime nicht unterstützen würde.

Da kamen mir Zweifel, vielleicht hatte ich doch das Falsche getan. Vielleicht sollte ich doch bleiben. Doch wenig später wurde Sally Yates entlassen. Das sah ich als Zeichen des Universums, dass ich doch nicht vorschnell gehandelt hatte.

Walt, du bist bis zum Juli geblieben. Erzähle mir mal von dem Moment, als du erkannt hast, dass sich deine Welt fundamental verändert hatte.

Walter Shaub: Meine Geschichte ist etwas anders, denn ich wachte am Tag nach der Wahl auf und war bezüglich meiner Arbeit im Übergangsteam recht optimistisch. Seit fünf Monaten arbeiteten wir schon zusammen und es waren alles kluge und gewissenhafte Menschen.

Ich schickte also eine fröhliche Glückwunsch-E-Mail an die eine Seite und drückte der anderen Seite per E-Mail mein Bedauern aus. Von beiden erhielt ich eine Antwort, in der man mir für die Zusammenarbeit dankte.

Die Leute aus dem Trump-Team schrieben, dass sie sich darauf freuten, die gute Zusammenarbeit fortzusetzen und dass sie sich am Nachmittag melden würden, um einen Termin für das nächste Treffen festzulegen. Die Übergangszeit dauert ungefähr 73 Tage. So viel Zeit bleibt, um eine komplette Regierung aufzustellen.

Man muss genau wissen, was man tut, und man muss jede Sekunde nutzen. Es ist eine Mammutaufgabe. Aber bis zum Nachmittag waren all die Personen, mit denen wir bisher zusammengearbeitet hatten, verschwunden, und es herrschte Schweigen.

Später lasen wir in den Nachrichten, dass Don McGahn als Berater für die Übergangszeit im Gespräch war. (Don McGahn ist eine feste Größe in Washington D.C. und jetzt ein Berater im Weißen Haus, Anm. d. Red.) Aber es gelang uns eine ganze Zeit lang nicht, ein Treffen mit ihm zu auszumachen. Als es dann endlich zu dem Treffen kam, wurde schnell klar, wie ahnungslos er war.

Er fragte mich, ob ich derjenige sei, der für die Sicherheitsfreigabe verantwortlich sei oder ob ich die Hintergrundüberprüfung der möglichen neuen Regierungsmitglieder, die vom FBI durchgeführt wird, überwachen würde. Und ich erklärte McGahn, dass das nicht meine, sondern seine Aufgabe sei. Darauf folgte nur ein erstauntes ""Tatsächlich?“.

Aber der Höhe- oder vielmehr Tiefpunkt war dann, als Don McGahn eines Tages unauffindbar war. Aus der Zeitung erfuhren wir schließlich, dass er mit seiner Eightys-Coverband an diesem Tag einen Auftritt in Philadelphia hatte.

Quelle: Stephen Voss

Mike, Angestellte in der Umweltschutzbehörde haben mit politischen Personalentscheidungen oft zu kämpfen. Warum glaubst du, ist die Situation jetzt noch viel schwieriger?

Mike Cox: Ich habe unter sechs verschiedenen Präsidenten gearbeitet, von Ronald Reagan bis zu diesem hier, und es gab oft Meinungsverschiedenheiten. Aber niemals hatte ich das Gefühl, dass jemand neu in die Behörde kam, um diese auseinanderzunehmen.

Aber genau das Gefühl hat uns Scott Pruitt, der jetzige Direktor der Umweltschutzbehörde, vom ersten Tag an vermittelt. (Vierzehnmal hatte Scott Pruitt die Behörde vor seinem Amtsantritt bereits verklagt, Anm. d. Red) Er setzte eine Betriebsversammlung an und es war klar, dass er auf uns herabsah. Wir waren die EPA, die Umweltschutzbehörde. Wir waren die Bösen. Wir waren das Problem. Mein Gott, ich spreche von der EPA immer noch als ""uns“.

Die Gewohnheit legt man nur schwer ab.

Cox: Ja, das sind immer noch ""wir“. Der neue Direktor erklärte also, wir müssten mit den Bundesstaaten zusammenarbeiten. Ich habe dreißig Jahre in der Behörde gearbeitet und wir haben jeden Tag mit den Bundesstaaten zusammengearbeitet. Pruitt sagte, wir müssten uns an die Gesetze halten – als ob wir das nicht getan hätten.

Es war das fundamentale Gefühl, dass er unsere Arbeit nicht verstand. Oder falls er sie doch verstand, dass er es auf uns abgesehen hatte.

Das Zweite waren die Budgetkürzungen. Er verfolgte den Plan, die Stellen in der EPA um 30 Prozent zu kürzen. Außerdem sollten die Klimaschutzprogramme gestrichen werden.

Die Leute fragten sich, wie der Direktor der Umweltschutzbehörde nur erklären könne, der Klimaschutz sei kein Teil unserer Mission? Wir hatten das Gefühl, dass der Kern unserer Arbeit - ich möchte nicht ""zerstört“ sagen - aber untergraben werden sollte.

Zum Schluss möchte ich noch sagen, dass Pruitt Senator James Inhofes früheren Büroleiter eingestellt hat, um die Umweltschutzbehörde zu leiten. (Senator James Inhofe ist derjenige, der die globale Erwärmung ""widerlegt“ hat, indem er einen Schneeball mit in den Senat brachte. ""Es ist sehr sehr kalt draußen. Ganz untypisch für diese Jahreszeit“, so Inhofe, Anm. d. Red).

Das hat mir gereicht. Mann, das ist wirklich übel.

Gab es einen bestimmten ""Jetzt reicht es, ich kündige!“-Moment?

Cox: Ich will ganz ehrlich sein. Im Februar sollte ich in Rente gehen. Ich war fest davon überzeugt, dass Hillary Clinton gewinnen würde, ich dann in Rente gehen und jemand anderes meine Arbeit zum Klimawandel weiterführen würde. Alles wäre großartig.

Dann gewann Trump, und als ich mich auf meinen Ruhestand vorbereitete, kamen immer mehr Menschen auf mich zu und sagten ""Mike, du kannst jetzt nicht in Rente gehen. Dein Job fällt dann weg und du bist ein Verfechter des Klimaschutzes, wir brauchen dich.“

Letztendlich entschied ich mich doch für den Ruhestand. Und das bereue ich ehrlich gesagt. Ich wünschte, ich wäre geblieben. Auch wenn ich glaube, dass ich nicht viel hätte bewirken können, so wäre ich doch eine Stimme gewesen. Und wenn man mich entlassen hätte, dann wäre das in Ordnung gewesen.

Ned, wie auch Walt arbeitest du für eine Institution, die eigentlich über der Politik steht. Aber Spannungen mit einer neuen Regierung sind nichts Ungewöhnliches bei der CIA. Warum war das jetzt etwas Anderes?

Ned Price: Während der Übergangszeit von Bush zu Obama habe ich am Counterterrorism Center, dem Anti-Terror-Zentrum, gearbeitet. Ich habe mich immer für einen sehr fortschrittlichen Menschen gehalten, besonders, was soziale Belange betraf.

Aber die Wahlkampf-Rhetorik des damaligen Präsidentschaftskandidaten Barack Obama löste bei mir manches Mal Unbehagen aus. Ich hatte die Befürchtung, dass die Taktiken und die Strategien, die uns so große Erfolge im Kampf gegen Gruppen wie Al-Kaida eingebracht hatten, geändert werden könnten, und dass der CIA und andere Sicherheitsorganisationen in diesem Kampf so die Hände gebunden wären.

Aber wir stellten fest, dass Präsident Obama jemand war, der tat, was getan werden musste. Und dabei blieb er immer noch seinen Kernüberzeugungen treu. Überzeugungen, denen, so denke ich, auch viele von uns zustimmten: Ein Ende der Bestrafungstaktik und der klare Standpunkt, dass die CIA nichts tun würde, was auch nur im Entferntesten als Folter beschrieben werden könnte.

Spulen wir also mal vor bis zum Januar. Was war das für eine Erfahrung?

Price: Für mich begann es schon während des Wahlkampfes, als ich hörte, dass der Präsidentschaftskandidat Donald Trump die Geheimdienste wiederholt sehr scharf attackierte und angriff. Es war nicht nur die Tatsache, dass er Wikileaks zitierte. Es war auch nicht nur die Tatsache, dass er die Geheimdienste mit den Nazis verglich. Das alles kann man noch als rhetorische Ausschmückungen abtun.

Aber er schob hoch-vertrauliche Analysen der Geheimdienste zu Themen wie dem russischen Eingreifen in die Wahl einfach beiseite und bezeichnete sie als Fake News, als einen Witz.

Dass er der großen Verantwortung, die das Amt des Obersten Befehlshabers mit sich bringt, nicht den geringsten Respekt zollte, wurde besonders deutlich, als er am ersten Tag seiner Amtszeit das Hauptquartier der CIA in Langley besuchte.

Er stand vor der Memory Wall - der Wand, die an die CIA-Officer erinnert, die im Dienst ihr Leben gelassen hatten - und sprach über die Zuschauermenge bei seiner Amtseinführung. Er machte Witze darüber, in den Irak zurückzukehren und den Irakern das Öl zu stehlen. Einer meiner Mentoren hat auch einen Platz an dieser Wand, ebenso wie viele ehemalige Kollegen.

Ab wann hast du darüber nachgedacht, zu kündigen?

Price: Das Fass zum Überlaufen brachte für mich das Memorandum, das Steve Bannon als Chef des Nationalen Sicherheitsrates vorsah. Damit wurden der Direktor der CIA wie auch der Vorsitzende der Joint Chiefs of Staff, der Stabschefs, einem militärischen Beratungsgremium des US-Präsidenten, aus dem Principals Committee, der innere Kreis der Sicherheitsrats, entfernt.

Für mich stand fest, dass ich es hier mit einer Regierung zu tun haben würde, die auf politische Berater und Ideologen setzte. Als Analytiker des Geheimdienstes würde ich von nun an entweder den ganzen Tag nur Däumchen drehen oder Berichte verfassen, die allerhöchstens bessere Staubfänger waren.

""Ich befürchtete, dass ich nur noch Schönfärberei betreiben würde, um Korruption zu verbergen.“ – Walter Shaub

Was ist all diesen Geschichten gemein?

McGowan: Ich denke, man bemühte sich, für jede Regierungsbehörde den Kandidaten für die Leitungsebene auszuwählen, der für die Behörde am unangenehmsten sein würde. Es war das dekonstruktive Mantra, den jeweiligen Behörden zu signalisieren, wie wenig man die Arbeit und die Mitarbeiter wertschätzt.

Cox: Ich vergleiche das hier nicht mit dem Auftritt bei der Memorial Wall, aber der Präsident kam im März für einen Besuch in die Umweltschutzbehörde. Am Tag seines Besuches ging an alle Mitarbeiter eine Mitteilung raus: Der Tag wurde ""Unser großer Tag“ genannt werden.

Weiter stand darin, dass der Präsident alle Klimaschutzmaßnahmen, die unter Barack Obama erarbeitet worden waren, rückgängig machen würde. Und dass sollte ""Unser großer Tag“ sein?

McGowan: Richtig, aber wer ist hier ""unser“?

Cox: Ein weiterer roter Faden, der sich offenbar durch all unsere Erfahrungen zieht, ist, dass es sich hier um Menschen handelt, die nicht interessiert sind an anderen Meinungen.

Oft wurde nach Hintergrundinformationen zu einem bestimmten Thema gefragt, es sollte Folgetreffen geben. Diese Treffen fanden aber nie statt.

Als es an der Zeit war, eine Entscheidung zu treffen, haben Pruitt und seine engsten Mitarbeiter einfach getan, was sie ohnehin tun wollten und das war’s. Und die Umweltschutzbehörde ist eine wissenschaftliche Organisation! Wir müssen Fakten zu schätzen wissen! Selbst während der Bush-Präsidentschaft war es anders.

Price: Die Gemeinsamkeit, die mir sofort auffällt, ist, das keiner von uns in diese Situation geraten wollte. Wenn ich mal von mir selbst spreche, dann kann ich sagen, dass ich meine Arbeit geliebt habe. Ich war sehr zufrieden mit der Aussicht, für den Rest meines Lebens ein Bürokrat zu sein. Und ich hoffe, dass ich in den öffentlichen Dienst zurückkehren kann, wenn sich die Großwetterlage gebessert hat.

Shaub: Ich glaube, meine Erfahrung unterscheidet sich da etwas. Oder zumindest mein Fokus. Ich bin nicht so auf die politische Perspektive fokussiert. Meine Sorge gilt dem, was ich den ""Container"" nenne. Ich sehe die repräsentativen Strukturen der Regierung als den Container, die Politik ist das, was man in dem Container lagert.

Mich beunruhigt der Angriff auf diesen Container. Wenn man einen Präsidenten hat, der immer seine finanziellen Interessen im Auge behält, dann weiß man nie, worauf sich seine Entscheidungen gründen, selbst wenn man ihn unterstützt.

Und das wird besonders deutlich, wenn man sieht, wie er den türkischen Präsidenten Erdogan dafür lobt, dass er seine Macht immer weiter ausbaut oder den mörderischen Präsidenten der Philippinen, Rodrigo Duterte, nach Washington einlädt. Trump hat immer noch Immobilieninteressen in der Türkei und auf den Philippinen.

Aber eine Gemeinsamkeit, die mir auffällt, ist der Unwille, auf Experten zu hören. Wir haben an Lösungen gearbeitet. Lasst uns also nochmal auf die finanziellen Interessen des Präsidenten zurückkommen. Ich habe wiederholt gesagt, dass er seine Immobilien verkaufen müsse. Aber selbst wenn er sich geweigert hätte, hätten wir eine Lösung finden können, den größten Schaden zu begrenzen.

Es hätte zum Beispiel kein Regierungsmitarbeiter an einer Veranstaltung teilnehmen dürfen, die in einer Immobilie stattfindet, die zur Trump-Marke oder Trump persönlich gehört. Das hätte vielleicht auch Kuwait, Bahrain oder andere Länder davon abgehalten, dort Veranstaltungen abzuhalten.

Es hätte vielleicht auch Politiker und Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen davon abgehalten, dort zu Benefizveranstaltungen einzuladen, denn sie hätten gewusst, dass kein einziger Mitarbeiter aus dem Weißen Haus gekommen wäre.

Wir hätten außerdem empfehlen können, dass der Präsident sich am bisherigen Umgang mit Vetternwirtschaft orientiert, statt dass das Justizministerium seine über Jahrzehnte gefestigte Haltung zur Vetternwirtschaft über den Haufen wirft.

Wenn also das Weiße Haus mir den Schwarzen Peter zuschiebt und behauptet, ich hätte versucht, sie zu untergraben, dann sage ich: Wenn sie sich an meine Empfehlungen gehalten hätten, dann wären sie in einer stärkeren Position gewesen.

Quelle: Stephen Voss

Walt, ich habe gehört, dass du eine mentale Check-Liste hattest, die dir bei deiner Entscheidung helfen sollte?

Shaub: Ja, es handelte sich dabei um eine Checkliste aus drei Teilen, die ich auch anderen empfehle. Zuerst die Frage: Kann ich die Mission effektiv erfüllen? Dann die Frage: Kann ich meine Arbeit ethisch und moralisch verrichten? Und die dritte Frage: Kann ich die Wahrheit sagen?

Ich habe mich sicherlich nie gescheut, die Wahrheit zu sagen. Ich hatte auch das Gefühl, dass ich meine Mission moralisch und ethisch gut erfüllt habe. Aber ich war an einem Punkt angelangt, an dem ich das Gefühl hatte, die Mission nicht effektiv erfüllen zu können. Diese Frage habe ich mir über Monate hinweg gestellt. Und ich bin geblieben, denn ich hatte das Gefühl, dass noch nicht alles verloren war.

Zum Beispiel hört man trotz dieser ganzen Privat-Jet-Sache (Shaun bezieht sich auf die offensichtliche Allergie einiger Kabinettsmitglieder gegen kommerzielle Flüge, Anm. d. Red) gar nichts über den finanziellen Interessenkonflikt einiger Kabinettsmitglieder. Das liegt daran, dass das OGE, das Büro für Regierungsethik, auch ohne die Unterstützung des Weißen Hauses Erfolg hatte.

Ich habe persönlich mit einem Kandidaten gesprochen, der unheimlich wohlhabend und erfolgreich ist, und ich sagte ihm: ""Sie sind zu Ihrem Ruhm und Wohlstand gekommen, weil Sie ein begabter Verhandlungsführer sind. Aber das Schlimmste, was Ihnen jetzt passieren könnte, ist, dass Sie all Ihre Fähigkeiten nutzen und mich erfolgreich dazu bewegen, mich zurückzuziehen.“

Letztendlich stimmte die Person zu, den Großteil ihres Besitzes zu veräußern. Das war keine einfache Entscheidung für diese Person und ich rechne es ihr sehr hoch an.

Andere Kabinettsmitglieder waren uns gegenüber feindseliger eingestellt. Aber letztendlich waren wir im Umgang mit ihnen voll in unserem Element. Außerdem hatten wir in den von den Kabinettsmitgliedern selbst bezahlten Anwälten Verbündete, die ihnen rieten, dass das ein sehr sinnvolles Vorgehen sei.

Einen ähnlichen Erfolg hatten wir, als wir darum kämpften, die Ethik-Ausnahmegenehmigungen, die das Weiße Haus ausstellte, in unseren Besitz zu bekommen. (Diese Ausnahmegenehmigungen erlauben es Regierungsmitarbeitern, bestimmte Ethikvorschriften zu umgehen. Die Trump-Regierung hat einige dieser Papiere heimlich ausgehändigt, Anm. d. Red)

Das Weiße Haus hat sich gegen uns einen Monat lang in aller Öffentlichkeit gewehrt, aber letztendlich war der Druck der Öffentlichkeit zu groß und die Ausnahmegenehmigungen wurden uns ausgehändigt.

Die größte Überraschung folgte aber, als ich die Papiere zu Gesicht bekam. Viele waren nicht unterschrieben, nicht datiert und entweder explizit oder implizit rückwirkend. Wenn man eine rückwirkende Ausnahmegenehmigung benötigt, dann heißt das, dass man ein Gesetzt gebrochen hat.

Zusätzlich waren zwei der Papiere für eine Gruppe von Angestellten bestimmt, zu denen auch die Person gehörte, die die Dokumente ausstellte. Diese Person hat sich also selbst eine Ausnahmegenehmigung ausgestellt.

Da begriff ich, dass diesen Menschen einfach alles zuzutrauen war. Und sie hatten sich darauf vorbereitet, dass ich mit den Verstößen an die Öffentlichkeit gehen würde, indem sie das Ethikbüro einfach ausschalteten.

Das brachte mich in die Position, dass ich einige veröffentlichungspflichtige Angaben zum Einkommen von Mitarbeitern des Weißen Hauses würde zertifizieren müssen, ohne zu wissen, womit diese Personen tatsächlich ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienen. Ich befürchtete, einen Deckmantel über Korruption breiten zu müssen.

Wie ist die Beziehung zu euren früheren Kollegen jetzt?

McGowan: Seit ich gekündigt habe, habe ich viele E-Mails bekommen. Nicht nur von meinen Kollegen aus der Abteilung für Bürgerrechte, sondern auch von anderen Mitarbeitern. Sie alle sagten mir, dass sie so froh sind, dass ich diesen Weg gegangen bin.

Viele wollen ebenfalls kündigen, aber das ist eine so schwierige und persönliche Entscheidung. Manche sind die Alleinverdiener in ihren Familien. Andere machen sich Sorgen, wer ihren Platz einnehmen könnte, wenn sie tatsächlich gehen.

Manche beschreiben die aktuelle Situation tatsächlich wie ein Ertrinken: Wie lange kann ich meinen Kopf noch über Wasser halten? Ich möchte die Scherben gerne wieder zusammensetzen, wenn all das hier einmal vorbei ist.

Wenn ich mit meinen ehemaligen Kollegen über meine Entscheidung spreche, dann tue ich das schweren Herzens und mit sehr viel Feingefühl, denn ich möchte nicht leichtfertig und überheblich wirken. Ich wusste einfach, dass ich mit meiner Arbeit und meiner Leidenschaft in einer Stelle, die sich stärker durch Widerstand auszeichnet, mehr erreichen könnte.

Ich erkannte auch, dass ich ein großes Privileg hatte. Ich weiß, dass viele, die noch in diesem Apparat arbeiten, damit zu kämpfen haben, sich ihre Integrität und ihren Stolz zu bewahren. Ich finde es wichtig, sie zu ermutigen und sie wissen zu lassen, dass sie das Gute und Richtige in der Welt nicht verraten.

""Ich wünschte, ich wäre geblieben. Denn auch, wenn ich vielleicht nicht viel hätte ausrichten können, so wäre ich doch eine Stimme gewesen.“ – Mike Cox

Price: Ich war in einer ähnlichen Situation. Als ich bereit war zu kündigen, machte ich mir keine Gedanken um die Trolle auf Twitter oder darüber, wie die Personen in der gegenwärtigen Regierung reagieren würden. Die meisten Sorgen mache ich mir darum, dass meine früheren Kollegen denken könnten, ich hielte mich für heiliger als der Papst.

Es ist daher unheimlich schön, dass sie mich immer noch als ein Teammitglied betrachten. Für sie bin ich jemand, der immer noch ihre Interessen verfolgt.

Shaub: Für mich gleicht das eher einem kalten Entzug. 15 Jahre habe ich mit diesen Menschen zusammengearbeitet. Und auch wenn ich theoretisch natürlich weiterhin zu ihnen Kontakt haben darf, so habe ich doch Angst davor, dass ein Foto in der Zeitung erscheinen könnte, das uns bei einem gemeinsamen Lunch zeigt und man mich beschuldigen könnte, geheime Informationen weiterzugeben.

Deshalb bleibe ich auf Abstand. Ich vermisse sie einfach nur sehr, das ist der menschliche Faktor hier.

Cox: Ich habe eine Frage: Kommen Mitarbeiter deiner Organisation mit der Bitte auf dich zu, eine bestimmte Sache näher zu erläutern?

Price: Meine ehemaligen Kollegen sind in einer schwierigen Situation, denn sie werden in geheime Angelegenheiten eingeweiht und ich nicht. Und natürlich haben sie keine geheimen Informationen an mich weitergegeben, aber sie sprechen über allgemeinere Dinge wie die Arbeitsmoral in der Geheimdienstgemeinde, was sich in Personaldingen im Nationalen Sicherheitsrat tut, oder wo es auch im Weißen Haus zu Unklarheiten kommt.

Was ich feststelle, ist eine tiefsitzende Paranoia. Niemand schreibt mir einfach so mal oder ruft kurz an. Sie beginnen eine Unterhaltung damit, zu fragen, ob ich bei Signal oder bei WhatsApp bin. Such dir einen verschlüsselten Messenger aus, sagen sie. Am nächsten Tag bekomme ich dann eine Nachricht bei Signal mit dem Wortlaut ""Hey wie geht’s, ich wollte nur mal kurz Hallo sagen.“

Shaub: Sie sprechen nur über persönliche Dinge?

Price: Genau. Es werden keine geheimen oder sensiblen Informationen ausgeplaudert.

McGowan: Da ist immer das Gefühl, dass es schon beängstigend ist, nur mit jemandem gesehen zu werden, der gekündigt hat.

""Ich war sehr zufrieden mit der Aussicht, für den Rest meines Lebens ein Bürokrat zu sein. Und ich hoffe, dass ich in den öffentlichen Dienst zurückkehren kann, wenn sich die Großwetterlage gebessert hat.“ – Ned Price

Gab es wenigstens ein wenig guten Galgenhumor, bevor du gegangen bist?

McGowan: In der Woche nach der Wahl habe ich einem Freund von mir geschrieben. Mit ihm bin ich auch schon einmal aneinander geraten. Ich habe ihn gefragt, ob er schon an seinem Korematsu arbeitet. (Ein umstrittener Fall des Obersten Gerichtshofs. Der US-Regierung wurde es gestattet, während des Zweiten Weltkriegs japanisch-stämmige Amerikaner in Lagern zu internieren, Anm. d. Red.)

""Das ist nicht witzig“ war seine Antwort. Und ich sagte: ""Ich weiß, dass das nicht witzig ist.“

Ich frage mich, ob das abschreckend auf junge Menschen wirken könnte, die eine Karriere im öffentlichen Dienst anstreben.

McGowan: Ich werde nicht müde zu betonen, was für ein toller Job die Regierungsarbeit ist und wie viele Möglichkeiten sie einem bietet. Zumindest war das bei mir der Fall. Immer, wenn jemand von der Regierung als 'The Man' spricht, dann antwortete ich scherzhaft, dass der Mann anscheinend eine 1,60 Meter große Lesbe aus Queens ist. Wenn ich also 'The Man' sein kann, dann kann das jeder.

Aber jetzt ist es sehr viel schwieriger geworden, Menschen davon zu überzeugen, dass die Arbeit für die Regierung eine wirkliche Erfüllung sein kann.

Ich weiß, dass die Macht der Bundesregierung dazu genutzt wird, so viel Schlimmes anzurichten, zum Beispiel Familien auseinanderzureißen oder zu diskriminieren. Da finde ich es sehr unsensibel, jetzt bei jemandem für die Regierungsarbeit zu werben, der selber zu der Gruppe Menschen gehört, die unter den Entscheidungen der Regierung leidet. Ich freue mich schon auf den Tag, an dem das alles wieder vorbei ist.

Shaub: Mir bereitet diese Abschreckung große Sorgen. Ich möchte hier die Gelegenheit ergreifen, junge Menschen zu ermutigen, eine Karriere im öffentlichen Dienst anzustreben. Es gibt so viele verschiedene Möglichkeiten. Es gibt regionale Regierungen, die Regierungen der Bundesstaaten, Non-Profit-Organisationen und natürlich die Bundesregierung.

Die Arbeit für die Regierung kann ich immer noch sehr empfehlen. Junge Menschen beginnen hier auf einer niedrigen Stufe, aus einigen Turbulenzen werden sie so herausgehalten. Aber trotzdem übernehmen sie schon früh eine sehr große Verantwortung. Und sie können wirklich etwas erreichen, indem sie sich dem Dienst für ein ganzes Land verschreiben.

Der öffentliche Dienst ist wirklich eine Belohnung an sich. Also, ich zahle immer noch meinen Studentenkredit ab, da will ich doch schwer hoffen, dass sich der öffentliche Dienst bezahlt macht.

Zuvor waren Vorwürfe gegen Hauptdarsteller Kevin Spacey laut geworden

Der Streaming-Dienst Netflix hat angekündigt, die Erfolgsserie ""House of Cards"" nach der sechsten Staffel einzustellen.

Zuvor waren Vorwürfe gegen Hauptdarsteller Kevin Spacey bekannt geworden. Der Oscargewinner soll 1986 einen 14-Jährigen sexuell belästigt haben.

Netflix und die Produzenten von ""House of Cards"" teilten mit, sie seien ""tief beunruhigt"" von den Vorwürfen gegen Spacey. In einer gemeinsamen Mitteilung berichteten die Verantwortlichen, sie hätten die Enthüllungen um Spacey am Montag mit den Schauspielern und der Filmcrew besprochen. Spacey sei nicht auf dem Filmset gewesen.

Die Entscheidung, die Serie einzustellen, sei allerdings schon vor Monaten gefallen, sagte eine Person, die mit der Situation vertraut sei, der Nachrichtenagentur AP.

Spacey outete sich als schwul

Schauspieler Anthony Rapp hatte Spacey in einem Interview eines sexuellen Übergriffs beschuldigt. Er selbst sei bei den Vorgängen 14 Jahre alt gewesen, Spacey schon 26.

Spacey habe ihn im Jahr 1986 nach einer Party in seinem New Yorker Apartment auf sein Bett gelegt und sei auf ihn gestiegen, sagte der heute 46-jährige Rapp dem Magazin ""Buzzfeed News"". Er habe sich aus der Umklammerung ""herauswinden"" können und die Wohnung verlassen. Auf Twitter antwortete Spacey, er könne sich an den Vorfall ""ehrlich nicht erinnern"".

Spacey nahm die Vorwürfe zum Anlass, sich als schwul zu outen. ""Ich habe mein ganzes Leben über Männer geliebt und romantische Begegnungen mit ihnen gehabt, und jetzt entscheide ich mich dafür, als schwuler Mann zu leben"", schrieb der Oscarpreisträger in der Nacht zu Montag auf Twitter.

These heroes rarely make headlines, yet without them most of the United Nations goals would be unachievable. In honour of World UN Day this month, we raise our glasses to its least recognized champions — the statisticians.

These bean counters are changing the world.

""Counting counts. If we're not counting, we can't see where the gaps are and what we've accomplished,"" says Kathryn White, president and CEO of the UN Association in Canada.

UN statisticians gather unimaginable reams of data that shape national and global policy in every imaginable area. Their calculations can alter our understanding of global issues.

Perceptions about the role of women and the economy in developing regions changed drastically when UN statisticians delved deep into gender-specific stats in the early 1990s, White says.

Previously, poverty-fighting initiatives rarely considered gender. But crunched numbers indicated that targeted investment in women's empowerment had a major impact on poverty and other social issues. Every additional year that a girl attends school results in a 9.5-per-cent decrease in child mortality. Increasing income for women results in better education and health for children; they are more likely than men to use resources to benefit the whole family.

Governments and development organizations shifted focus to women's empowerment.

Studies also showed that men tended to hoard food aid rations for sale, while women were more likely to share it with their families, leading to better child nutrition. So food aid programs began working directly with women wherever possible.

The UN's flagship statistical document, the annual Human Development Report, launched in 1990, has inspired more than 140 countries to engage in similar statistical self-examination, supported by the UN, with big benefits. During Uganda's AIDS epidemic, better data tracked factors that spread the disease, leading to programs that have significantly reduced the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The country of Jordan identified its most impoverished districts, and targeted them with employment and development programs, boosting quality of life.

Today, the UN Statistics Division partners with more than 30 national statistics agencies around the world, building and mining big data that will help both the UN and individual countries develop policies and programs to address social and environmental issues. For example, together the UN and Statistics Canada developed indexes on remoteness and accessibility to services like health care and transportation. These will help future programs for hard-to-reach rural and northern communities.

""We need to ensure that everyone is counted, especially the most poor and vulnerable. We need local statistics to ensure that every child has access to education and we need global statistics to monitor the overall effects of climate change,"" said Ban Ki-moon, former UN Secretary General, in a statement for World Statistics Day earlier this month.

So here's to the analysts, the number-crunchers and the bean counters of the UN. The knowledge they provide promotes world change.

Despite action being taken by countries across the globe, the report states that these unprecedented levels will lead to huge changes in climate systems causing “severe ecological and economic disruptions.” The report uses data collected by research stations in over 50 countries around the globe including Antarctica. These findings are designed to be an early warning system for the planet allowing us to potentially avert irreversible changes in the climate. Despite this CO2 levels have continued to rise thanks to increase agriculture, population growth and the continued burning of fossil fuels on a massive scale. “Without rapid cuts in CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, we will be heading for dangerous temperature increases by the end of this century, well above the target set by the Paris climate change agreement,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “Future generations will inherit a much more inhospitable planet, “ he said.

The problem with CO2 is that there is no quick solution to the problem, it remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and even longer in the oceans. What that means is that even if we start trying to fix the problem now the simple fact is we’re still going to have to deal with the consequences of our actions. “There is currently no magic wand to remove this CO 2 from the atmosphere,”said Mr Taalas. According to the report, the last time the Earth experienced these levels of CO2 was some 3.5 million years ago.

Spend time in the home of Vancouver Indigenous Fashion Week with Venture Far's 'Where To Begin In Vancouver?'","From the moment we first began wearing clothing -- very roughly between 100,000 and 500,000 years ago -- certain garments became endowed with special meaning. Whether they represented status, provided identification or served as pure ornamentation, fashion has been able to tell a story.

And so it is with the style of Canada's Aboriginal peoples. But being one of the oldest civilisations on the planet, the wealth of tribal stories and tradition interwoven in native costume has been utilised in high street and high end fashion in ways that has often been deemed inappropriate by Canada's Aboriginal communities.

As a response to this cultural appropriation, a few months ago the first ever Indigenous Fashion Week was held in Vancouver -- an effort by the country's First Peoples to kickstart a reclamation of their heritage.

What Is The History Of Indigenous Culture And Style In Canada?

A post shared by VIFW (@vancouverindigenousfashionweek) on Jul 20, 2017 at 11:02pm PDT

The history of Aboriginal peoples in Canada stretches back some 14,000 years -- long before the arrival of the first Europeans. And the rich tapestry of unique histories, languages, cultural practices and beliefs from the country's First Peoples is still vibrant. Nowhere is this more apparent than in their striking fashions.

Aboriginal style has been part and parcel of mainstream fashion globally for many years -- native patterns and headdresses have been a staple in pop culture and the pages of fashion magazines for close to a century. But what many non-Indigenous people may not realise is that, while the fashion world has an appetite for native designs, by and large it hasn't been expressed tastefully or respectfully.

High street brands across the globe have utilised traditional dress in their collections, though such dress often has a sacred meaning behind it. And this issue is becoming increasingly controversial.

""Cultural Appropriation is a touchy subject,"" designer and founder of label EMME and exhibitor at VIFW, Korina Emmerich said. ""While I don't feel it comes from racism, I do feel it comes from a place of ignorance. So I urge people to do their research.

""We need to keep the conversation going about why it's not ok to wear a headdress, why it's not ok to call something a 'navajo' print. The more actual Indigenous designers that are represented in fashion, film and media, the more it will be respected.""

Growing up in the Yukon Territory, Aboriginal designer Sho Sho Esquiro is very aware of the history that is woven into the clothing she makes.

""My tribe has -- for thousands of years -- survived in the harsh temperatures, this meant of course making our clothes with the highest quality,"" she said. ""Being raised around people who sew and hunters I gained an appreciation and love for the craftsmanship of our textiles, so I'm just carrying on our tradition.""

It's this authenticity that contemporary Indigenous fashion highlights. The antithesis of mass-produced, fast-fashion, more and more people are discovering and engaging with these handcrafted native designs.

What Is Vancouver Indigenous Fashion Week?

A post shared by VIFW (@vancouverindigenousfashionweek) on Sep 26, 2017 at 8:32pm PDT

Held in July 2017 in Vancouver, the inaugural Vancouver Indigenous Fashion Week (VIFW) was created as a response to cultural appropriation and as a way to show consumers who appreciate native style that they can wear it respectfully, by buying from First Nations designers.

Spanning four days, the fashion event profiled both Aboriginal designers and models -- many of whom were formerly in foster care and are participants of the Pacific Association of First Nations Women's youth camps.

Affiliated with the Puyallup tribe, which is based in Washington state, Emmerich was included In Vancouver's Indigenous Fashion Week to represent the inclusion of all coastal Salish tribes, noting that their ancestral land was without borders.

""I think Vancouver Indigenous Fashion Week is incredibly important to highlight Indigenous designers,"" Emmerich said. ""Many designers today are inspired by Indigenous regalia, but often miss the mark on representing it in an appropriate and respectful way.

""Opportunities like VIFW provide a very much needed spotlight on our culture. I feel very honoured to carry on our traditions and culture in a contemporary way. To continue to sew, quill, bead and honour those traditional ways is a way of life for me,"" Esquiro said.

""I feel that the more our community engages with mainstream media, the more positive effect it will have by creating awareness about culture appropriation, as well as supporting native fashion. Buying from the source is becoming more accessible -- it's an exciting time to be a Indigenous designer and artist!""

Plans are already shaping up to make VIFW an annual event.

Which Designers Should You Look Out For?

A post shared by 🔺EMME🔺 (@korinaemmerich) on Oct 12, 2017 at 12:37pm PDT

Combining the use of natural materials and traditional handicraft methods with a contemporary aesthetic, many of the collections showed at the inaugural VIFW paid tribute to the designers' heritage and ancestral homeland.

Some of the emerging and established labels that to keep an eye on include Emmerich's, EMME line. Hailing from the Pacific Northwest, Emmerich is one of the more established artists to have designs featured on the Indigenous Fashion Week catwalk. The New York based designer has competed in the U.S 'Project Runway' and shown at Mercedez Benz Fashion Week In New York.

""My personal work is heavily influenced by modern powwow regalia and the bright colours used,"" Emmerich said. ""Plus, how Indigenous craft has inspired modern art today.""

Esquiro creates contemporary designs using traditional techniques with recycled textiles and ethically sourced wool, fur and leather. She's also one of the few Canadian Aboriginal fashion designers getting attention internationally, recently becoming the first native designer to take part in the first ever fashion show on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

""Opportunities like this are things that a girl from a small community, like myself, could never dream of,"" Esquiro said.

Shannon Kilroy's Earthline Fashions is inspired by the traditions and legends of her tribe, the Nlaka'pamux Nation people from southern British Columbia. Born into a family of artists and seamstresses, the colour palette of her designs reflect the landscape of her birthplace and the embellishment of feathers, fringing and embroidery is also a nod to her heritage.

Meanwhile, in menswear, Curtis Oland is a label to look out for. Named 'top emerging talent' at last year's Toronto Men's Fashion Week, Oland draws inspiration from his Lil'wat First Nation heritage.

Dabei streiten wir nicht über die Lehren des Islam, sondern nur über Zerrbilder

Im Kampf gegen den Terrorismus kommt der Westen daher nicht weiter

Wenn mich jemand vor zehn Jahren gefragt hätte, ob die Deutschen jemals noch einmal zum Hass auf eine religiöse Minderheit fähig sein würden, hätte ich ihn für verrückt erklärt.

Das sogenannte ""Sommermärchen"" war gerade vorbei, die Bundesrepublik hatte den ""Partypatriotismus"" für sich entdeckt, eine Art Nationalstolz light, ohne die alten Konservierungsstoffe.

Und obwohl auch vor zehn Jahren schon Anzeichen für eine populärer werdende ""neue Bürgerlichkeit"" zu erkennen waren, war von allen denkbaren Themen die Religion am untauglichsten, um Massen zu mobilisieren.

Die Zeiten haben sich geändert. Spätestens seit dem 24. Oktober 2017 ist der Islamhass in der Mitte aller Debatten angekommen.

Wenn Islamhasser im Bundestag sitzen

An diesem Tag fand die konstituierende Sitzung des neuen Bundestages statt. Und inmitten der ersten rhetorisch-radikalen Anklänge von Seiten der AfD-Fraktion wurde klar, dass wir uns in Zukunft nicht mehr vor den Irren wegducken können.

Wenn Islamhasser im Bundestag sitzen, haben ihre Äußerungen so viel Gewicht, dass wir uns damit zumindest auseinandersetzen müssen.

Das ist zum Beispiel der hessische AfD-Politiker Albrecht Glaser. Er sollte nach dem Willen seiner Fraktion zum Vizepräsidenten des Deutschen Bundestags gewählt werden. Was nicht gelang. Glaser scheiterte in drei Wahldurchgängen.

Mitschuld daran dürfte ein Satz aus einer Wahlkampfrede Glasers sein. ""Der Islam ist eine Konstruktion, die selbst die Religionsfreiheit nicht kennt und die sie nicht respektiert. Und die da, wo sie das Sagen hat, jede Art von Religionsfreiheit im Keim erstickt. Und wer so mit einem Grundrecht umgeht, dem muss man das Grundrecht entziehen"", sagte Glaser im April.

Mit anderen Worten: Glaser möchte den Muslimen in Deutschland die Grundrechte einschränken. Überflüssig zu erwähnen, dass dies nicht geht, so lange das Grundgesetz in Kraft ist – Religionsfreiheit und die Gleichheit der Menschen vor dem Gesetz sind unabänderlich. Das ist eine Lehre aus der deutschen Geschichte.

Man darf ohne Übertreibung davon reden, dass Glasers Einlassungen sich direkt gegen die verfassungsmäßige Ordnung in Deutschland richten.

Wir streiten über Zerrbilder des Islam

Der Streit um Albrecht Glaser war nur die jüngste populistische Stilblüte in der Debatte darüber, wie man dem radikalen Islamismus in Deutschland wirkungsvoll entgegen treten kann.

Die diskursive Dominanz der Radikalen führt jedoch schon seit den Silvester-Übergriffen von Köln dazu, dass wir nicht mehr über die Bekämpfung des Radikalismus reden, sondern nur noch über Zerrbilder des Islam.

Nicht nur in der AfD wird der Islam bisweilen als ""Ideologie"" bezeichnet. Der Begriff signalisiert, dass Muslime sich keineswegs auf die Ausübung der Religionsfreiheit berufen können. Weil sie ja dieser Lesart folgend keiner Religion anhängen.

Es gibt gute Gründe, sich aus ethisch-moralischen Gründen darüber zu empören. Natürlich ist es dreist, intolerant, chauvinistisch und antidemokratisch, einer Gemeinschaft von über einer Milliarde Menschen das Recht absprechen zu wollen, einer Religion anzuhängen.

Vor allem aber ist es unfassbar ignorant und führt dazu, dass der Kampf gegen den Terrorismus in der westlichen Welt seit 16 Jahren nicht wesentlich vorwärts gekommen ist.

Wir müssen endlich verstehen lernen, was junge Menschen in die Arme der Radikalen treibt. Was sie dort suchen und finden. Und natürlich auch, wie Religion für politische Zwecke missbraucht wird.

Es dauerte nur drei Monate, bis Oliver radikalisiert war

Ich hatte die Gelegenheit, mit dem ehemaligen IS-Angehörigen Oliver N. ein Buch zu schreiben, das im Oktober unter dem Titel ""Meine falschen Brüder"" bei Kiepenheuer und Witsch erschienen ist.

Oliver war gerade 16 geworden, als ihn ein Freund aus Kindertagen in eine radikal-islamistische Gemeinde in Wien mitnahm. Es dauerte nur drei Monate, bis Oliver so weit radikalisiert war, dass er nach Syrien ausreiste, um dort beim Aufbau des ""Kalifats"" des sogenannten Islamischen Staates zu helfen.

""Sie sind sehr gut darin, Personen zu finden, die sich in einer schwierigen Lebenssituation befinden. Menschen, die auf einer Sinnsuche sind, die in schwierigen Verhältnissen leben oder einfach nicht wissen, wohin ihr Weg sie führt"", sagt Oliver.

""Ich traf viele Menschen in Syrien und im Irak, die an solchen Wendepunkten ihres Lebens in die radikalislamistische Ideologie abgerutscht sind. Leute, die den falschen Brüdern vertraut haben.""

Oliver selbst ist in schwierigen Verhältnissen aufgewachsen, lebte viele Jahre in Heimen und betreuten Wohngruppen. Obwohl er lange Schwierigkeiten in der Schule hatte, schaffte er einen guten Schulabschluss und bekam eine begehrte Lehrstelle bei einer Versicherung.

Es wäre so wichtig, über diese Prozesse zu reden

Genau in diesem Moment, als sein Leben in halbwegs geordnete Bahnen zu gehen schien, kam er mit dem radikalen Islamismus in Kontakt.

Mit Leuten, die sich aus Versatzstücken der islamischen Religion eine politische Weltanschauung gezimmert haben. Die sich auf dem Islam berufen und ihr Selbstwertgefühl daraus ziehen, dass sie sich für die einzig wahren Gläubigen halten.

Es wäre so wichtig, über diese Prozesse endlich einmal zu reden: Wie geraten junge Menschen in die Fänge von radikalen Islamisten? Was lässt sie immer tiefer in den Strudel der Realitätsentfremdung geraten?

Leute wie Albrecht Glaser werden uns darauf keine Antworten geben können, weil es ihnen einzig darum geht, ganze Bevölkerungsgruppen pauschal zu verunglimpfen.

""Religion ist das wichtigste Mittel, um radikale Ideologen zu bekämpfen“

Oliver wurde in Syrien bei einem Raketenangriff schwer verwundet. Es gelang ihm auf abenteuerlichen Wegen, in die Türkei auszureisen.

In Wien wurde ihm der Prozess gemacht, er saß 20 Monate im Gefängnis und engagiert sich heute für einen Verein, der jungen Muslimen im Prozess der Deradikalisierung zur Seite steht.

""Eine österreichische Journalistin hat einmal gesagt, dass der Islam nicht die Lösung im Kampf gegen den Terror sei. Ich glaube, das Gegenteil ist richtig. Religion ist das wichtigste Mittel, um radikale Ideologen zu bekämpfen"", sagt Oliver.

""Wir müssen die Lügen der Extremisten richtigstellen, wo immer sie uns begegnen. Und wir werden das nur schaffen, wenn wir dabei mit den islamischen Gemeinden zusammenarbeiten. Imame müssen besser geschult werden. Auch innerhalb der Gemeinden muss ein stärkeres Bewusstsein dafür geschaffen werden, wo Radikalisierung anfängt. Es ist nicht normal, wenn junge Männer anfangen, ihre Freundeslisten bei Facebook von weiblichen Kontakten zu säubern. Das weiß ich aus eigener Erfahrung.""

Oliver ist übrigens immer noch Muslim. Er glaubt an eine Religion der Toleranz, Hilfsbereitschaft und des Friedens. So wie der allergrößte Teil der Muslime auf dieser Welt auch. Sie sollten im Kampf gegen den Terrorismus unsere wichtigsten Verbündeten werden.

Il avait été avec Georges Sarre, Pierre Guidoni et moi-même l'un des fondateurs du Cérès au mitan des années 1960"", a déclaré Jean-Pierre Chevènement, saluant ""son intelligence supérieure, sa vaste culture et son caractère"", qui le plaçaient ""très au-dessus de la grisaille de la petite politique"".

Didier Motchane était une figure exceptionnelle, un homme magnifique. Sa mort me bouleverse profondément https://t.co/45bTBwZ0da — J-P. Chevènement (@chevenement) October 29, 2017

""Depuis plus de cinquante ans, il a été, à mes côtés, une conscience exigeante et fidèle (...) Toute sa vie, Didier Motchane a été un bloc de courage, un homme magnifique et une grande âme, qui a affronté la mort comme il avait mené sa vie, sans ciller"", a encore souligné Chevènement.

Eurosceptique

""Les socialistes ont perdu l'un des leurs qui, jusqu'en 1993, contribua par l'exigence de sa pensée à la construction du PS"", a par ailleurs rendu hommage dans un communiqué le Parti socialiste. ""La rigueur doctrinale"" du Cérès ""a formé des milliers de cadres à une époque où l'idéologie comptait davantage que la petite phrase, où la recherche du sens primait sur celle du 'buzz'"", ajoute le PS.

""Les chemins"", rappelle le PS, ""s'étaient séparés au moment de la Première guerre du Golfe et, plus généralement, sur la question européenne"" mais ""cette rupture n'efface pas la vingtaine d'années pendant lesquelles il fut un repère pour une génération d'hommes et de femmes de gauche qui sont toujours des cadres du PS"".

""Il avait formé tant d'entre nous ! Tristesse et respect"", a tweeté la sénatrice PS Marie-Noëlle Lienemann.

Telle pourrait s'intituler une fable dont malheureusement le tragique court au seul énoncé de ces deux mots magiques autant que dangereux: Quotient intellectuel. Mon ami Laurent Alexandre dans un livre recent (La guerre des intelligences, Fayard, 2017) fait l'apologie de ce fameux QI, indicateur phare aux yeux des tenants d'une surhumanité dont la baisse annoncée ou confirmée chez certaines catégories de populations signerait le glas des civilisations touchées et prédirait l'effacement des groupes humains abâtardis, gorgés à la bétise la plus crasse. Un QI bas engendrerait donc mécaniquement l'esclavage voire la disparition des uns sous la domination des autres dotés de cerveaux plus rapides et mieux structurés, qu'ils soient faits de chair ou numériques. Vision simpliste orchestrée par ceux qui fondent la spécificité de l'homme sur une infime part de ses capacités cognitives et émotionelles. Nouvelle dictature du chiffre et des statistiques à l'ère des algorithmes reposant sur des critères aussi discutables qu'incertains et trompeurs. Reflet d'une société paniquée qui, sous l'émergence de l'intelligence artificielle, court après le toujours plus quantitatif dans l'espoir vain d'atteindre la perfection en espérant échapper à la concurrence des petaflops. Triste fuite en avant qui méconnait les ressources immenses que nos esprits de pauvres Sapiens, patauds et lents, utilisent tous les jours pour créer, donner, partager, aimer et vivre.

Dans un tel contexte, la tentation d'une élimination des moins doués, des plus faibles et des plus vieux, toutes personnes inutiles puisque ne produisant pas ou plus d'intelligence nous menace. Marqués au fer rouge par un QI à soixante-dix, à cent, à cent trente ou plus, nous serions déjà les objets d'un classement aussi ignoble que scandaleux, méconnaissant cet être vivant qu'est l'homme dont l'originalité est justement d'accepter les différences, les incertitudes, les faiblesses, les manques et les tares.

L'histoire est malheureusement jalonnée par d'innombrables exactions, y compris dans nos pays démocratiques, sous couvert d'un eugénisme primaire au nom de la pureté de la race ou du rêve d'un homme supérieur. La repression des boiteux et des faibles d'esprit est à nouveau en marche soutendue par le mirage du concept absurde de l'homme parfait. Dans toute personne se trouvent des trésors autres que la vantardise d'un QI à 160! Mais qu'adviendra-t-il quand, au prix d' une sélection impitoyable, ne resteront que des hommes et des femmes au QI de 200 en moyenne? Rien de plus qu'aujourd'hui car, statistiquement, certains dépasseront un QI de 300, ne faisant que reporter le problème de l'inégalité intellectuelle à un niveau supérieur.

De par notre héritage génétique, notre environnement familial et éducatif, notre alimentation, notre vie socioprofessionnelle, nos fréquentations et nos addictions il y aura toujours des hommes et des femmes plus ou moins doués. Est-ce à dire qu'il faille augmenter nos capacités cognitives dans une course grotesque à la musculation cerébrale par peur de la domination des machines pensantes, cette intelligence artificielle dont on nous rebat les oreilles à longueur de media avec Alphago Zero et Watson. La surenchère d'un bodybuilding neuronal que l'on voudrait nous imposer pour ne pas décrocher est affligeante. Politique mégalomaniaque au nom d'une surhumanité uploadée, composée uniquement d'êtres vivants parfaits en tous points physiques comme intellectuels. L'horreur absolue, l'uniformité maximale au nom de qui, de quoi? Ce qu'un infirme cérébral, un handicapé sensoriel ou moteur, un vieillard épuisé peuvent nous transmettre d'un mot, d'un regard, d'un sourire ou d'une larme, cette indicible relation à l'autre qui s'exprime hors du champs du seul calcul n'aurait-elle donc aucun intérêt, aucune valeur? Faut-il ne rien comprendre à ce que nous sommes dans notre fragilité, nos erreurs, nos approximations comme dans nos intuitions fulgurantes pour dénigrer celles et ceux qui ne possèdent qu'une agilité intellectuelle brute limitée mais peuvent avoir un coeur énorme.

Attention, danger! La barbarie du QI est en route. Ce challenge abjecte offense le nom meme d'humanité qui recouvre des capacités insoupconnées de dépassement, de renoncement et de partage forgeant la dignité de la personne. Quelle intelligence artificielle la plus forte osera-t-elle se sacrifier pour un idéal, dire non aux injonctions d'un dictateur en agissant comme Antigone face à Créon ou comme le dissident chinois debout, seul face aux chars, place Tienanmen?

Les trépidations des promoteurs d'une augmentation de nos capacités cognitives sont la pire des réponses à l'avenir de la personne humaine, car une fois notre encéphale bardé de puces construites par je ne sais quel Prométhée codeur, nous serons de facto immanquablement transformés en objets du concepteur, totalement réduits à son bon vouloir ; comme nous deviendrons les jouets de hackers sans foi ni loi, capables de nous faire disparaitre intellectuellement si nous les gênons. Il est donc grand temps de réunir les parties de la planète issues de toutes les civilisations pour réfléchir à notre avenir commun de cyborgs afin d'évaluer les bénéfices et les risques de telles manipulations et de définir la limite à ne pas franchir . Une COP digitale s'impose dès que possible dont la France devrait être l'initiatrice.

La dignité humaine n'est pas un vain mot d'éthiciens ringards. Elle exprime ce qui nous différencie fondamentalement des autres êtres vivants sachant que le jour ou nous cesserons de tendre la main à l'infirme amoindri, au débile mental, au vieux tremblant nous perdrons notre propre humanité. Aurait-il fallu supprimer Beethoven le sourd, Toulouse Lautrec le nabot bossu, Musset l'alcoolique, Rimbaud le camé et tant d'autres dont les oeuvres résonnent au plus profond de nous-mêmes? Un monde de perfection en nous rendant tous égaux puisque sans plus de défauts, générerait l'ennui absolu d'un normalisation sans aspérités ni variations en même temps qu'il sonnerait le glas de ce qui nous fait vivre dans l'intensité de nos êtres, dans la densité de nos personnes : Cette relation à l'autre, aux autres, à tous les autres dans leurs différences. Ce monde-là est inacceptable.

Am Montag haben sich die Ereignisse in der Russland-Affäre des Weißen Hauses überschlagen

Die 5 wichtigsten Enthüllungen im Überblick

Es war still geworden. Über Wochen hatte sich in der Russland-Affäre des Weißen Haus wenig getan.

Dann überschlugen sich am Montag die Meldungen. Bereits am Wochenende hatte sich angekündigt, dass die ersten Anklagen für ehemalige und derzeitige Wahlkampf-Helfer von US-Präsident Donald Trump an diesem Tag erfolgen würden.

► Darum geht es: Mitgliedern des Trump-Teams wird vorgeworfen, sich illegal mit Personen aus Russland während des Wahlkampfes abgesprochen zu haben, um die Wahl zu manipulieren.

► Im Zentrum der aktuellen Entwicklungen stehen drei Personen: Trumps ehemaliger Wahlkampfchef, der Unternehmer und Lobbyist Paul Manafort, dessen Geschäftspartner Rick Gates und der Ex-Berater George Papadopoulos.

Während das Weiße Haus betont, die aktuellen Vorwürfe würden sich auf die Zeit vor dem Wahlkampf beziehen - was für Manafort und Gates stimmt -, wächst der Druck auf Trump dennoch. Die Russland-Ermittlungen könnten zur Gefahr für den Präsidenten werden.

Hier ein Überblick über die Ereignisse am Montag:

1. Zwölf schwere Anklagepunkte gegen Manafort und Gates

Wichtig festzuhalten ist: Die Anklageschrift des Sonderermittlers Robert Mueller gegen Manafort und Gates hat nichts mit Donald Trump und einer möglichen Zusammenarbeit seines Wahlkampf-Teams mit Russland zu tun.

Dennoch: Die Vorwürfe gegen die beiden Geschäftsmänner sind ernst.

Ihnen wird vorgeworfen, zwischen 206 und 2015 heimlich für ausländische Regierungen gearbeitet zu haben. Manafort und Gates sollen Lobbyarbeit in den USA für die Kreml-nahe Regierung von Wiktor Janukowitsch, zwischen 2010 bis 2014 Präsident in der Ukraine, betrieben haben.

Lobbyarbeit für ausländische Regierungen muss in den USA registriert werden. Meiden Personen bewusst die Registrierung, ist das Betrug - und kann mit einer Haftstrafe geahndet werden.

Weiter wird Manafort und Gates vorgeworfen, die Bezahlung ihrer Lobbyarbeit über im Ausland tätige Banken vertuscht zu haben. Dabei soll es sich um eine Summe um über 75 Millionen Dollar handeln.

Die Anklage von Mueller zählt auch auf, wofür Manafort das Geld ausgab: ein Leben im Luxus. 934,350 Dollar soll Manafort etwa in einem Geschäft für kunstvolle Teppiche in Virgina ausgegeben haben.

Einer der zwölf Anklagepunkte lautet zudem: ""Verschwörung gegen die USA"". Das muss nicht bedeuten, dass sich Manafort mit einer ausländischen Regierung verschworen hat. Vielmehr bedeute dieser Punkt, dass Manaforts und Gates Vergehen über herkömmliche Verbrechen hinausgingen, die gegen die US-Regierung gerichtet sind, erklärt das US-Politikwebseite ""Vox"".

Die Anklageschrift hat zunächst also wenig mit Donald Trump persönlich zu tun - sie wirft dennoch ein äußerst zweifelhaftes Licht auf sein Wahlkampf-Team.

2. Die dubiosen Personen in Trumps Umfeld

Denn mit der veröffentlichten Anklageschrift vom Montag wird deutlich, mit welch zwielichtigen Personen sich der Wahlkämpfer Trump umgab. Die Anklagepunkte zeichnen von Manafort das Bild eines korrupten Geschäftsmanns, der seit vielen Jahren russische Interesse vertritt.

Hinzukommt, dass Manafort zwischen März bis August 2016 als Wahlkampfleiter eine zentrale Rolle in der Kampagne von Donald Trump einnahm.

Da stellt sich die Frage: Was wusste Trump über Manaforts Vergangenheit? Der US-Sender CNN stellt zwei Thesen auf - und beide lassen Trump nicht gut aussehen:

► Trump wusste von Manaforts dubiosen Geschäften - und es war ihm egal.

► Oder er wusste nichts von dessen Vergangenheit, die laut CNN ein offenes Geheimnis ein Washington gewesen sei - und gab ihm trotzdem einen zentralen Posten in seinem Wahlkampf-Team.

Als Mitte August 2016 bekannt wurde, dass Manafort 12,7 Millionen Dollar auf illegalem Weg von Janukowitsch erhalten hatte, trat er als Wahlkampfleiter zurück.

Gates war noch länger Teil von Trumps Umfeld und soll weiterhin auch das Weiße Haus besucht haben.

Beide, Manafort und Gates, plädierten am Montag auf nicht schuldig. Ein Gericht ordnete am Montag Hausarrest für Manafort an.

Ein anderer Wahlkämpfer von Trump bekannte sich stattdessen schuldig.

3. Berater Papadopoulos bekennt sich zu Falschaussage

Wahlkampfberater George Papadopoulos hatte gegenüber dem FBI zugegeben, eine Falschaussage gemacht zu haben. Das wurde ebenfalls am Montag bekannt.

Papadopoulos hatte beim FBI falsche Angaben über den Zeitpunkt seines Kontaktes mit einem ausländischen Professor gemacht.

Aus Papadopoulos Schuldbekenntnis geht hervor, dass der Professor den Berater erst kontaktierte, nachdem Papadopoulos Teil des Trump-Teams war. Der Professor versprach demnach, ""Schmutz"" aus Russland gegen Trumps Rivalin Hillary Clinton liefern zu können.

Das Team von Donald Trump betont, dass Papadopoulos nur eine kleine Beraterrolle innegehabt habe.

Dennoch zeigt die Enthüllung vom Monta: Teile des Trump-Teams versuchten, schädliche Informationen gegen Clinton zu sammeln. Auch Trumps Sohn Donald Trump Jr. traf sich mit einer russischen Anwältin, nachdem ihm solche Informationen versprochen worden waren.

Und so könnte die Enthüllung über Papadopoulus noch zu einem ""größeren Problem für Trump als Manaforts Anklage"" werden, kommentiert der US-Sender CNN.

4. Wird sich Manafort gegen Trump wenden?

Wie gefährlich sind die aktuellen Entwicklungen für Trump selbst? Zunächst dürften die Ereignisse vom Montag keine unmittelbaren Auswirkungen auf den US-Präsidenten haben.

Allerdings besteht die Möglichkeit, dass sich Manafort gegen Trump wendet - um Schaden von sich abzuwenden. Das vermutet etwa der US-Rechtsexperte und ehemalige Bundesstaatsanwalt Renato Mariotti.

This is consistent with an early indictment to get Manafort to flip. https://t.co/GkyIb53UZ7 — Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) 30. Oktober 2017

Auch über Papadopoulos vermuten US-Medien, dass er bereits mit Sonderermittler Mueller zusammenarbeitet.

5. Mueller stochert tief

Und so bleibt die Gefahr, dass Trump womöglich über die Russland-Affäre stolpert. Die 31-seitige Anklageschrift gegen Manafort zeigt, wie gründlich Sonderermittler Mueller in der Sache vorgeht.

Der ehemalige FBI-Direktor hat dutzende Dokumente aus dem Weißen Haus und auch Finanzdokumente von Trump selbst angefordert.

Auch enge Trump-Vertraute stehen im Verdacht, ihre Fühler nach Russland ausgestreckt zu haben. Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner und Sohn Donald Jr. gerieten in die Schlagzeilen, nachdem bekannt geworden war, dass sie sich im Wahlkampf mit einer russischen Anwältin getroffen hatten - in der Hoffnung, belastende Informationen über Clinton zu erhalten.

Dieser Montag bedeutet einen großen Fortschritt in der Ermittlung von Mueller - der Tag macht aber auch deutlich, dass die Untersuchung noch lange nicht zu Ende ist. Die Russland-Affäre dürfte Trumps Präsidentschafts weiter überschatten.

Gefährlich wird es für Trump, wenn er versucht, den Schatten des Ermittlers loszuwerden. Sollte der Präsident Sonderermittler Mueller entlassen, könnte das als Behinderung der Justiz gewertet werden - und womöglich in einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren vor dem US-Kongress enden.

In 2014, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry estimated that as many as 120,000 people were detained in North Korean political prison camps.
The U.N. accused North Korean authorities of committing crimes against humanity in political prison camps, including murder, enslavement, torture, rape and other forms of violence and persecution.
“We are especially concerned with the North Korean military, which operates as secret police, punishing all forms of dissent,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
“There is an undeniable nexus between North Korea’s human rights violations and the security threats it poses.”","Newly released satellite images offer a never-before-seen glimpse of North Korea’s “brutal and inhumane” network of political prisons, including secret labor camps.

In an accompanying report from the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK) published Thursday, David Hawk, former executive director of Amnesty International USA and a former U.N. human rights official, describes the harrowing conditions inside the regime’s “system of arbitrary detention and severe repression.”

Pyongyang denies the existence of its political penal labor camps, known as kwan-li-so, and says prisoners in its long-term “re-education” penitentiaries, termed kyo-hwa-so and run by a police force known as the Ministry of People’s Security, are treated with “warm love and consideration.”

In stark contrast to such unfounded claims, humanitarian workers and investigators like Hawk detail horrific treatment, including “grossly inadequate food rations” that leave prisoners “in a persistent state of hunger and malnutrition.”

Kyo-hwa-so inmates are forced to do intensive and often dangerous manual labor, including farming, logging and mining. Coal and other minerals mined with shovels are either used domestically or exported to China, the report notes.

“The brutal and arduous labor, grossly inadequate diet, and lack of medicine lead to a dreadfully large number of deaths in detention,” Hawk wrote.

Former prisoners told HRNK that the majority of North Korean inmates are detained for “crimes that are not really crimes.”

The North Korean Criminal Code allows severe punishment for acts including unauthorized gatherings, “hostile or superstitious activities,” and various forms of dissent, including anti-state propaganda and demonstrations.

In 2014, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry estimated that as many as 120,000 people were detained in North Korean political prison camps. An additional 70,000 were believed to be incarcerated at other detention facilities.

Suspected criminals are regularly held incommunicado and, during interrogation, “systematically degraded, intimidated and tortured, in an effort to subdue them and to extract a full confession,” according to the U.N. report. Many are also imprisoned without trial.

The U.N. accused North Korean authorities of committing crimes against humanity in political prison camps, including murder, enslavement, torture, rape and other forms of violence and persecution.

The United States sanctioned North Korea on Thursday for “flagrant abuses of human rights” by military and regime officials, including the use of forced labor.

“We are especially concerned with the North Korean military, which operates as secret police, punishing all forms of dissent,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month expanding economic sanctions against the country.

Michael Kirby, who chaired the U.N. commission report, said Hawk’s findings reveal an even greater degree of suffering than previously reported.

“Although these labor camps might be described as ‘ordinary prisons,’ there is nothing ‘ordinary’ in the treatment of those incarcerated there,” Kirby said, warning that “the grave danger [North Korea] presents derives from more than the weapons it has created.”

Pyongyang has been in the Western media spotlight in recent months as leader Kim Jong Un escalates threats of a nuclear attack against the U.S. But people tend to forget about the isolated nation’s humanitarian crisis, according to Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of HRNK.

“Even as the world is transfixed by the slings and arrows surrounding vital nuclear weapons considerations, it is more important than ever to ensure that the fate of everyday North Koreans trapped in the unyielding gulag systems remains at the forefront of our efforts and the efforts of the international community,” Scarlatoiu said. “There is an undeniable nexus between North Korea’s human rights violations and the security threats it poses.”",Aerial Images Reveal North Korea's Secret Network Of Prisons And 'Re-Education' Camps,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-prison-camp-aerial-images_us_59f2289ce4b03cd20b80484b

Gewalt auf der Straße, Wohnungseinbrüche, Angst vor Terror: Die innere Sicherheit treibt viele Bürger um. Bei den heutigen Sondierungsgesprächen von Union, FDP und Grünen wird es unter anderem darum gehen, gemeinsame Antworten auf diese Fragen zu finden.

Es dürfte eine schwierige Debatte werden, denn in ihren Wahlprogrammen vertreten die möglichen Koalitionspartner unterschiedliche Standpunkte zu den Themen.

Die Union spricht sich beispielsweise für mehr Überwachung aus und fordert mehr Befugnisse für Polizei, Geheimdienste und dergleichen. Grüne und FDP dagegen sind gegen eine großflächige Kameraüberwachung.

Die einzelnen Diskussionspunkte im Überblick:

► Polizei: Die Union verspricht 15.000 zusätzliche Polizisten in Bund und Ländern. Auch die Grünen fordern mehr Beamte. Die FDP verlangt ebenfalls deutlich mehr Geld für die Polizei. Um Polizisten zu entlasten, will die FDP auch prüfen, ob bestimmte Aufgaben nicht auch andere Behörden übernehmen können - etwa beim Objektschutz oder der Begleitung von Schwertransporten.

Die Union plädiert außerdem für ein “Musterpolizeigesetz” für alle Bundesländer, um bundeseinheitliche Standards zu erreichen.

► Justiz: Damit Straftaten am Ende auch vor Gericht landen, plädieren die Grünen dafür, auch bei Gerichten und Staatsanwaltschaften das Personal aufzustocken - allerdings ohne Zahlen zu nennen. Auch die FDP fordert eine “Haushaltspriorität” für die Justiz und mahnt, für die klassischen Hoheitsaufgaben des Staates müsse mehr Geld zur Verfügung stehen.

Grüne wollen Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz auflösen

► Geheimdienste: Die Union bekennt sich zu den deutschen Nachrichtendiensten. Die Grünen dagegen wollen das Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz in seiner jetzigen Form auflösen und grundlegend anders aufbauen.

Die FDP ist ebenfalls für Reformen beim Verfassungsschutz und will die Zahl der Sicherheitsbehörden insgesamt minimieren, um die Strukturen übersichtlicher zu machen.

► Videoüberwachung: Die Union will im öffentlichen Raum, zum Beispiel in Einkaufszentren, vor Fußballstadien und an Verkehrsknotenpunkten mehr Videokameras installieren, auch zur Fahndung. Grüne und FDP betonen, Videoüberwachung dürfe es nur in Maßen geben, aber auf keinen Fall flächendeckend.

► Datenzugriff für Sicherheitsbehörden: Die Union will den Sicherheitsbehörden mehr Zugriff auf vorhandene Datenbanken geben - zur Verhinderung und Aufklärung schwerer Straftaten. Die FDP wendet sich gegen jede anlasslose Datensammlung - wie etwa die Vorratsdatenspeicherung. Auch die Möglichkeiten zur Funkzellenabfrage will die FDP einschränken.

► Terrorabwehr: Die Union will das Gemeinsame Terrorismusabwehrzentrum von Bund und Ländern so weiterentwickeln, “dass dort gemeinsam über verbindliche Maßnahmen entschieden werden kann”. Bislang ist das Zentrum eher eine Plattform zum Informationsaustausch.

Die FDP tritt dafür ein, zur besseren Terrorbekämpfung Europol zu einer EU-Bundespolizei auszubauen und auch einen EU-Nachrichtendienst zu gründen.

It's Friday night. The city's finest restaurant is bathed in candlelight while a couple clinks to 10 years and sips on overpriced champagne. This evening was long awaited; the prospect of some adult conversation was worth the logistical gymnastics required to get the kids babysat.

One partner looks into the other's eyes, lingers lovingly over the pregnant pause and then launches the opening statement as planned: ""Honey, thanks for joining me for your annual performance review. I've been looking forward to examining how you've gone over the past 12 months"".

For the next two hours they dissect and label productivity in graphs and numbers. One partner went from a four to a five in delegation, but... then again... that bout of toast burning in the month of March knocked domesticity down to a three. All in all, however, the score was sufficient; the meeting productive; and the dessert delicious.

Sound sexy? We don't think so either. It lacks a certain... heart, don't you think? And yet, when we're honest about the way most organisations handle their people, it's really no different from this. It just lacks the decadent dessert at the end.

The reality is, most of us enjoy our annual performance reviews as much as we do a root canal. With the exception of those rare (and rather odd) eager beavers in any organisation, we usually don't look for opportunities to be pried open and dug into on the operating chair. It's awkward; ambiguous at times, and can be very painful.

Unsurprisingly, companies are starting to question the value of the annual performance review, exploring a more natural alternative for keeping fingers on company pulses.

As we've been examining their new normal, we're getting more convinced than ever -- that they're onto something. Here's why...

From annual to everyday.

The annual review has been called a rite of 'corporate kabuki' when it comes to offering honest, constructive and real-time input. Once a year the manager sits down to discuss the should've, could've, would'ves of your performance that year, but by the time six months prior is behind you, it's too late to learn and grow from it. The moment has already passed -- and rather than it being used as a real-time lesson to springboard change and innovation, it now feels like a lingering slap on the wrist.

It's a constant case of rear view mirror gazing, when we should in fact, be looking forward and focused on getting future ready.

The point is this: if our organisations are meant to be organic, shouldn't they be breathing? Since we're dealing with human beings, after all, shouldn't our systems operate along the natural rhythms of human relationships and interactions? Isn't this all really about connecting with colleagues and working together to deliver great outcomes for clients and our businesses?

Adobe came to this conclusion in 2012 when they switched to a more agile system that made honest feedback a regular part of the workday. Managers and employees now start the year by co-setting mutual goals and articulating expectations. From there, assessments are real time and ongoing. Constructive criticism or recognition is shared immediately, so that both parties can respond and adapt to what's needed, and at the end of the quarter, workers receive an overall recap of strengths and opportunities for development. It's far more intuitive, in the moment, and it's proving very effective.

From numbers to conversations.

What could be dealt with quickly over a cup of coffee has become an ode to endless paperwork and obscure evaluation criteria. And needless to say, the idea of people -- complex and emotionally unique beings -- being reduced to a number, doesn't exactly fare well.

""If you're trying to motivate people, assigning them ratings (especially when forced on a bell curve) isn't a great idea,"" says HR Consultant, Mary Jenkins, in her coauthored book 'Abolishing Performance Appraisals'.

""Studies have shown over and over again that people simply think they perform better than other people. Unless you rate someone in the highest category, the conversation shifts away from feedback and development to justification.""

It invariably becomes a martial arts-like exercise of self-defence and justification.

That's why Juniper did away with the labelling and rating system and embraced a more human-centred approach among their people. 'Conversation Day' is part of the new normal, where employees and their managers discuss the contributions and aspirations of employees for the future -- where the concept of passing or failing is irrelevant, and the focus is on possibility rather than pointing out problems.

Steven Rice, Juniper's Executive Vice President for Human Resources says, ""There's no label associated with any individual, so from our perspective, there is no formal or traditional performance management process in the company"".

Juniper made the brave, but somewhat 'messier' decision to respect and engage people, rather than number them.

From measuring to motivating.

Research firm CEB found that the average manager spends more than 200 hours a year wading through performance review paperwork. Those hours, along with the costly technology required (and not to mention the wine it takes to get through!), add up to roughly $35 million a year that a company of about 10,000 employees will spend on annual performance reviews. This is just mind boggling.

Imagine if future managers were utterly passionate about the people they work with, where the why would be just as important as the who and what at work. If leaders were to adopt this kind of inclusive, human-centred approach across the board, taking the time to lean in and really understand their people, articles like these wouldn't need to be written.

It would be dead obvious: annual reviews would become redundant, and meaningful and purpose driven conversations would be the new order of the day. Sounds brilliant.

But wherever you stand on the issue, it's good to ask if what you're doing now is actually working. Chances are, if your systems are essentially saying, see you in 11 months, you could be doing it much better. After all, keeping your finger on the company pulse means you keep it there every day.",How To Stop Performance Reviews From Being So Painful,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/jeanette-sanderson/how-to-stop-performance-reviews-from-being-so-painful_a_23254812/

BBC Claire acknowledged Adam's actions on the show

With many people on Twitter discussing whether Adam’s actions crossed a line, Claire’s representative told MailOnline: “We don’t believe anything was intended by Adam’s gesture and it has caused no offence to Claire.” When contacted by HuffPost UK, Adam’s publicist said: “This is so blown out of proportion. Adam did it as a friendly gesture just like here in the Jimmy Fallon clip with Dustin Hoffman.” It wasn’t just fans on Twitter who appeared to notice Adam’s actions, as Emma Thompson - who was on Adam’s left during the show - also seemed to glare at the actor.

“This is about awareness … this is not a new thing,” Goldwyn said. “It’s something that we all need to take responsibility for.

It happened to me by a man and it wasn’t as extended and awful as what Lupita went through, but it was the same thing,” he said. “It was the casting couch, and I didn’t understand quite what was going on.

Klaus wendet bei ihr den sogenannten Tennislehrer-Trick an

Als die beiden in der Küche sind, wird es heiß

Bauer Klaus sprüht in der aktuellen Folge ""Bauer sucht Frau"" nur so vor Testosteron, denn die thailändische Kandidatin Tiwaporn hat es ihm angetan. So heißt sie übrigens wirklich. Eigentlich ganz leicht zu merken: Nicht Youporn, sondern Tiwaporn.

Tiwaporn scheint sich ebenfalls zu Klaus hingezogen zu fühlen. Das liegt allerdings auch an den Tricks, die der listige Bauer anwendet. Als die beiden den Stall ausmisten, erklärt Klaus seiner Tiwaporn noch einmal ganz genau, wie das mit der Mistgabel funktioniert. Dazu stellt er sich natürlich hinter Tiwaporn und hilft ihr von hinten beim Führen der Mistgabel. Das ist schließlich gar nicht so einfach.

""Ich habe bei Tiwaporn den Tennislehrer-Trick angewendet"", erklärt er den RTL-Reportern. Tatsächlich ist der Trick Tennis-Spielerinnen nur allzu bekannt. Denn der ein oder andere Lehrer stellt auf ähnliche Weise gerne mal seine Lehrer-Qualitäten unter Beweis - vor allem in klischeehaften Filmen. Oder eben bei ""Bauer sucht Frau"".

Klaus: ""Wie Händchen halten, nur mit Mistgabel""

""Auf diese Weise komme ich Tiwaporn näher"", erklärt Klaus sein ausgefuchstes Vorgehen. ""Das ist wie Händchen halten, nur eben mit einer Mistgabel.""

Und es funktioniert. Tiwaporn ist ganz hingerissen vom intimen Stall-Ausmisten. Als die beiden schließlich in die Küche gehen, wird es richtig heiß. Denn sie gehen Klaus' liebstem Hobby nach: Bauernbrot backen.

Bewundernd sieht Tiwaporn zu, wie leidenschaftlich der Bauer seinen Teig knetet. ""Schneller!"", befiehlt sie. Klaus gehorcht zunächst - doch dann greift er zu einem weiteren gewieften Trick: Er beginnt, Tiwaporn zu bestäuben. Das ist natürlich wörtlich gemeint.

Der flirtbegabte Bauer greift sich eine Hand voll Mehl und stäubt die Thailänderin ein. Sie kichert und die Bestäubung nimmt ihren Lauf.

Und auch das Bauernbrot ist ein voller Erfolg: Sehr knackig und sehr braun (also gut, ein bisschen verbrannt) kommt es aus dem Ofen. Jetzt fehlen eigentlich nur noch die Kinder. Bis dahin müssen die beiden das ganze Bauernbrot allein vernaschen.

Liebe Frau Merkel,

jetzt regieren Sie also wohl weiter, und das auch noch mit einer starken AfD und FDP im Bundestag. Schlimmer hätte es für uns Alleinerziehende kaum kommen können.

Dass Sie an der Macht bleiben werden, ist nicht überraschend. Und trotzdem tue ich mich schwer, mich damit abzufinden. Denn vier weitere Jahre CDU an der Regierung bedeuten, eine Frau als Kanzlerin hin oder her, dass wir Alleinerziehenden weiterhin als Randgruppe bedauerlicher Einzelfälle angesehen werden.

Wobei das mit dem Bedauern auf wackeligen Füßen steht: Den Quatsch mit dem selbstverschuldeten Lebensmodell, den die AfD verzapft, gehen Sie zwar so offen nicht mit. Bei der CDU herrscht Barmherzigkeit, wir können uns etwas Mitleid abholen - und dann sollen wir Alleinerziehenden aber gefälligst auch ruhig sein.

Wir wuppen das, was in Familien zwei Erwachsene tun, ganz alleine

Aber wenn ich genau hingucke, dann ist das Bild, das die AfD von Alleinerziehenden zeichnet, gar nicht so weit entfernt von dem, das ich bei Ihnen in der Partei finde.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 15 Dinge, die eine Alleinerziehende dir sagen will

Denn für die tiefgläubigen Katholiken, und mit denen ist die CDU ja schon vom Parteinamen her im Pakt, ist eine Alleinerziehende eine Frau, die mit einem Bein in der Hölle steht. Schon die Scheidung ist verpönt, die Ehe ein Sakrileg – und folgerichtig stellen Sie und Ihre Partei die Ehe über alles, sogar über Kinder.

Sie sehen uns nicht – und wenn, dann als gescheiterte Existenzen, als Mütter zweiter Klasse, die mit durchgefüttert werden, weil es der christliche Gedanke gebietet. Aber Sympathien, oder gar Hochachtung für uns, das haben Sie nicht.

Dabei sind wir die heimlichen Leistungsträgerinnen in diesem Land! Ja, das meine ich ganz ernst. Wir wuppen das, was in Familien zwei Erwachsene tun, ganz alleine, oft noch unter Anfeindungen von missgünstigen Mitmenschen, die nur darauf warten, dass bei uns irgendwas schiefgeht, und sei es nur der vergessene Kuchen zum Klassenfest.

Wir sind Mütter mit Makeln

""Die ist alleinerziehend, die packt das nicht!“, tuscheln die Leute dann oder schauen einfach tadelnd. Oder sie schicken uns gleich das Jugendamt auf den Hals, weil die Kinder schon wieder krank sind oder Mama nach der Arbeit erst um 17 Uhr nach Hause kommt, und das Grundschulkind seit dem Mittagessen alleine Zuhause ist.

All dies ist Alltag für alleinerziehende Mütter. ""Wenn euch Alleinerziehenden nicht die Männer weglaufen würden, dann müsste ich jetzt nicht die Gewerbesteuer erhöhen, um Kitaplätze zu schaffen"", sagte allen Ernstes ein CDU-Bürgermeister zu einer Leserin von mir.

Er sagte es nicht öffentlich, so wie derjenige ältere Herr aus der CDU, der mir deutlich zu verstehen gab, dass ich als Alleinerziehende per se versagt habe, weil die Ehe um jeden Preis zu erhalten sei, und ich als Frau, die ihren Mann verließ, gesündigt hätte.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Die etablierte Politik vernachlässigt Familien und Alleinerziehende - und die AfD nutzt das gezielt für sich aus

Hätte er mich verlassen, dann hätte ich übrigens auch versagt, weil ich ihn nicht halten konnte. Alleinerziehende können eigentlich gar nichts richtig machen, wir sind Mütter mit Makeln. Ausgestoßene gewissermaßen, von der Teilhabe ausgeschlossen, auch wegen der Armut, unter der viele von uns trotz Arbeit und guter Bildung leiden.

""Ja, aber wir tun doch auch was für Alleinerziehende! Wir planen den Rechtsanspruch auf einen Hortplatz!"", mögen Sie sagen. Schon – aber das machen Sie, liebe Frau Merkel, für die Wirtschaft. Nicht für die Eltern, und schon gar nicht für Alleinerziehende.

Die meisten sind froh, wenn sie am Ende des Monats noch Geld für Essen haben

Denn im Grunde finden Sie ja, dass alles gut so ist, wie es ist, das ist das Kernstück von wahrem Konservativismus. Das Ehegattensplitting muss bleiben, sagen Sie, das mit der Altersarmut werde schon nicht so schlimm, eine Frauenquote brauche man nicht, und hey, Sie wollen sogar ein Kinderbaugeld zahlen.

Da muss ich allerdings ziemlich bitter lachen – als ob Alleinerziehende das Geld für Wohneigentum hätten. Die meisten sind froh, wenn sie überhaupt am Ende des Monats noch Geld für Essen haben. Aber daran sieht man ja ganz klar, welches Familienbild die Union propagiert: keins, in dem eine Mutter oder ein Vater mit den Kindern alleine lebt.

Dann schon lieber ein homosexuelles Paar mit Kindern. Damit haben sich ja zumindest Teile Ihrer Partei angefreundet. Am besten, ich rate meinen Kindern, schwul oder lesbisch zu werden. Alleinerziehend jedenfalls sollten sie unter Ihrer Regierung nicht sein.

The first phase of the surgery was done on August 28, which included experts from Japan as well. As part of the first phase, a new bypass technique was used for the first time on the twins.

Ahead of the surgery, the twins had to undergo numerous tests. While conjoined twins are known to occur in about every 2,00,000 births, craniopagus twins are rarer, accounting for about only two per cent.

The Odisha government has sanctioned Rs 1 crore for the surgery at AIIMS.

Earlier, the twins had undergone medical check up at at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack.

A.K. Mahapatra, chief of neurosciences centre, earlier said the twins suffer from a condition that afflicts one in 30 lakh children, of which 50 per cent die either at birth or within 24 hours.

Surgery is feasible only on 25 per cent of the survivors while the rest continue to live with the condition.",Odisha Twins Joined At The Head Separated After Marathon Surgery In AIIMS,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/26/odisha-twins-joined-at-the-head-separated-after-marathon-surgery-in-aiims_a_23257709/

The screens have been pulled into an intense public debate in recent weeks amid allegations of conflict of interest that have stalked Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

Morneau set up one of the screens after entering office in 2015 on a recommendation from the federal ethics commissioner, who told him a blind trust wouldn't be necessary since his shares in his family's firm were indirectly held through private companies. Therefore, she said, they were not considered a controlled asset under the Conflict of Interest Act.

NDP blasts Morneau charity pledge:

Political opponents have attacked Morneau for choosing a screen rather than a blind trust. For his part, Morneau has maintained that has not been in a conflict of interest.

A few of Morneau's cabinet colleagues also have screens, however, for different reasons.

Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi are using conflict-of-interest screens to prevent them from participating in matters or decisions related to company holdings involving their spouses.

Fisheries Minister Dominic LeBlanc also has a screen to ensure he abstains from participating in decisions related to J.D. Irving Ltd. because of his close friendship with the Irving family.

'It's working very well'

LeBlanc said Monday that ethics commissioner Mary Dawson recommended he set up an ethics screen for any cabinet or privy council documents that have anything to do with J.D. Irving Ltd., or its affiliates and subsidiaries.

""Under the rules, you shouldn't be using ... your public office to benefit a friend,"" LeBlanc said. ""From my perspective it's working very well.""

LeBlanc's screen, in place since early 2016, means he wouldn't have been privy to cabinet information about shipbuilding contracts or even the Energy East pipeline, both of which have connections to Irving.

Sohi said Monday that he has a screen in place to prevent him from participating in decisions that could benefit his wife's holdings in a company that's also a partial owner of farmland in Alberta.

He argues the screen, which is overseen by his chief of staff, has already proven to be an effective tool.

Sohi said because of the screen he's been him removed from the approval process for an infrastructure project that was proposed by the province. It would be in close proximity to the farmland.

Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould waits to appear before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights on Parliament Hill on Oct. 18, 2017.

""My chief of staff has made sure that I do not participate in any shape or form in the approval of that particular project,"" Sohi said.

""It will be done by a different minister and it would have to go the Treasury Board to make sure there's no conflict whatsoever.""

Wilson-Raybould's profile on the ethics commissioner's website states that she must abstain from decisions or matters related to self-government talks with First Nations and Indigenous communities with the consulting company, KaLoNa Group, in which she holds a significant interest. Her spouse is also the president and controlling interest holder of the firm.

The added public scrutiny on the conflict-of-interest issue has been driven by allegations related to pension legislation Morneau introduced in the House of Commons.

Opponents allege the pension reform could benefit Morneau Shepell, a human resources and pension management firm he helped build with his father before entering office. Morneau maintains he was never in a conflict of interest.

Ethics watchdog pushed Tories to change rules

In response to accusations that he's personally profited from decisions he's taken as finance minister, Morneau has promised to sell off $21 million worth of shares in his family's company and place the rest his substantial assets in a blind trust.

Morneau has also promised to donate to charity any gains in the value of his Morneau Shepell shares since he was elected two years ago. The gains are estimated to be worth more than $5 million.

Dawson recommended the screen for Morneau to prevent any appearance of a conflict of interest and maintain the public's confidence.

Her office also confirmed Monday that up to four cabinet ministers currently hold controlled assets indirectly, but would not share the names nor provide a more-precise number.

The issue of indirect holdings in a company have been at the centre of the debate around Morneau.

Dawson urged the previous Conservative government in 2013 to amend the law to require blind trusts for personal assets owned by ministers, regardless of whether they were directly or indirectly owned — a change that was never made.",3 Other Liberal Ministers Used Same Conflict-Of-Interest Screen As Bill Morneau,http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/30/3-other-liberal-ministers-used-same-conflict-of-interest-screen-as-bill-morneau_a_23261127/

Sie widersprechen darin der These, die Flüchtlingspolitik von Merkel sei schuld am schlechten Wahlergebnis der CDU

Auch Wochen nach der Bundestagswahl ist sich die CDU nicht einig, welchen Kurs die Partei künftig verfolgen will. Drei CDU-Abgeordnete wehren sich nun mit einem vierseitigen Dokument gegen einen Rechtsruck, berichtet die ""Welt"" am Montag.

Seit dem Wochenende zirkuliere das Papier in der Partei. Es trage den Titel ""Jenseits von konservativ und populistisch"", berichtet die ""Welt"", der das Dokument vorliegt.

Verfasser sind demnach die CDU-Bundestagsabgeordneten Andreas Nick, Marcus Weinberg und Matthias Zimmer.

""Panik ersetzt keine Politik""

Die drei Abgeordneten widersprechen in dem Papier vor allem einer These, die nach dem Wahldebakel der Union bei der Bundestagswahl oft zu hören war: Die Flüchtlingspolitik von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) sei schuld am schlechten Abschneiden bei der Wahl gewesen.

Vielmehr hätten die innerparteilichen Querelen seit 2015 Wähler verschreckt, laute das Argument der Autoren.

Eine Lehre aus den vergangenen Landtagswahlen sei: Wo die CDU rhetorisch die Mitte verlassen habe, sei es zu ""besonders empfindliche Niederlagen"" gekommen, zitiert die ""Welt"" aus dem Papier. ""Die Wählerinnen und Wähler haben weder die demonstrative Abwendung von der Politik der Bundesregierung noch die markigen Sprüche der Ausgrenzung belohnt.""

Nick, Weinberg und Zimmer halten es auch für falsch, die ""rechte Flanke"" nun zu schließen, um AfD-Wähler zurückzugewinnen, wie einige CDU- und CSU-Politiker nach der Wahl gefordert hatten.

""Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass der Wahlerfolg der AfD dort am größten war, wo die CDU selbst den Eindruck erweckt hat, die AfD habe mit ihrer Kritik an der Bundesregierung und ihren Forderungen in der Flüchtlingspolitik irgendwie recht"", heiße es in dem Papier.

Die Autoren würden nicht explizit den CDU-Landesverband in Sachsen nennen, kommentiert die ""Welt"". Dennoch sei der Bezug deutlich: ""Wer vom Weg der Tugend abkommt und damit seine Haltung verliert, der kann in Gefahr geraten. Panik ersetzt keine Politik.""

Rechtsruck in Sachsen

In Sachsen lagen nach der Wahlschlappe die Nerven blank. Die AfD war stärkste Kraft vor der CDU in dem Bundesland geworden.

Ministerpräsident Stanislaw Tillich trat zurück, dessen Wunschnachfolger Michael Kretschmer bezeichnete bei einem Treffen in Dresden vergangene Woche die CDU als ""Original der AfD"". Die Partei müsse den Rechtspopulisten die Positionen ""wieder wegnehmen, die Unionspositionen sind"".

Bei dem Treffen von 200 Mandats- und Funktionsträgern der Sachsen-CDU war der Tenor deutlich: Die CDU müsse weiter nach rechts rücken. Auch der Rücktritt von CDU-Bundesvorsitzenden Angela Merkel wurde gefordert.

Der Rechtsruck stößt aber auch in Sachsen nicht nur auf Zuspruch. Die ehemalige Dresdner CDU-Politikerin Elisabeth Galli erklärte zuletzt in der HuffPost ihren Parteiaustritt. Über den neuen Kurs sagte sie: ""Wenn man das will, verabschiedet man sich als Partei von seinen Werten.""

Unterstützung aus der Fraktion

Die Autoren des Papiers ""Jenseits von konservativ und populistisch"" sehen das ähnlich. Sie seien Teil einer Gruppe von Bundestagsabgeordneten und einflussreichen Bezirksvorsitzenden, die den konservativen Politikern in der Union widersprechen wollen, berichtet die ""Welt"" weiter.

Von mehreren CDU-Politikern erhalten Nick, Weinberg und Zimmer Rückdeckung. Die stellvertretende Fraktionsvorsitzende Sabine Weiss, lobt die Autoren.

""Eine ganz große Mehrheit in der Bundestagsfraktion sieht das genauso. Wir können das ständige Gerede einiger Weniger, die CDU sei nach links gerutscht, einfach nicht mehr hören"", sagte Weiss der ""Welt"".

Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, Sprecherin der Arbeitsgruppe Recht der Fraktion, befürwortet die Position der Autoren gegenüber der ""Welt"": ""Wir tun uns keinen Gefallen, wenn wir nach rechts rücken.""

CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne haben sich bei Bildung und Digitalisierung auf höhere Investitionen einigen können

Nach dem Streit in der vergangenen Woche haben die ""Jamaikaner"" zur konstruktiven Arbeit zurückgefunden - und können am Montagabend Ergebnisse vorlegen.

Die Einigung: CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne wollen in einer möglichen Jamaika-Koalition die Ausgaben für Bildung und Forschung deutlich steigern und die digitale Infrastruktur ausbauen.

Zum bisherigen Kooperationsverbot zwischen Bund und Ländern in der Bildung heißt es in einem am Montag in Berlin veröffentlichten Papier der Jamaika-Unterhändler lediglich: ""Über die Art und Weise der Zusammenarbeit zwischen Bund, Ländern und Kommunen muss noch gesprochen werden, insbesondere über die Frage des Kooperationsverbotes.""

So viel Geld wollen die Parteien ausgeben

Bis zum Jahr 2025 sollten für Bildung und Forschung mehr als zehn Prozent des Bruttoinlandsproduktes (BIP) aufgewendet werden, heißt es in dem Papier.

Zudem wollen die Parteien die Ausbildungsförderung Bafög modernisieren und mehr Studenten einen Anspruch eröffnen. Die Aufwendungen für Forschung und Entwicklung, die Nahtstelle zwischen Hochschulen und Wirtschaft, sollen auf 3,5 Prozent des BIP erhöht werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Eine Grafik verrät, wie ungerecht die deutsche Bildungspolitik ist – doch niemand darf sie sehen

Für die Digitalisierung sei der Breitbandausbau wesentlich. Welche Technologie dazu genutzt werde - etwa Glasfaser - sei noch zu erörtern, machte CDU-Generalsekretär Peter Tauber deutlich.

Zudem sollen möglichst schnell Funklöcher auf dem Land geschlossen werden. Wo dieses Themenfeld angesiedelt werden soll - als selbstständiges Ministerium, bei Bildung und Forschung oder bei der Wirtschaft - sei offen, sagte Tauber.

""Jamaika könnte das Bündnis der digitalen Chancen sein""

Bei der Digitalisierung gehe es auch um den Ausbau der Datensicherheit, sagte FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer. Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner sagte: ""Jamaika könnte ... könnte das Bündnis der digitalen Chancen sein.""

Wie Beer hob er hervor, dass sich die Unterhändler klar zu einem modernen Datenrecht bekannt hätten - unter Wahrung der Bürgerrechte. Der auslaufende Hochschulpakt zwischen Bund und Ländern zur Bewältigung der hohen Studierendenzahlen solle verlängert werden.

Alle vier hoben hervor, dass sich die Arbeitsatmosphäre wesentlich verbessert habe. Kellner sagte, der Pulverdampf der vergangenen Woche sei wohl mit dem Wind vom Wochenende verflogen. Er sprach von einer ""sehr guten Arbeitsatmosphäre"".

Auch bei weiteren Themenblöcken bestehen Einigungen

Auch bei der Pflege haben sich die Parteien geeinigt: der Pflegebereich soll gestärkt werden. Dazu seien mehr Personal und bessere Ausstattung notwendig, sagte Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner am Montag in Berlin. Darüber hinaus seien für die Grünen die Beitragsparität bei den Beiträgen für die gesetzliche Krankenversicherung wichtig.

Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Bund und Ländern im Kampf gegen Terrorismus wollen Union, FDP und Grüne verbessern. Dabei solle die Koordinierungsfunktion von Bundeskriminalamt und Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV) stärker als bisher wahrgenommen werden, heißt es in einem Leitlinien-Papier zum Bereich Innen, Sicherheit und Rechtsstaat.

Der Einsatz von Videoüberwachung solle an Kriminalitätsschwerpunkten, an besonders gefährlichen Orten, Einrichtungen und bei Veranstaltungen gegebenenfalls auch befristet angeordnet werden können, heißt es weiter. Zudem sei die Cybersicherheit für die Zukunft Deutschlands von herausragender Bedeutung.

""Es ist in einer Nacht nicht leichter geworden""

Nach dem Geheimtreffen der Parteichefs vom Sonntagabend waren die Jamaika-Unterhändler in der Tat bemüht, die aufgeheizte Stimmung abzukühlen.

CSU-Parteichef Horst Seehofer sagte vor Beginn der Sondierungen am Montag, die Runde der Vorsitzenden habe der Atmosphäre gut getan. ""Aber es ist jetzt nicht in einer Nacht leichter geworden. Einfach von der Sache her.""

Neben Bildung und Digitales standen auch die Themenbereiche Arbeit, Rente sowie Inneres und Recht auf dem Programm. Am Nachmittag kam der mehr als 50 Mitglieder große Kreis der Unterhändler zusammen, um eine Zwischenbilanz zu ziehen.

Bereits am Donnerstag wollen sie sich erneut an die Themen Migration und Klimaschutz machen, die in der vergangenen Woche zu massivem Streit geführt hatten und vertagt worden waren.

In der Zuwanderungspolitik ist der Familiennachzug für Flüchtlinge einer der Knackpunkte. Beim Klimaschutz gab es vergangene Woche Krach darüber, wie die nationalen und internationalen Ziele zur Treibhausgas-Minderung erreicht werden sollen.

Despite action being taken by countries across the globe, the report states that these unprecedented levels will lead to huge changes in climate systems causing “severe ecological and economic disruptions.” The report uses data collected by research stations in over 50 countries around the globe including Antarctica. These findings are designed to be an early warning system for the planet allowing us to potentially avert irreversible changes in the climate. Despite this CO2 levels have continued to rise thanks to increase agriculture, population growth and the continued burning of fossil fuels on a massive scale. “Without rapid cuts in CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, we will be heading for dangerous temperature increases by the end of this century, well above the target set by the Paris climate change agreement,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “Future generations will inherit a much more inhospitable planet, “ he said.

The problem with CO2 is that there is no quick solution to the problem, it remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and even longer in the oceans. What that means is that even if we start trying to fix the problem now the simple fact is we’re still going to have to deal with the consequences of our actions. “There is currently no magic wand to remove this CO 2 from the atmosphere,”said Mr Taalas. According to the report, the last time the Earth experienced these levels of CO2 was some 3.5 million years ago.

Nach seiner Absetzung und einer Anklage wegen Rebellion ist der katalanische Regionalpräsident Carles Puigdemont nach Belgien gereist. Der Anführer der Unabhängigkeitsbewegung habe dort am Montag mit einem Anwalt gesprochen, berichtete die belgische Nachrichtenagentur Belga am Abend unter Berufung auf den Juristen.

Unklar blieb zunächst, ob der Katalane in Belgien Asyl beantragen will.

Der Chefkoordinator der Volkspartei (PP) des spanischen Ministerpräsidenten Mariano Rajoy, Fernando Martínez Maíllo, kommentierte die Medienberichte mit den Worten: ""Ja, das ist anscheinend bestätigt."" Die Flucht zeuge ""von Verzweiflung"", sagte er am Montag vor Journalisten in Madrid.

Anklage wegen Rebellion

Die spanische Staatsanwaltschaft hatte am Montag Anklage gegen Puigdemont und weitere Angehörige der abgesetzten Regionalregierung erhoben. Die Vorwürfe gegen die Angeklagten lauteten unter anderem auf Rebellion, Auflehnung gegen die Staatsgewalt und Unterschlagung öffentlicher Gelder, sagte Generalstaatsanwalt José Manuel Maza am Montag in Madrid.

Am Wochenende hatte Belgiens Staatssekretär für Asyl und Migration, Theo Francken, für Empörung gesorgt, weil er sein Land als möglichen Zufluchtsort für die abgesetzten Politiker ins Spiel brachte. Katalanen, die sich politisch verfolgt fühlten, könnten in Belgien um Asyl ansuchen, sagte der Flame dem flämischen Sender VTM News.

Der belgische Premierminister Charles Michel wies ihn laut Nachrichtenagentur Belga zurück: ""Ich bitte Theo Francken, kein Öl ins Feuer zu gießen.""

Hätte ein Asylantrag Puigdemonts Erfolg?

Ob ein Asylantrag Puigdemonts in Belgien Chancen hätte, gilt als sehr fraglich. Über den EU-Vertrag ist geregelt, dass sich die Mitgliedstaaten im Zusammenhang mit Asylangelegenheiten untereinander als sogenannte sichere Herkunftsländer betrachten - das heißt, es wird grundsätzlich davon ausgegangen, dass es in EU-Staaten keine Verfolgungsgefahr gibt.

Deshalb wurde festgelegt, dass der Asylantrag eines Staatsangehörigen eines Mitgliedstaats von einem anderen Mitgliedstaat nur unter ganz besondereren Bedingungen berücksichtigt werden darf.

Möglich wäre die Berücksichtigung des Asylantrages demnach nur dann, wenn Spanien unter Berufung auf einen Notstand die Verpflichtungen der Konvention zum Schutz der Menschenrechte und Grundfreiheiten aussetzen würde - oder wenn gegen das Land ein EU-Verfahren wegen des Verdachts auf schwerwiegende Verstöße gegen die Rechtsstaatlichkeit laufen würde.

Da beides nicht der Fall ist, müsste Belgien auf jeden Fall den Rat der EU-Mitgliedstaaten einschalten. Dieser dürfte wenig begeistert sein, wenn Belgien der spanischen Zentralregierung mit Asyl für Puigdemont in den Rücken fallen würde.

Bislang stehen die EU-Partner geschlossen hinter der Zentralregierung in Madrid, unter ihnen auch der belgische Premierminister Charles Michel, der nicht der flämischen Partei N-VA abgehört.

Face à ce cafouillage, une grande concertation avec les principaux acteurs de l'enseignement supérieur a été lancée et des propositions remises à la ministre de l'Education, à la mi-octobre.

Lundi 30 octobre, Frédérique Vidal doit trancher et exposer ce qui va venir relancer la plateforme APB, que la ministre a qualifié d'""à bout de souffle"". La grande question est de savoir qui aura le dernier mot: l'étudiant qui pourra intégrer n'importe quelle filière de son choix ou l'université qui pourra choisir les élèves qu'elle veut dans ses amphis.

Dans un entretien à L'Obs paru jeudi 26 octobre, Frédérique Vidal expliquait: ""Dans ce nouveau système, soit le lycéen dispose des compétences nécessaires pour suivre les cours auxquels il veut s'inscrire. Soit certaines bases ne sont pas acquises et dans ce cas, nous pourrions lui proposer un accompagnement spécifique"". Mais là encore, on ne savait pas si cet accompagnement pour acquérir les fameux ""prérequis"" aurait un caractère obligatoire.

Le tirage au sort, coupable tout désigné

Ce qui est certain, c'est que la ministre a promis de supprimer le tirage au sort, qui a très vite joué le rôle de coupable tout désigné dans le chaos des admissions 2017. Celui-ci était utilisé dès lors que la demande dans une filière dépassait les capacités d'accueil - ce sont les fameuses filières ""en tension"" comme médecine, droit ou STAPS. Ce moyen utilisé pour départager les candidats a cristallisé toutes les tensions autour de l'entrée à l'université.

Un ""énorme gâchis"", selon Frédérique Vidal, à tel point qu'en juillet elle déclarait: ""Le tirage au sort, c'est fini en 2018 (...) Le tirage au sort fait que des étudiants dont a priori on pense qu'ils auraient toutes les chances de réussir dans une filière n'y ont pas accès et que d'autres dont on sait qu'ils ont très peu de chances de réussir y ont accès. Il faut qu'on soit en capacité de donner une réelle information aux étudiants y compris sur leur probabilité de réussir"" à travers les 'prérequis'"".

Le tirage au sort était un peu le clou du spectacle de la plateforme APB. Les étudiants classaient leurs vœux par ordre de préférence, ce qui était déjà très stratégique, comme l'explique auprès du Monde Julien Grenet, chargé de recherche au CNRS et professeur associé à l'Ecole d'économie de Paris, spécialiste des algorithmes de répartition scolaire: ""Les élèves qui classent sincèrement leurs vœux (souvent les moins bien informés) sont donc pénalisés par l'algorithme, au profit des candidats stratégiques. Reste alors un dernier recours: le tirage au sort. Aussi injuste qu'aberrant.""

Ce tirage au sort, majoritairement perçu comme injuste, a même été jugé illégal par le tribunal administratif de Bordeaux. Trois étudiants avaient porté plainte après que leur candidature en L1 en Staps a été rejetée, faute de place. Après l'algorithme, le tirage au sort, considéré comme le dernier recours depuis une circulaire de l'Education nationale publiée en avril 2017, a donc été jugé contraire à la loi. ""Le moyen invoqué pour refuser l'inscription des étudiants en L1 de Staps à l'université (...) est tiré de l'illégalité des dispositions de la circulaire du 24 avril 2017. Qu'elles ajoutent le critère de tirage au sort (...) est propre à créer un doute sérieux quant à la légalité de la décision du recteur"" de refuser l'inscription des étudiants"", a affirmé le tribunal.

Si ce système est aussi injuste pourquoi avoir opté pour lui en premier lieu? Comme le rappelle auprès du Monde Julien Grenet, chargé de recherche au CNRS et professeur associé à l'Ecole d'économie de Paris, pendant longtemps en France, ""on utilisait alors le principe de la file d'attente: premier arrivé, premier servi"". Évidemment, on était très loin de la méritocratie à la française.

Prérequis et méritocratie

Avec les prérequis, en revanche, on s'en rapproche. Le Parisien affirme que le conseil de classe du second trimestre de terminale donnera un avis sur les vœux formulés par les élèves. Les facs auront ensuite accès à ces avis ainsi qu'aux notes obtenues avant le bac et seront donc amenées à répondre favorablement à la demande des futurs étudiants en fonction de leurs résultats. On peut facilement imaginer qu'un élève voulant faire médecine aura plus de chance d'être pris s'il a 17 de moyenne en SVT en filière S que s'il a 8.

De quoi se rapprocher de l'avis des Français. Selon un sondage Ipsos pour L'Obs, 66% des personnes interrogées se disent favorables à une telle forme de sélection à l'entrée en fac. 92% pensent même que les notes ainsi que la motivation de l'élève doivent entrer en compte. Et 80% des personnes interrogées estiment que le tirage au sort est injuste.

""Pour l'accès à l'université, la sélection sur prérequis est un procédé plus juste que celui reposant sur l'aléa: cette méthode de tri des candidatures correspond exactement au principe posé dans le code de l'éducation, avant même celui qui interdit la sélection, de la continuité des parcours entre le secondaire et le supérieur"", explique dans une tribune sur Libération Paul Cassia, professeur de droit public à l'université Paris 1. Selon lui, une telle sélection ""permettrait de revaloriser l'université sans porter atteinte au droit des bacheliers de s'inscrire dans une formation de l'enseignement supérieur: pour ceux qui n'auraient pas été retenus dans la formation de leur choix, les universités devraient les accueillir en année de sas, comportant des enseignements généralistes, dont la réussite conditionnerait l'accès en licence l'année universitaire suivante"".

Ce professeur, auteur de ""Sélectionner à l'entrée de l'université. Oui, mais comment?"" estime qu'en soi, le tirage au sort n'est pas ""une méthode farfelue de sélection: il garantit une égalité absolue dans la gestion de la rareté"", mais quand il s'agit de l'entrée à l'université, ""au-delà de l'égalitarisme de façade qu'il préserve, [il] est une source d'injustice et de gâchis"". Car les bacheliers se retrouvent dans des filières qui ne leur correspondent pas forcément.

Ascenseur social

Comme l'écrit dans Libération Blandine Parchemal, étudiante en philosophie et en administration publique, ""le tirage au sort s'établit à l'encontre du concept de méritocratie qui a constitué un des piliers fondamentaux autour duquel s'est construit le modèle républicain français"". Pas étonnant, de fait, qu'il cristallise autant de tensions. Avec le tirage au sort, adieu la ""promesse d'une ascension sociale (...) quelle que soit son origine, et suivant son seul talent ou son mérite"".

Pour elle, il s'agit pourtant bien ""du mode de sélection le plus égalitariste et le moins discriminant"". Citant la ""Théorie de la justice"" du philosophe John Rawls, elle explique que, l'origine sociale d'une personne impactant sa capacité à travailler et donc son mérite, ce n'est pas dans un système méritocratique qu'on est le plus égaux. ""La pratique du tirage au sort participe, à l'inverse, d'une démocratisation de l'accès à l'université"", écrit-elle.

Preuve que les prérequis ne font pas non plus l'unanimité, ils sont très décriés, notamment par les syndicats étudiants. L'Unef, par exemple, craint ""une possible sélection dans les filières en tension"" et milite pour un accès à l'enseignement supérieur libre à tous les étudiants. Les opposants appellent déjà à une mobilisation le 16 novembre prochain.

Deutschland hat gewählt und noch steht die Frage im Raum: Wer regiert künftig? Die nächsten Wochen und Monate werden voraussichtlich von einer langwierigen Regierungsbildung geprägt sein, mit der eine politische Ungewissheit einhergeht.

Unabhängig davon, ob sich eine Jamaika-Koalition bildet, doch eine große Koalition entsteht oder sogar Neuwahlen anstehen - die zukünftige Regierung übernimmt eine große Verantwortung in Zeiten des Wandels und der wirtschaftlichen Herausforderungen. Mit Blick auf die Zukunft Deutschlands als wirtschaftlicher Vorreiter muss das neue Kabinett nun mit klaren Forderungen in die Pflicht genommen werden.

Denn eines ist sicher: Wer die wirtschaftliche Zukunft Deutschlands sichern will, der muss in die Zukunft des Mittelstands und auch des Einzelhandels investieren. Ohne einen klaren politischen Fokus auf die Herausforderungen und Bedürfnisse des Handels werden wir in den nächsten Jahren ein Massensterben von kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen erleben.

Angesichts der volkswirtschaftlichen Bedeutung des Mittelstands und seiner zentralen Rolle in der Ausbildung von Fachkräften ist das bisherige Engagement der politischen Parteien nicht ausreichend und, vor allem, nicht zukunftsorientiert.

Insbesondere in Bezug auf die digitale Transformation muss ein Umdenken stattfinden, wenn Deutschland seinen Status als Spitzenwirtschaftsnation nicht gefährden will. In den Bereichen Qualifizierung von Arbeitskräften, Datenschutz und -sicherheit, digitale Infrastrukturen und Innovationsmanagement sind grundlegende Maßnahmen notwendig, um international wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben.

Die neue Bundesregierung muss die Chance nutzen, aus den Versäumnissen der Vergangenheit zu lernen und sich endlich den Herausforderungen des Einzelhandels zu stellen.

Qualifizierung forcieren

Um für die Zukunft gut aufgestellt zu sein und einem Fachkräftemangel entgegenzuwirken muss die Nachwuchsförderung ganz oben auf der politischen Agenda stehen - insbesondere in Bezug auf die Digitalisierung.

Denn für alle Unternehmen gilt: Die Berufsbilder und Kompetenzen, die mit der digitalen Transformation etwa in den Bereichen IT und Datensicherheit aufkommen, werden immer wichtiger. Auf der einen Seite ist eine verstärkte Förderung von betrieblich integriertem Wissenstransfer notwendig, um Fachpersonal nachhaltig zu binden.

Auf der anderen Seite muss die digitale Kompetenz des Lehrpersonals ausgebaut werden, um mit Blick auf die nachfolgenden Generationen international wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben.

Ausbau der digitalen Infrastruktur

Im Bereich der digitalen Anbindung hinkt Deutschland - einstiger Vorreiter im Bereich der Infrastruktur - weit hinterher. Eine umfassende und flächendeckende digitale Infrastruktur ist jedoch die Basis für die Förderung von Fachkräften, für Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Innovation.

Die gerade diskutierte Breitbandversorgung mit 50 Mbit/s, kann nur ein Etappenziel darstellen und muss langfristig einer flächendeckenden Versorgung mit 100 Mbit/s und mehr weichen. Der Ausbau des Glasfasernetzes muss daher dringend beschleunigt und die Voraussetzungen für funkbasierte Netze geschaffen werden.

Gerade der ländliche Raum, Sitz zahlreicher Mittelständler und Handelsunternehmen, muss hierbei Vorrang haben.

Vor dem Hintergrund der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit des Handels muss die Politik zudem die Rahmenbedingungen dafür schaffen, dass sich der Handel in Verbundgruppen digital zusammenschließen und professionalisieren kann.

Dazu gehört beispielsweise der gemeinsame Zugriff auf Kundendaten, der durch die sogenannte EPrivacy-Verordnung verhindert wird. Nur durch eine zentrale Distributions- und Preispolitik kann der Handel zukunftsfest bleiben.

Klare Vorgaben bei der Datensicherheit

Gleichzeitig müssen von der Politik endlich klare und praxisorientierte Regelungen für das Thema Datenschutz und -sicherheit vorgelegt werden. Die aktuellen Vorgaben sind oft überregulierend, extrem komplex und stellen besonders kleine Unternehmen vor große Herausforderungen, die einem fairen Wettbewerb mit Großunternehmen entgegenstehen.

Die Politik muss daher schnellstmöglich einen übersichtlichen und leicht umsetzbaren Handlungsrahmen entwickeln, der sowohl Rechtssicherheit und Schutz vor Cyberkriminalität gewährleistet als auch kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen einen gewissen rechtssicheren Spielraum bei der Nutzung von Daten lässt.

Innovationskraft fordern und fördern

Die Politik muss zudem durch die Forderung und Förderung von Innovationskraft Anreize für den Mittelstand schaffen, selbst zu forschen und zu entwickeln.

Es muss ein Bewusstsein für die Notwendigkeit aber auch Attraktivität von unternehmensinternen Future Labs geschaffen werden. Das Ziel ist ein innovativer deutscher Mittelstand, auch in forschungsarmen Branchen wie dem Handel.

Die Politik muss handeln

Kleine und mittlere Unternehmen erwirtschaften über ein Drittel des gesamten Umsatzes aller deutschen Unternehmen. Sie beschäftigen mehr als die Hälfte aller sozialversicherungspflichtigen Beschäftigten - mehr als 16 Millionen. Und: Mittelständische Betriebe sind verantwortlich für mehr als 80% aller Auszubildenden in Deutschland.

Die Aussage, der Mittelstand sei Deutschlands Zukunft, ist daher keine Leerformel sondern ein volkswirtschaftlicher Fakt.

Die zukünftigen politischen Entscheidungsträger müssen die Bedürfnisse des Mittelstandes ernst nehmen und eine gezielte Politik für den Mittelstand vor dem Hintergrund der digitalen Transformation betreiben.

Dazu gehört auch eine Antwort auf die Frage, wie man gegen den Mehrwertsteuerbetrug durch global agierende Internetplattformen vorgehen will, der den Wettbewerb zu Lasten des heimischen Mittelstands verzerrt. Die Politik muss handeln.

Über Günter Althaus:

Als Präsident des Mittelstandsverbundes ZGV und als Vorstandsvorsitzender der ANWR Group vertritt Günter Althaus die Interessen von tausenden kleineren und mittleren Unternehmen in Deutschland. Die Digitalisierung versteht er als essentiellen Schritt in die Zukunft, denn sie verändert rasant alle Geschäftsmodelle und die gesamte Arbeitswelt. Für kleinere und mittlere Unternehmen, die mit dieser Herausforderung am stärksten kämpfen, sieht er die besten Chancen in gemeinschaftlichen Aktivitäten und einer konkreten Zielsetzung. Günter Althaus ist außerdem Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender der DZB Bank und der AKTIVBANK und Mitglied im Präsidium des Handelsverbandes HDE.

JUSTICE - L'islamologue et théologien Tariq Ramadan, visé par deux récentes plaintes pour viol, a réagi pour la première fois samedi 28 octobre dans la soirée en publiant, sur sa page Facebook, un message dénonçant une ""campagne de calomnie clairement orchestrée par (ses) ennemis de longue date"".

Le théologien suisse, visé depuis lundi par une enquête à Paris pour ""viol, agression sexuelle, violences et menaces de mort"", s'exprimait au lendemain de la révélation d'une nouvelle plainte, déposée à Paris jeudi et qui dénonce des faits similaires. Selon Le Monde et Le Parisien, le récit de cette femme, qui fournit des certificats médicaux à l'appui, fait état de ""scènes de violence sexuelle d'une grande brutalité"". Elles se seraient déroulées dans un grand hôtel de Lyon en octobre 2009.

Ces accusations sont simplement fausses"" Tariq Ramadan

Ce témoignage succède à celui d'une ancienne salafiste devenue militante féministe et laïque: Henda Ayari, 40 ans, a publié ses accusations sur sa page Facebook le 20 octobre, en plein débat autour du harcèlement sexuel dans la société. Elle a été entendue mardi par les enquêteurs sur ces faits qui remonteraient à 2012 à Paris.

""Serein et déterminé""

Alors que son avocat a annoncé avoir porté plainte lundi pour ""dénonciation calomnieuse"", Tariq Ramadan affirme qu'une ""nouvelle plainte sera déposée dans les prochains jours puisque mes adversaires ont enclenché la machine à mensonges"".

""Je suis depuis plusieurs jours la cible d'une campagne de calomnie qui fédère assez limpidement mes ennemis de toujours"", écrit (en anglais) ce professeur d'études islamiques contemporaines à l'université d'Oxford en Grande-Bretagne. ""Malheureusement, cela s'annonce comme un long et difficile combat pour nous"", écrit-il à l'adresse de ""ceux qui (lui) ont exprimé soutien et affection"".

""La calomnie est toujours répréhensible. Les allégations infondées ne doivent jamais prendre la place de la vérité. Ces accusations sont simplement fausses et trahissent tous les idéaux pour lesquels je me suis battu et auxquels j'ai toujours cru"", martèle-t-il.

""Il est triste de voir nos adversaires réduits à soutenir l'imposture et la tromperie érigées en vertu"", poursuit-il avant de conclure: ""le droit doit maintenant parler, mon avocat est en charge de ce dossier, nous nous attendons à un long et âpre combat. Je suis serein et déterminé"".

A Canadian couple say they narrowly averted being deported from the United Arab Emirates, and are out thousands of dollars, because of an airline clerk who ripped one of their passports.

What's more, they say their situation was made worse by bad advice given by the airline: that it's safe to travel with a damaged passport.

Juhi Sharma and her husband Akshay Kumar, both photographers in the Toronto area, say a representative working for Irish airline Aer Lingus tore Kumar's passport while they were checking in for a flight to the United Arab Emirates on Oct. 13 at Toronto's Pearson Airport.

Akshay Kumar and Juhi Sharma in a Facebook photo.

When Kumar was given back a torn passport and asked what had happened to it, the airline rep ""did not have the decency to respond to my husband's question,"" Sharma wrote on her Facebook page. She described the rep's behaviour as ""rude.""

Eventually, they say, an Aer Lingus manager at the airport told them they would not face any problems travelling on the damaged passport.

""There won't be (a problem), this happens all the time,"" the manager reportedly told them.

That advice goes against the government of Canada's warning to travellers that ""if you travel with a damaged passport, you could face delays or be denied entry at border crossings, or on flights.""

Despite misgivings about the advice they were given, the couple flew to the United Arab Emirates — where border officials at the airport told Kumar he would be deported back to Toronto, because he was travelling on a damaged passport.

""My husband and I burst into tears with the thought of not being able to go through (with) our plan,"" Sharma wrote.

Watch: The world's safest airlines revealed

Sharma told HuffPost Canada in a phone interview that it appeared U.A.E. customs officials doubted Kumar's identity.

The couple managed to convince U.A.E. authorities not to deport them by agreeing to continue immediately to the next leg of their vacation, India.

They say they are now stuck in Chandidargh, India, while they await a new passport for Kumar from the Indian government. Kumar is an Indian citizen and a permanent resident of Canada.

""Things are getting really stressful and we really feel helpless at this point,"" Sharma said in a Facebook conversation with HuffPost.

An Aer Lingus plane taxis before take-off at Dublin airport, Jan. 27, 2015. Aer Lingus says it is ""looking into"" an incident in which a Toronto couple say they were nearly deported from the U.A.E. after an Aer Lingus rep ripped one of their passports.

The couple estimate their losses at more than $3,000, and considerably more than that if a new passport doesn't arrive in time and they miss their scheduled flight back to Toronto.

They have reached out to Etihad Airways, through which they booked their flight from Toronto to the U.A.E., as well as to Aer Lingus, asking for compensation. Etihad reportedly told them they were ""extremely sorry,"" but that the responsibility lies with Aer Lingus, which operated the first leg of Kumar and Sharma's flight.

Sharma says Aer Lingus responded to the couple's inquiries with only an automated response email.

Aer Lingus has so far told HuffPost Canada only that they are ""looking into this."" This story will be updated if and when the airline issues any further statement.

Incidents like this have come up in the past. An Air Canada passenger was denied entry into Mexico earlier this year, due to a passport he said was torn by an airline rep.

An Ontario woman was stopped from boarding a flight to Cuba in 2015 over a water-damaged passport.

The government of Canada has an information page on what to do about damaged, lost or stolen passports.

A rapidly-growing snowball effect that began with allegations against Hollywood director Harvey Weinstein, before encompassing Labour MP Jared O’Mara and government minister Mark Garnier so far shows no sign of slowing down. HuffPost UK talked to a number of current and ex-staff members, from across the political spectrum, working within parties and for individual MPs, about their experiences and concerns. One former Labour special adviser told of a lewd advance made towards her by a still-serving Tory MP while on the Commons terrace one sunny afternoon. “Recent events have made me think a lot about some of the incidents I experienced,” she said. “One that sticks out is something that happened after I’d actually left politics, but I’d come back to Parliament for a meeting and I was on the terrace. It was a nice day, it must have been about 4pm, and they had brought the leftover sandwiches out from an event.

“A Tory MP walked over to my table, and said ‘I just want to see if the sex kitten wants any of my sandwiches’. He looked really proud of himself, like he was paying me a big compliment. “I was completely mortified, as were all the people I was with. I just said ‘no thanks’. I think he genuinely thought he was being lovely. “There were so many incidents like that - just examples of deeply, deeply outdated attitudes towards women.” The former staffer said on another occasion, a then-senior Labour cabinet minister made her feel “very uncomfortable” at a party conference event. “He kept going on and on about a blouse I was wearing, how it looked and the shape of it. It was just really awkward and he wouldn’t shut up about it. “These kinds of attitudes were just pervasive throughout politics. This idea that women were almost ornamental and you could speak to them in any way you liked.” MPs from across the Commons, including former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, leader of the House Andrea Leadsom and Tory backbencher Anna Soubry, have called for urgent action to be taken to address a “culture of sexual harassment” between members and their staff. Theresa May pledged to write to John Bercow, the Speaker of the House, to ask for his help in tackling the issue - but despite the PM’s tough talk, only a single minister has been placed under investigation.

PA Wire/PA Images

Another former party staffer, who worked for Labour both in government and opposition, said: “I think the worst thing was being warned as young woman not to be in a car alone with certain ministers. “When I first got into politics, as a young researcher, older friends would warn you to make sure you weren’t alone with certain male politicians at conference parties.” One former researcher for a since-retired Tory MP told friends his boss “on more than one occasion asked if he would - ‘for fun’ - wear plastic breasts in the office and dance around.” Another former senior staff member said: “I once knew of an MP who had a work experience student staying at his flat. He actually got into this guy’s bed ‘for a cuddle’. “This sort of thing was totally ingrained in the culture. Probably still is.” A senior Lib Dem source confirmed the issues span the entire political spectrum and have done for several years. “The split in the Parliamentary party - when we had one - [on who to avoid] was always the God botherers and the women botherers,” they told HuffPost UK. Other current staff members, who asked not to be identified because of the potential impact on their careers, confirmed there had been little improvement in recent years. “We have all known for years which MPs to avoid, but I don’t think anyone will actually come forward and speak out about some of them,” one said.

PA Wire/PA Images

Responding to an urgent question tabled in the Commons on Monday afternoon, Leadsom said events in recent days were in danger of bringing Parliament into disrepute. The Leader of the House said Parliament needs a new independent body to protect MPs’ staff from abuse and unwanted attention. Speaker John Bercow agreed members needed to act “swiftly” to tackle what he branded a “disturbing” culture. But Baroness Anne Jenkin, who with Theresa May co-founded Women2Win, a campaign to increase the number of female Conservative MPs, cautioned against creating an environment where false allegations could be made. She told HuffPost UK: “Of course it is stating the obvious that unwanted sexual behaviour is unacceptable in any walk of life and must be stamped out. “However, I think there is a danger, in the current environment swirling with gossip and intrigue, of creating an atmosphere where people are afraid to say anything and just retreat into themselves, which would be really quite depressing. Or even that unsubstantiated allegations can be made without any proof. “I am not suggesting for one minute that there is not some behaviour that goes on that is beyond inappropriate. Properly predatory behaviour, grooming and such like, of young women and young men, has to be stamped out as a matter of urgency.”

PA Archive/PA Images

Jenkin, who has sat in the House of Lords since 2011, said the “vast majority” of incidents could be resolved “through people using common sense and good manners”. “This is a matter for Parliament to sort out and I look forward to seeing the Speaker’s response to the Prime Minister’s letter,” she added. ″I would be the first to come down on such behaviour like a tonne of bricks, if it were brought to my attention. Everyone knows I am hugely supportive of the Conservative women MPs and I am sure they, and I hope their staff, would come to me if there was a problem. Or someone else in authority who will take allegations seriously. “I have actually put out a message asking anyone to get in touch with me with any concerns, and so far nobody has.” But Unite, the union which represents hundreds of Parliamentary staff, said the issue could not be left to political parties alone to deal with. It urged any employee with concerns to get in touch with their union rep and said the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), the Commons watchdog, needed to do more to support its efforts.

Mit ""House of Cards"" knüpfte Kevin Spacey endlich wieder an große Erfolge an - die komplette fünfte Staffel gibt es hier!

Als Kind von der Schauspielerei fasziniert

Kevin Spacey wurde in South Orange, New Jersey geboren. Durch die häufigen Jobwechsel seines Vaters musste die Familie häufig umziehen, wie es unter anderem auf der offiziellen Homepage des Schauspielers heißt. Bereits früh habe er sich für die Schauspielerei interessiert, da er heimlich nachts Filme angesehen habe.

Er versuchte sich zunächst als Comedian

Erste Schauspielerfahrungen machte Spacey an der Highschool. Nach dem Abschluss versuchte er sich einige Jahre lang als Stand-up-Comedian. Offenbar nicht mit dem gewünschten Erfolg. Denn es zog Spacey schließlich an die renommierte Juilliard School in New York, wo er ab 1979 Schauspiel studierte. Im Frühling 1981 verließ er die Schule ohne ein Diplom.

Alles begann am Theater

Zunächst blieben die Engagements aus und Spacey schlug sich zum Beispiel als Angestellter in einem Theater durch. Doch die klammen Jahre hatten ein Ende, als eines Tages ein Angebot vom Theater kam. Kurz darauf zog Spacey weiter an den Broadway und feierte dort erste Erfolge. 1991 heimste er einen Tony Award für seine Darbietung im Stück ""Lost in Yonkers"" ein.

Er hat zwei Oscars

Seinen weltweiten Durchbruch feierte Spacey dann auf der Kino-Leinwand. 10 Jahre nach seinem ersten Film ""Sodbrennen"" (1986) bekam er seinen ersten Oscar verliehen. Für seine Leistung in Bryan Singers (52) ""Die üblichen Verdächtigen"" wurde Spacey als ""Bester Nebendarsteller"" ausgezeichnet. Nur vier Jahre später folgte der Oscar als ""Bester Hauptdarsteller"" im Drama ""American Beauty"".

Er erlebt seinen zweiten Frühling

Nach seinem zweiten Oscar-Gewinn konnte Spacey mit seinen folgenden Filmen nicht mehr an den ganz großen Erfolg anknüpfen. Er konzentrierte sich fortan verstärkt auf seine alte Liebe - das Theater. Durch die Netflix-Serie ""House of Cards"" sorgt Spacey seit 2013 wieder weltweit für Schlagzeilen. Spacey wurde fünf Jahre in Folge für einen Emmy nominiert. 2015 gewann er den Golden Globe als ""Bester Hauptdarsteller in einer Dramaserie"" für seine Darstellung des skrupellosen Francis ""Frank"" Underwood.

Spacey sammelt Ehrentitel

Spacey trägt übrigens einige Ehrentitel. So bekam er im November 2005 zum Beispiel den Ehrendoktortitel als Doctor of Letters von der London South Bank University verliehen. Außerdem erhielt der Schauspieler 2010 den britischen Verdienstorden Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Für seine Verdienste um das Londoner Old Vic Theatre, bei dem er von 2003 bis 2015 als künstlerischer Leiter tätig war, wurde er zudem von Queen Elizabeth II. ehrenhalber zum Knight Commander of the British Empire ernannt. Das ""Sir"" darf er aber nicht als Namenszusatz tragen - da er US-Amerikaner ist.",Kevin Spacey: Das muss man über den Oscar-Gewinner wissen,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/30/kevin-spacey-das-muss-man-uber-den-oscar-gewinner-wissen_n_18419766.html

Das macht mich nicht zu einem schlechten Menschen, aber sicher auch nicht zu einem guten.","Es gibt Momente im Leben, wo das eigene Selbstbild plötzlich völlig in Frage gestellt wird. Momente, wo fast alles, woran man geglaubt hat, sich als falsch erweist.

So einen Moment hatte ich vor Kurzem in der U-Bahn.

Ich dachte eigentlich immer von mir, dass ich ein offener Mensch sei. Liberal, aber gegen Rassismus, würde ich für meine Werte einstehen und diese - wenn nötig - auch verteidigen.

Jetzt weiß ich, dass ich falsch lag.

Ich war vor ein paar Tagen in der U-Bahn unterwegs. Autofahren war nie so mein Ding und die Dellen in meinem alten Wagen geben mir da recht. Daher habe ich schon seit Jahren eine Monatskarte.

Als ein gekünstelt freundliches ""Servus, die Fahrscheine bitte!"" durch den Wagon gerufen wurde, war ich daher auch wenig beunruhigt.

Routiniert zeigte ich mein Ticket, der Kontrolleur schaute ebenso routiniert drauf und wandte sich dem älteren Ehepaar mir gegenüber zu, die es mir gleich taten. So ging es dann immer weiter, ein Fahrgast nach dem anderen.

So weit, so unspektakulär.

""Das ist typisch bei denen. Die Schwarzen denken, hier ist alles umsonst""

Plötzlich kam es zu einer Unterbrechung. Ein dunkelhäutiges Paar mit Kinderwagen hatte offensichtlich keine Fahrkarte dabei. Beide sprachen kein Deutsch, waren sich aber augenscheinlich bewusst, um was es ging.

Die Frau schien verunsichert, dem Mann war es wohl einfach nur sehr peinlich.

Die Bayern sind für ihre grantige Art bekannt und der Kontrolleur, der keine Anstalten machte, es auch auf Englisch zu versuchen, war hier keine Ausnahme. Er war nicht beleidigend, hatte aber diese typisch ruppige Art, die man entweder liebt oder eben nicht.

Der Kontrolleur wollte den Ausweis sehen, der Mann verstand nicht und hielt sein geöffnetes Portemonnaie hin. Vielleicht dachte er, man könne im Zug nachzahlen, oder er wollte direkt die Strafe zahlen, vielleicht auch etwas ganz Anderes - das kann ich nicht genau sagen, denn meine Aufmerksamkeit wurde unterbrochen.

""Das ist typisch bei denen. Die Schwarzen denken, hier ist alles umsonst - aber das stimmt nicht.""

Dieser Satz kam von dem älteren Mann, der gegenüber in meinem Vierersitz saß. Er sagte das zu niemandem im Besonderen, aber in diesem speziellen Ton, der zeigt, dass ihn alle in der Bahn hören sollten. Auch der Kontrolleur und der schwarze Mann.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An die Neonazis neben mir in der U-Bahn

Ich weiß nicht, was es war. War es Peinlichkeit? Oder war es Angst? Schwer zu sagen. Auf jeden Fall war ich baff.

Der Mann ist in einem ganz gut besuchten U-Bahn-Abteil, umringt von Menschen, in einer der reichsten Städte Deutschlands, und hat keinerlei Vorbehalte, seine rassistischen Pauschalaussagen laut auszusprechen.

Er legte sogar noch nach.

""Natürlich mit Kind. Die vermehren sich rasant. Und das gibt auch mehr Mitleid.""

Die Bahn hielt, die Tür öffnete sich, der Kontrolleur und die Familie stieg aus, um die Sache weiter außerhalb des Zugs zu klären und wir fuhren wieder los.

Die Situation war vorbei, der Mann hatte seinen Teil gesagt und alle, inklusive mir, haben geschwiegen.

Ich weiß genau, was mein Schweigen anrichtete

Ich saß noch zwei weitere Stationen dem Mann gegenüber, habe starr aus dem Fenster in die Dunkelheit der U-Bahn-Schächte geschaut, bis ich ausgestiegen bin.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An die Münchnerin im Bus, die sich nicht von einem türkischen Jungen helfen lassen wollte

Mit schnellen Schritten ging ich nach Hause, klappte meinen Laptop auf und startete die erstbeste Serie auf Netflix. Schnell den Kopf mit irgendwelchen belanglosen Kram füllen, um nicht darüber nachzudenken, was eigentlich gerade passiert war.

Das hat für den ersten Moment auch funktioniert, aber nicht dauerhaft. Denn ich weiß genau, was mein Schweigen anrichtete.

Ein offensichtlicher Rassist hat in einer Gruppe von ca. 60 Mitfahrern seinen Hass verbreitet. Den Grund für seine Haltung kennen ich nicht. Vielleicht hat er schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht, vielleicht fällt er auf rechte Medien rein, vielleicht ist er so erzogen worden. Das weiß ich alles nicht, was ich aber sicher weiß, ist das mein Schweigen ihn in seiner Sicht bestätigt.

Niemand hat ihm widersprochen. Er hat laut seine Meinung gesagt und 60 Menschen haben kein Widerwort gegeben.

In seinem Kopf ist klar, was das bedeutet. Wenn er Unrecht gehabt hätte, hätte ihm doch wer widersprochen. Hat aber niemand, also müssen ja alle seiner Meinung sein.

Ich wollte mutig sein, aber habe versagt

Wenn ich auf Facebook Kommentare lese, wie ""die meisten Deutschen wachen ja jetzt auf"", ""die Mehrheit der Deutschen ist gegen die ausländischen Besatzer"" oder Klassiker wie ""wir sind das Volk"", ""wir sind Bürger, keine Nazis"", dann kommt das genau von solchen Situationen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich bin dunkelhäutig und Deutsche - trotzdem werde ich oft wie eine Fremde behandelt

Der Mann glaubt jetzt, dass die meisten Leute so denken wir er.

Auch wundert es nicht, wenn die Rechten in den Medien und sozialen Netzwerken so stark vertreten sind.

Natürlich schreiben die Nachrichtenseiten öfters über den neuen Hass-Tweet von irgendeinem AfD-Politiker als über die tolle Antwort der Nazi-Gegner. Denn viel zu selten kommt eine Antwort.

Ich mache mir keine Illusionen. Die politische Lage in Deutschland hätte sich nicht verändert, wenn ich etwas gesagt hätte. Wahrscheinlich hätte ich nicht mal den Mann in der U-Bahn umstimmen können.

Es hätte aber ein Zeichen sein können. An den Mann, dass nicht alle seiner Meinung sind und an alle in der Bahn, wie einfach es ist, ""Nein"" zu sagen.

Nein.

Früher habe ich laut Konstantin Weckers ""Sage Nein!"" gesungen.

""Ob du sechs bist oder hundert,

sei nicht nur erschreckt, verwundert,

tobe, zürne, misch dich ein

sage nein!""

Ich habe mir vor einiger Zeit vorgenommen, mutiger zu sein. Als die Chance sich bot, habe ich versagt. Das macht mich nicht zu einem schlechten Menschen, aber sicher auch nicht zu einem guten.

As the story circulated, many people had pretty strong reactions to the idea that the 48-year-old cricket legend could be handing out roses next year.

Shane Warne becoming the next Bachelor is proof the world ended a year ago and we are all in purgatory. — Elli🤔tt Smith (@elliottnz) October 29, 2017

While it seemed unbelievable at first, the story did make a lot of sense. Warne, whose Twitter bio features the phrase ""still single"", is no stranger to Network Ten's reality outings, having previously featured on 'I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!'.

It also would be on the back of a hugely successful season of 'The Bachelorette' starring Sophie Monk, which proved having a celebrity at the helm prompted a ratings boom, and created some of the best moments on TV this year.

Unfortunately it looked like it wasn't meant to be, as Warnie wrote on Twitter later on Monday that the story wasn't true.

Once AGAIN ""No Idea"" has completely made up a story about me being the new bachelor ! This is hurtful to me & my children as it's total lies — Shane Warne (@ShaneWarne) October 29, 2017

Ps I have not had one conversation with anyone about this. How can they continue to print lies about me, make up stories & get away with it? — Shane Warne (@ShaneWarne) October 29, 2017

So there you have it, unless Warnie is throwing us a curve ball (or the cricket version of that) it looks like his stint as The Bachelor isn't going to happen. It also comes amid hints Monk's third-placer Apollo Jackson would be the next Bachelor, so this might all be a big joke.

Though if you'll remember, Sophie Monk's journey all started with a joke on 'Hard Chat With Tom Gleeson', so who knows what'll happen next?","Unfortunately For Us, Shane Warne Probably Isn't Going To Be The Next Bachelor",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/29/unfortunately-for-us-shane-warne-probably-isnt-going-to-be-the-next-bachelor_a_23260068/

Eine Frau und eine Frau.","Ein muslimischer Geschäftsmann sorgt mit einer Datingseite für Aufregung

Seine Online Partnervermittlung ""Secondwife"" hilft muslimischen Männern, Zweit- oder gar Dritt- und Viertfrauen zu finden und hat bereits über 100.000 Nutzer

Kritiker fordern die Abschaffung der Webseite, da sie gegen wesentliche europäische Grundrechte verstößt

Wer mehr als einen Partner heiratet, also in Polygamie lebt, macht sich in allen europäischen Ländern strafbar. In England gibt es dafür sogar bis zu sieben Jahre Haft. Das ist für den Briten Azad Chaiwala kein Hindernis.

Der 33-jährige Geschäftsmann ist Betreiber von secondwife.com, einer Webseite für muslimische Männer auf der Suche nach Zweitfrauen - wer will, kann hier auch eine dritte oder vierte finden.

Laut der britischen Zeitung ""Daily Mail"" zählt die Webseite, die in Dubai angemeldet ist, bereits 100.000 Mitglieder weltweit. Wer denkt, die Seite sei nur in arabischen Ländern ein Hit, der irrt - allein in Großbritannien gibt es 25.000 angemeldete Nutzer von Secondwife.

Und täglich kommen neue Nutzer dieses digitalen Heiratsmarktes dazu.

Der Grund für die starke Nachfrage ist klar

Der Grund für die starke Nachfrage ist für Chaiwala klar. Es gebe eine große Notwendigkeit nach seinem Service und er komme der Nachfrage nur nach.

""Die Idee zu der Webseite kam aufgrund von meinen eigenen Bedürfnissen, und ich denke, dass auch andere Menschen in meiner Situation sind"", sagte er dem britischen Nachrichtensender BBC.

Mit seiner Online-Partnervermittlung will er das Image der Polygamie ändern. Chaiwala, der selbst Polygamist ist, stellt es eins der letzten verbliebenen sozialen Tabus dar, dabei seien monogame Beziehungen als Fundament für die Ehe untauglich. Polygamie führe zu ""größeren und besseren Familien"", sagt Chaiwala.

Und prophezeit: Auch in Europa werde Polygamie bald legal sein, da man Ehen mit ""kühlem Kopf"" schließen und das ""Chaos der Gefühle"" vermeiden solle.

Bei ""Secondwife"" handelt es sich seiner Meinung nach um nichts Verbotenes. ""Altmodische und konservative Werte"" würden durch sein Projekt sogar gefördert, da mehrere Ehefrauen im Islam ausdrücklich erlaubt seien und seine Webseite sich ausdrücklich an muslimische Männer richte.

Seine Leitidee sei ein Auszug aus dem Koran: ""Dann heiratet, was euch an Frauen gut scheint, zwei, drei oder vier. Wenn ihr aber befürchtet, nicht gerecht zu handeln, dann (nur) eine ..."" - Sure 4: an-Nisa.

Die Idee hinter der arabischen Webseite verstößt aber eindeutig gegen die Gesetze in europäischen Ländern.

In Deutschland beispielsweise wird die Mehrfachehe mit einer Freiheitsstrafe von bis zu drei Jahren oder Geldstrafe geahndet. Bundesjustizminister Heiko Maas (SPD) möchte in Deutschland klare Grenzen ziehen. Die Polygamie dürfe hier keinen Platz finden: ""Deshalb dürfen in Deutschland keine Mehrfach-Ehen anerkannt werden"", kündigte er vor einem guten Jahr in der “Bild”-Zeitung an.

Frauen wie ""Schmuckstücke""

Aktuell gibt es aber kaum einen Schutz gegen unregistrierte Ehen. Wer in Deutschland in einer polygamen Beziehung lebt, aber diese nirgendwo meldet, hat eine gute Chance, nie erwischt zu werden. Eine Zweitfrau könnte also auch hier vermittelt werden, nur kann sie nicht offiziell geheiratet werden.

Kritiker laufen Sturm und fordern, dass die Webseite abgestellt wird. Frauen würden wie ""Schmuckstücke"" behandelt und gesammelt werden.

Eine Twitter Nutzerin kommentierte seine Aussage, Polygamie führe zu einer ""größeren und besseren"" Familie: ""Polygamie zerstört Familien.""

-Reporter als 18-jährige Frau aus und meldete sich auf der Plattform an. Es wurde nicht einmal ein Altersnachweis von ihm verlangt. Ihm seien sofort muslimische Männer im Alter von 30 bis 60 Jahren aus der Gegend präsentiert worden.

Chaiwala lässt die Kritik kalt. Seine Webseite verstoße nicht gegen das Gesetz, betont er, stattdessen stehe sie nur sinnbildlich für die Veränderung in der Gesellschaft – bis die Legalisierung von Polygamie dann endlich vollzogen sei.

To make matters worse, later in the interview Sandler later touched Thompson's leg, despite his 'Meyerwitz Stories' co-star looking unimpressed throughout the awkward interactions.

Thompson has been incredibly vocal about the recent allegations surrounding Harvey Weinstein and in an interview with BBC Newsnight, blasted the system and old defenses of such behaviour.

""This has been part of our world, women's world, since time immemorial,"" she continued.

After the criticism, Page Six reported that a spokesman for Sandler called the incident a ""friendly gesture"" that had been blown out of proportion.

“We didn’t get counselling,” she tells HuffPost UK. “We were warned about what the reaction might be like, but we weren’t given any counselling, which is a shame. “Not for me, because nobody was interested in a middle-aged mum from suburbia. But for some of the younger ones I think it would have been really useful, because I was very ignorant about how awful people could be on social media.” She adds: “I was very new to social media last year and I have been completely shocked by how horrible people are to some of these young people. They’re absolutely wicked and I don’t think anybody should be faced with that. “We’re on a nice family baking show and people are hideous. The things that they posted were awful and I think perhaps a bit of counselling might help.”

While Jane feels that counselling would help, she did have one piece of advice for the 2017 bakers. “The one bit of counselling I’d give is don’t Google yourself,” she says. “If someone hasn’t tagged you in a tweet, don’t go looking for it because all the cowards will tweet all the horrible stuff and not tag you so just don’t go looking for it, just enjoy the good stuff.”

Jane explains that she felt very protective of her fellow bakers throughout last year’s show, especially as they all bonded so well. She says: “We’re all very close in our year. We all got on very well and we do speak to or message each other almost every day. “All of us supported each other and the older ones like Val, Lee, Louise and me didn’t take any of the abuse, well not that we saw any of it anyway, so we could wrap [the younger contestants] in a blanket and try and help them along. “Ultimately these people are there on your phones and computers and when you’re having a bad day, they kind of get in wherever you are. “That’s the thing with social media, you’re not safe anywhere and I think it would be really good if there was a way of filtering out some of that abuse. I mean it’s not hard because some of it’s visual. “Some of the pictures that are sent through are positively obscene and I don’t know how they slip through, so I think it’s up to responsible social media providers to try and filter that out for everybody.

""Call of Duty: WWII""

""Star Wars Battlefront II"" und die anderen vorgestellten Games können Sie hier (vor-)bestellen

Wie in jedem Jahr bekommen Shooter-Fans eine Auskopplung der ""Call of Duty""-Reihe. 2017 sind viele allerdings besonders gespannt, denn nach mehreren Jahren kehrt die Serie zu ihren Wurzeln zurück. Statt auf moderne oder gar futuristische Kriegsführung zu setzen, spielt ""Call of Duty: WWII"" im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Der Shooter, der am 3. November für PC, PS4 und Xbox One erscheint, hat neben einer mitreißenden Kampagne natürlich zudem wieder zahlreiche Mehrspieler-Modi zu bieten - darunter auch den beliebten ""Zombies""-Modus.

""Star Wars Battlefront II""

Nicht weniger Vorfreude verspüren viele Shooter-Liebhaber, wenn sie an den 17. November denken. Dann geht es für PC-, PS4- und Xbox-One-Spieler nämlich wieder in eine ""weit, weit entfernte Galaxis"". In massiven Sci-Fi-Schlachten kämpfen sich in ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" bis zu 40 Spieler gleichzeitig durch actiongeladene Multiplayer-Modi - teils in der Rolle von neuen und alten Franchise-Ikonen wie Rey, Darth Vader, Han Solo oder Darth Maul. Erstmals gibt es auch eine Einzelspieler-Story, die eine neue ""Star Wars""-Geschichte erzählt, die nach ""Die Rückkehr der Jedi-Ritter"" spielt.

""Sonic Forces""

Nachdem Nintendos Ex-Klempner im Oktober mit ""Super Mario Odyssey"" zurückgekehrt ist, gibt sich am 7. November eine andere Hüpf-Legende die Ehre: Sonic! Auf Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4 und Xbox One gibt der blaue Sega-Igel in ""Sonic Forces"" wieder kräftig Gas, um wieder einmal die düsteren Pläne von Bösewicht Dr. Eggman zu vereiteln. Doch es gibt noch einen weiteren Gegenspieler! Spieler schlüpfen in ""Sonic Forces"" in die Rollen des modernen und klassischen Sonic, aber auch in die digitale Haut eines eigenen Charakters.

""Pokémon Ultrasonne"" und ""Pokémon Ultramond""

Auch die kultigen Pokémon-Minimonster bekommen ab dem 17. November auf 3DS zwei neue Games. ""Pokémon Ultrasonne"" und ""Pokémon Ultramond"" sind zwar in der gleichen Welt wie die 2016 erschienen ""Pokémon Sonne"" und ""Pokémon Mond"" angesiedelt, erzählen aber eine alternative Geschichte. Mit dabei sind unter anderem auch neue Pokémon und frische Elemente, die es in den Vorgängern noch nicht gab.

""Need for Speed: Payback""

Gamer, die den ""Need for Speed"" spüren, werden vermutlich mit ""Payback"" glücklich, dem neuen Teil der gleichnamigen, langjährigen Rennspielreihe. Ab dem 10. November besinnt man sich auf PC, PS4 und Xbox One auf alte Stärken. Jede Menge Action, Verfolgungsjagden, Tuning, unzählige Traumwagen - alles was das Raserherz begehrt, ist mit dabei. Auch eine Story hat das Game zu bieten, die Spieler in die zwielichtige Unterwelt des fiktiven Fortune Valley entführt.

""The Inpatient""

Nach ihrem Horror-Hit ""Until Dawn"" bringen die Briten von Supermassive Games 2017 neben ""Hidden Agenda"" auch den PlayStation-VR-Grusel ""The Inpatient"" heraus, der 60 Jahre vor ""Until Dawn"" spielt. Ohne Erinnerungen wacht der Spieler im Blackwood Pines Sanatorium auf und muss herausfinden, was in der Nervenheilanstalt vor sich geht. Ab 22. November ist das Standalone-Spiel, für das man den PS4-Vorgänger nicht gespielt haben muss, erhältlich.

""Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2""

Neue Superhelden-Action in einer bunten Klötzchenwelt erwarten Kinder und Junggebliebene ab dem 14. November mit ""Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2"" auf Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4 und Xbox One. Aufgepeppt mit dem bekannten Lego-Humor schlüpfen Spieler abermals in die Rollen bekannter Marvel-Superhelden und -Superschurken und erleben spannende Abenteuer für die ganze Familie. Unter anderem mit dabei: die Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Doktor Strange und viele weitere Figuren.

""L.A. Noire""

Erstmals 2011 erschienen, bekommt ""L.A. Noire"", das vielgelobte Detektivabenteuer von Rockstar Games mit Film-Noire-Setting, eine technisch überarbeitete Neuauflage für Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One und HTC Vive. Der Crime-Thriller spielt in einem Los Angeles der 1940er Jahre und lässt Spieler in der Rolle von Detective Cole Phelps zahlreiche Verbrechen aufklären. Neben dem Hauptspiel sind auch alle erschienenen Downloadinhalte im neuen Pack enthalten.

Xbox One X

Am 7. November veröffentlicht Microsoft eine neue Version seiner Heimkonsole.

Despite the best efforts of those who wish to protect them, cows and other bovines die as surely as sheep, goat and other domestic animals. In death too they become veritable source of useful materials and wealth. Men and women belonging to certain social formations engage in recovering the skins, bones and hooves of these animals. These materials find their use in downstream industry.

An anthropologist had commented that in India the social status of a group depends upon the frequency of contact the group members have with organic materials and the nature of those materials. Males from high castes have very little touch with any organic material during the course of their normal occupations. People from the middle castes tend to work with soil and with animals. Women constantly deal with organic material, etc.

We see the relevance of this hypothesis in the relative social status of the concerned people in the stagnant rural society. The flayers of skins and those who deal with bones, those who work with these skins to make leather and those who make footwear and other items deal with dead animals and their residues. As a result, they are forced to remain at the bottom rung of the society. And this ascribed status in the caste system perpetuates through generations.

We must naturally feel ashamed of this reality. But apparently, the disdain for people working with such materials is not unique to us. It may be seen across many societies. In the rare event when a few people had died in earthquake-led fires in Japan, the Prime Minister there sort of dismissed the tragedy saying, yes, but they were only leather workers.

The animal population in India is huge, exceeding 240 million animals of the bovine species alone. But the animals are held in a highly decentralized manner across a dispersed geography. Even within a village, dispersed households hold them in a decentralized manner. Animal deaths also occur in very scattered locations. Barely one or two families perhaps live in a village in order to utilize the resources in terms of carcasses of dead animals (cows, calves, bullocks, buffalos, mules, horses, camels, rabbits). This is the tragedy of the group. It is highly scattered across a wide terrain, and in each of its habitations, it is a hopeless minority.

Oppressed minority

The social formations engaged in work on animal residues in general are an oppressed lot across the entire country. Many diverse social and economic developments have been affecting them. During the seventies, for instance, there was a strong movement towards sanskritization in the group. The Caste Panchayat took the view that since the occupation of flaying the skins off dead animals was one that made their social status so low, they would refrain from doing so.

This resulted in the group experiencing livelihoods stress on one hand and environmental distress due to decaying animals on the other. The polity, ranging from formation of co-operatives to compulsory licensing for processing the carcass, gave complex responses. Also, some of those who dealt with bones took to skin work. Since there undoubtedly is an economic value in animal residues, it was inevitable that a combination of economic incentives and physical force would combine to make the hapless flayers continue to do the work.

The second important development that emergence of synthetic materials as a resource for making products hitherto made out of leather. The massive incursion of synthetic footwear in rural and urban economy has in the first instance affected the footwear makers (cobblers).

The effect on the upstream has also been severe but in part cushioned by the fact that a bulk of Indian hides and skins were exported for a substantial period of time. The difference between the economic engagements of the leather flayers earlier and now is that the contractor and aggregators that supply to the tanneries tend to be the chief economic actors they have to engage with. Due to the complex and often times hostile regulatory environment, these agents acquire monopolistic power over the leather flayers.

Vested interests

As in all lines of business, there are interest groups in the value chain of animal skins and hides. Allegations of each higher rung exploiting the lower rung are quite common. At the apex tends to be the leather product or leather exporters and at the bottom the leather flayers. While the occupation of leather flayers is essential to the smooth functioning of rural economy, those who practice the occupation are grossly exploited and neglected. There is a complex interplay between religious affinity, caste hierarchy and economic force in the leather and tannery sector.

As a sector expert pointed out, the Central and State Government policies for the sector tend to be dominated by commercial interests. These put the commercial interests of exporters and tanneries in sharp relief neglecting the interests of the voiceless leather flayers and the leather workers. Caught in a triple grinding wheel of a strong and persistent social stigma due to their occupation, economic exploitation from the middlemen and economic stress due to incursion of synthetics, the leather flayers remain a neglected and emaciated lot.

It appears to me that the thickness of the skin worn by our polity and by our social leaders perhaps far exceeds the thickness of the buffalo hides with which the flayers and the leather workers deal.

Es ist nicht der einzige Fall von Sexismus, der Großbritanniens Politik derzeit beschäftigt. Umweltminister Michael Gove entschuldigte sich am Samstag für einen Witz über den Hollywood-Produzenten Harvey Weinstein, wie die britische Ausgabe der HuffPost berichtet.

Gove sagte in einer Radioshow, sich auf ein Interview mit dem Journalisten John Humphrys einzulassen, sei ""wie in Harvey Weinsteins Schlafzimmer zu gehen - man kann nur beten, dass die Würde intakt bleibt.""

Weinstein wird von dutzenden Frauen beschuldigt, sie sexuell belästigt oder vergewaltigt zu haben. Gove sprach von einem ""ungeschickten"" Versuch, einen Witz zu machen.

Arbeits- und Rentenminister Stephen Crabb wird vorgeworfen, einer 19-Jährigen ""explizite"" Nachrichten nach einem Vorstellungsgespräch geschickt zu haben.

May und Corbyn verlangen Maßnahmen

Als Reaktion auf die Vorwürfe schrieb Premierministerin Theresa May einen Brief an den Sprecher des Unterhauses, John Bercow. Darin heißt es, die derzeitigen Disziplinarmaßnahmen für Parlamentarier hätten nicht genügend ""Biss"".

Weiter schrieb May: Es sei ""wichtig, dass alle, die im Unterhaus arbeiten, anständig und fair behandelt werden - wie das an einem modernen Arbeitsplatz zu erwarten ist.""

Der Streaming-Dienst Netflix will die Polit-Serie ""House of Cards"" nach der sechsten Staffel einstellen

Zuvor waren Vorwürfe gegen Hauptdarsteller Kevin Spacey laut geworden

Der Streaming-Dienst Netflix hat angekündigt, die Erfolgsserie ""House of Cards"" nach der sechsten Staffel einzustellen.

Zuvor waren Vorwürfe gegen Hauptdarsteller Kevin Spacey bekannt geworden. Der Oscargewinner soll 1986 einen 14-Jährigen sexuell belästigt haben.

Netflix und die Produzenten von ""House of Cards"" teilten mit, sie seien ""tief beunruhigt"" von den Vorwürfen gegen Spacey. In einer gemeinsamen Mitteilung berichteten die Verantwortlichen, sie hätten die Enthüllungen um Spacey am Montag mit den Schauspielern und der Filmcrew besprochen. Spacey sei nicht auf dem Filmset gewesen.

Die Entscheidung, die Serie einzustellen, sei allerdings schon vor Monaten gefallen, sagte eine Person, die mit der Situation vertraut sei, der Nachrichtenagentur AP.

Spacey outete sich als schwul

Schauspieler Anthony Rapp hatte Spacey in einem Interview eines sexuellen Übergriffs beschuldigt. Er selbst sei bei den Vorgängen 14 Jahre alt gewesen, Spacey schon 26.

Spacey habe ihn im Jahr 1986 nach einer Party in seinem New Yorker Apartment auf sein Bett gelegt und sei auf ihn gestiegen, sagte der heute 46-jährige Rapp dem Magazin ""Buzzfeed News"". Er habe sich aus der Umklammerung ""herauswinden"" können und die Wohnung verlassen. Auf Twitter antwortete Spacey, er könne sich an den Vorfall ""ehrlich nicht erinnern"".

Spacey nahm die Vorwürfe zum Anlass, sich als schwul zu outen. ""Ich habe mein ganzes Leben über Männer geliebt und romantische Begegnungen mit ihnen gehabt, und jetzt entscheide ich mich dafür, als schwuler Mann zu leben"", schrieb der Oscarpreisträger in der Nacht zu Montag auf Twitter.

According to booking data from Expedia, while most Aussie travellers tend to book their end of year vacations before October, there are still one in five who leave it to the last 30 days.

Sound familiar?

Don't worry, we've got your back. Here are our hot tips to booking a last minute Christmas getaway without breaking the bank.

Book sooner rather than later

Looking at the 90 days before Christmas, Expedia's booking data reveals November is apparently the cheapest time to book, with six days before Christmas being the most expensive (strangely specific, but there you go).

""With Christmas so close, our advice is to book now. Whether it's getting home for Christmas or opting for a getaway over New Year's, the sooner you book the better you'll be in grabbing yourself a bargain,"" managing director of Expedia Australia and NZ, Michael Pearson, said.

""There are no surprises that demand during this period is high, which pushes flight and accommodation prices up.""

That speed is of the essence is a point also echoed by Wotif.com travel expert, Amanda Behre.

""If you want flexibility in terms of destination, flights, accommodation and price -- now is the time to get organised and lock in your Christmas getaway, with availability getting swept up fast in popular spots,"" she told HuffPost Australia.

And while it's risky to leave booking holidays until the last minute, Behre says it can sometimes pay off.

""Although waiting for a hot deal at the last minute is slightly riskier than booking in advance, it can often result in the reward and inner smugness of nabbing a good rate, even over key booking periods like Christmas,"" she said.

Fly back in mid-January

One of the best things about going on a holiday over the Christmas period is not having to take as much annual leave, thanks to the three public holiday days (Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day for those who don't know.)

However, this also coincides with people coming back to work in early January once their two-week trip is up. With demand comes price hikes, so you may actually be better off extending your stay and flying back a little later.

""There is often a mad rush for people to get back on the first couple of days in January,"" Pearson said.

""If you can, think about taking a few extra days holiday into January to not only feel extra refreshed, but come back when flights are cheaper.""

A longer holiday *and* a cheaper flight? It's a win/win.

Be flexible

When it comes to booking last minute, you have to be prepared to be a little more flexible in terms of travel dates and times.

""If you are open to it, consider flying on Christmas Day, when (generally) there will be less demand for travel, especially in comparison to Christmas Eve,"" Behre said.

Opt for a package

If you're looking at a resort-type holiday, opting for a package deal can dramatically reduce your costs.

""Bundled flights and accommodation packages can be a godsend during the peak period for those on a budget. Also check for packages that include activities to make your spending money go even further,"" Pearson said.

In fact, according to Behre, the savings could even pay for an entire night's stay.

""Combining flights and accommodation in a package offers you a special rate that's not available when booking hotel and flights separately,"" she said. ""Sometimes this can equate to the cost of one night's accommodation.""

Palawan in the Philippines is becoming a popular spot for Aussies.

Research your destination

Okay, so you know when and how to book, but now comes the exciting part: where to go?

While it depends on what sort of traveller you are, Pearson says the most popular type of holiday after the hectic holiday season is one in which you can truly unwind.

""After the busy Christmas period, a fly and flop holiday is perfect for this time of year,"" he told HuffPost Australia.

""Aussies are happy to fly for up to nine hours for a beach holiday so places like Fiji are perfect as are destinations across Australia -- it's hard to beat Australia during summer.""

Top places Aussies are spending their Christmas holidays^: Bali Singapore Fiji Phuket Auckland Kuala Lumpur Bangkok London Hong Kong Hawaii Tokyo ^Based on travel dates – 23rd December 2017 – 1st January 2018. Source: Expedia.

While hotspots like Bali and Fiji are bound to be popular year in, year out, both Pearson and Behre say there are underrated destinations that are well worth a visit.

""Holidaymakers are expected to be lapping up the Aussie tradition of Christmas by the beach once again this year. While we're seeing strong demand for the usual hot spots, there are still a few sneaky bargains on offer, busting the myth that peak period travel equates to inflated accommodation pricing,"" Behre said.

""​​We have crunched the numbers and, based on availability as well as the predicted value for money*, travellers should consider Port Macquarie, Broadbeach on the Gold Coast, and Cairns.""

For Pearson, it was all about the west coast.

""Perth is my hometown so I may be bias but I think Western Australia is a real Aussie gem,"" he said. ""In particular, Busselton, with its iconic 1.8km jetty as the focal point...it's an ideal gateway to the renowned Margaret River region.

""Outside of Australia, we're seeing some interesting destinations attract more attention, such as the Palawan in the Philippines, Kauai in Hawaii and Phu Quoc Island in Vietnam.""",Last Minute Christmas Getaways That Won't Cost You A Fortune,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/29/last-minute-christmas-getaways-that-wont-cost-you-a-fortune_a_23260078/

The electorate in Himachal Pradesh wear their loyalties not on their sleeves but on their heads. In other states, voters may prefer to maintain silence about their affiliation to a political party during the polls. But in this hill state, they pronounce their loyalty and support through their headgear.

""Donning caps has been a round-the-year tradition in the interiors of Himachal Pradesh where the winter spell is too long,"" Roshan Lal Manta, 75, a former state government employee, told IANS.

But now people, including government employees, are wearing it to extend their affiliation to a particular political party.

He said since 'Raja Saab', as Virbhadra Singh is popularly known due to his roots in the erstwhile princely state of Bushahr, started wearing the green flap cap, the BJP's Dhumal promoted the maroon one.

Manta, a former employee leader, said if the Congress is at the helm most of the employees start donning the green cap and if there is the BJP the maroon will be their first choice.

The BJP is garnering support on the social media through photos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi wearing the traditional Himachali 'topi'.

The photo of Modi wearing the maroon cap during the remembrance ceremony for the Holocaust victims in Israel in July is taking a political hue in this election.

""Prime Minister Modi made the Himachali cap the crown in Israel. Thank you, tweeted Anurag Thakur, the BJP Member of Parliament from Hamirpur and former BCCI president -- and Dhumal's son.

Of course, there is a war over the colour of caps.

In the run-up to the polls, a cap reflecting the other's political ideology infuriated Virbhadra Singh at an official function, but Prime Minister Modi maintained calm at another public function.

At a function in the state capital last month where Union Minister J.P. Nadda was also present, state Health Minister Kaul Singh welcomed Virbhadra Singh by donning a Himachali maroon flap cap and presenting a shawl, a common practice at all official functions.

Seeing the BJP's trademark colour, the infuriated Chief Minister removed it immediately and wore his own green flap cap that he was holding.

Contrary to this, Modi didn't lose his patience when he was offered a Congress 'ideology' cap by Virbhadra Singh at the foundation laying ceremony of a Rs 1,350 crore 750-bed hospital in Bilaspur town.

From the colour of passion maroon to the shade of envy green, Modi immediately changed the colour of his cap while addressing a public meeting just after the official function.

But it had more to do with political ideology than changing moods, remarked a political observer.

Elections to the 68-member Himachal Pradesh assembly will be held on November 9.

The votes would be counted on December 18, the day that will decide which ""riot of colour"" -- green or maroon -- will flutter again in the secretariat.","In Himachal, Green And Maroon Caps Determine Political Loyalty",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/30/in-himachal-green-and-maroon-caps-determine-political-loyalty_a_23260217/

NEW DELHI -- External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Foreign Minister of Afghanistan H.E. Salahuddin Rabbani and Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran H.E. Javad Zarif, through a joint video conference on Sunday, flagged off the first shipment of wheat from India to Afghanistan that would be transhipped through the Chabahar port in Iran.

The shipment is a part of commitment made by the Indian Government to supply 1.1 million tonnes of wheat for the people of Afghanistan on grant basis.

The three Foreign Ministers welcomed the fact that this is the first shipment that would be going to Afghanistan through the Chabahar port after a Trilateral Agreement on Establishment of International Transport and Transit Corridor was signed during the visit of the Indian Prime Minister to Iran in May 2016.

Six more wheat shipments will be sent to Afghanistan over the next few months. They also reaffirmed their commitment to continue their cooperation for the benefit and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan and the region.

The shipment of wheat is a landmark moment as it will pave the way for operationalisation of the Chabahar port as an alternate, reliable and robust connectivity for Afghanistan. It will open up new opportunities for trade and transit from and to Afghanistan and enhance trade and commerce between the three countries and the wider region.

Swaraj reiterated India's continued commitment to support reconstruction, capacity building and socio-economic development of Afghanistan, including under the framework of the New Development Partnership that she had jointly announced with Foreign Minister Rabbani last month during the meeting of India-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Council.

The External Affairs Minister also renewed the commitment to work closely with regional and international partners to bring peace, security, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan.",Sushma Swaraj Flags Off First Wheat Consignment To Afghanistan Through Chabahar Port,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/29/sushma-swaraj-flags-off-first-wheat-consignment-to-afghanistan-through-chabahar-port_a_23259613/

Mais, son style abrasif et pompeux, ses retournements imprévisibles, son ignorance des questions internationales les plus élémentaires, son manque de culture, son égo-manie et son manque de respect envers les autres (souvenons-nous comment il bouscula le premier ministre monténégrin pour être sur le devant de la photo au Sommet de l'OTAN), sa volonté maniaque de dominer ceux qu'il rencontre, nous font craindre autant les dommages diplomatiques à prévoir de cette visite que la présence du proverbial éléphant dans un magasin de porcelaines. Jetons un regard sur les boutiques où le pachyderme va entrer!

La Chine

Les Chinois aiment ce qui est prévisible, ils aiment opérer dans un environnement politique stable.

Il est évident que ce n'est pas ce que le président américain leur offre. De l'appel à la présidente de Taiwan, peu après son élection, au sommet Xi-Trump d'avril où les deux chefs ont semblé s'entendre (grâce à la Chine qui a eu la sagesse d'arriver avec des concessions commerciales susceptibles de plaire au président américain), aux soubresauts liés à la Corée du Nord où, tour à tour, M. Trump a fustigé les Chinois et leur a dit qu'il comptait sur eux pour infléchir Pyongyang, de son inscription de la Chine sur la liste noire des pays trafiquants les organes aux mamours téléphoniques avec le président chinois, aux menaces répétées de guerre commerciale, en passant par les félicitations offertes au président chinois pour son nouveau mandat à la tête du pays, l'administration américaine semble tout faire pour désorienter les dirigeants chinois. Les Chinois, qui auraient inventé la boussole il y a deux mille ans, doivent bien se demander ce qui les attend! Mais on peut compter sur la Chine, qui sait recevoir et qui a probablement saisi la personnalité de notre hurluberlu, pour lui en mettre plein la vue!

Les deux Corée

En validant la version chinoise quant à la nature des relations historiques de domination entre la Chine et la Corée, le même président américain, le printemps dernier avait réussi, par cette seule déclaration, à se mettre à dos à la fois la Corée du Nord et la Corée du Sud! Faut le faire! Cela, en plus de fournir des munitions au discours nationaliste chinois et asiatique selon lequel les États-Unis n'ont pas à s'impliquer dans les affaires du continent le plus vaste et le plus populeux et exigeant un retrait américain. Comment écrire « s'auto-pelure-de-bananiser » en 140 caractères ou moins?

En mai dernier, il se disait prêt à rencontrer Kim Jong-un, mais avant, comme depuis, a menacé son pays de destruction à de nombreuses reprises, y compris, fait sans précédent pour le chef d'une démocratie, à la tribune des Nations-Unies, organisation dédiée à la paix universelle!

Bref, dans le dossier coréen, le plus explosif dans la région, le président souffle le chaud et le froid et on ne sait jamais à quoi s'attendre.

Japon

Non seulement le président américain a-t-il annulé la signature de son pays au Partenariat Transpacifique, mais son obsession à ne regarder qu'à l'interne (America First) l'a amené, à plusieurs reprises, à déclarer que les Japonais et les Coréens devraient à l'avenir se défendre seuls, reniant ainsi plus de 60 années d'engagement américain envers ces démocraties. Outre le fait qu'il s'est depuis contredit en disant qu'il était à 100% avec le Japon face à la menace nord-coréenne, de tels revirements sont extrêmement déstabilisants pour les pays alliés et les pays « ennemis », car ils peuvent causer de grosses erreurs de calcul et provoquer des conflits qui auraient été évitables dans un environnement stable et prévisible.

Dans le pire scénario, le retrait du parapluie américain ne pourrait qu'amener le Japon et la Corée et de nombreux autres pays de la région à opérer un sauve-qui-peut diplomatique et à négocier les meilleurs termes possible avec la Chine.

Dans le pire scénario, le retrait du parapluie américain ne pourrait qu'amener le Japon et la Corée et de nombreux autres pays de la région à opérer un sauve-qui-peut diplomatique et à négocier les meilleurs termes possible avec la Chine. Du coup, les États-Unis perdraient toute influence diplomatique et économique dans la région, catapultant la Chine, sans qu'elle n'ait rien à faire, au rang de première puissance mondiale!

Le premier ministre japonais, fraîchement réélu sur un discours sans compromis face à la Corée du Nord, encouragera-t-il la nature belliqueuse de son interlocuteur américain? Cela ne reviendrait-il pas à offrir des allumettes à un pyromane?

Vietnam

Il sera curieux de voir ce qu'il dira aux Vietnamiens, hôtes du Sommet de l'APEC. Après un délicat rapprochement opéré depuis plusieurs années par George Bush et Barack Obama, que dira-t-il à ce pays lui aussi craintif face à la Chine? Aura-t-il la même insensibilité qu'envers la veuve d'un soldat américain tué au Niger, lorsqu'il faudra aborder les relations historiques entre les deux pays, marquées par l'effroyable Guerre du Vietnam? Leur dira-t-il à eux aussi que dans le fond, ils savaient dans quoi ils s'embarquaient?

Une visite écourtée?

On dit dans certains milieux américains que le président pourrait ne pas effectuer toute la tournée et rentrer plus tôt, car un long voyage le rendrait de mauvaise humeur et susceptible de faire des déclarations intempestives sur Twitter! Vraiment? Ce Sommet de l'ASEAN (Association des pays de l'Asie du Sud-Est) pourrait offrir au président l'occasion, par un discours ferme et nuancé, de rassurer les pays de la région et de mettre à mal les prétentions de souveraineté chinoise sur les eaux internationales les bordant. Mais, comme cette réunion aura lieu aux Philippines et que son hôte sera la brute primaire Rodrigo Duterte, un président qui encourage les meurtres extralégaux et en aurait lui-même commis, il serait normalement plus sage d'éviter une telle étape et de telles rencontres. Mais, ne comptons pas trop là-dessus, les deux hommes, qui partagent de nombreux traits de personnalité, risquent de bien s'entendre. Certes, l'absence du président américain, à cette dernière étape du périple, pourrait être insultante pour ceux qui l'avaient invité, d'autant plus que la date avait été fixée pour faciliter sa présence.

Mais, tout compte fait, les dommages d'une non-présence pourraient être moindres que s'il se rendait sur place.",L’éléphant Donald Trump dans le magasin de porcelaine,http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/patrice-dallaire/l-elephant-donald-trump-dans-le-magasin-de-porcelaine_a_23259309/

Verdú ha respondido de esta manera, en un encuentro con la prensa durante el rodaje de Ola de crímenes, nueva película de Gracia Querejeta, al ser preguntada por los recientes casos de acosos sexuales que están saliendo a la luz en el mundo del cine. La actriz se ha mostrado además de acuerdo con Querejeta en que deben ser las personas de alrededor las que ayuden a denunciar estas situaciones.

""Es tremendo, pero lo que es terrible también es el terror que se crea en torno a la denuncia del abuso. Es terrorífico, no solamente por el hecho, sino que además es un hecho conocido en muchas ocasiones por gente de alrededor y el miedo al despido, a que te dejen de lado o a que no te den trabajo te hace que te calles"", ha explicado la cineasta.

Querejeta ha puesto como ejemplo el caso de Harvey Weinstein y cómo alguien como Tarantino no se atrevió a decirlo. ""Lo terrible es que no se pueda confesar y que una víctima no lo cuente por miedo, pero los de alrededor que lo saben son los que tienen que potenciar la campaña para que seamos de una vez por todas de acabar con estas situaciones"", ha pedido Querejeta. El actor Antonio Resines, que también participa en la película, ha secundado esta petición con un escueto ""firmado"".

Ola de crímenes comenzó su rodaje el pasado 9 de octubre y se encuentra en el ecuador. Durante tres semanas el equipo ha estado desplazado en el País Vasco y en estos días se encuentra en Madrid para concluir previsiblemente a finales de este mes.

""Espero que Cifuentes no me regañe, pero como casi siempre suele suceder, cuando salimos fuera de Madrid nos reciben muy bien. No sé si es que aquí la gente ya está más cansada de los rodajes, pero fuera de la capital siempre hay una buena recepción y tenemos todo tipo de facilidades"", ha indicado.

El reparto de Ola de crímenes, una coproducción en la que participan Telecinco Cinema o Bowfinger —la productora de Santiago Segura—, entre otros, está encabezado por nombres como los de la propia Verdú, Paula Echevarría, Juana Acosta, Raúl Arévalo, Antonio Resines y el joven Aiser Rikarte.

LA COMEDIA DE CHASCARRILLO

El hijo adolescente de Leyre (Verdú), un ama de casa divorciada, mata a su padre en un arrebato. Ella decide hacer lo imposible por ocultarlo, desatando a su pesar una caótica ola de crímenes en la ciudad de Bilbao. Mientras, la nueva esposa del difunto trata de ocultar la jugosa trama de corrupción en la que se movían.

Querejeta ha calificado a este nuevo trabajo como ""comedia de intriga con un tratamiento serio"". ""No es una comedia de chascarrillo, lo digo sin desprecio, pero aquí hay una serie de personajes de verdad, bien construidos"", ha señalado la cineasta, tras recordar que la comedia ""no es un género ajeno"" a sus trabajos.

LOS HERMANOS COEN Y ALMODÓVAR

Asimismo, la directora vuelve a apostar por una película ""muy femenina"", donde las mujeres llevan el ""estandarte"" de la cinta. Sobre los referentes en los que ha trabajado antes del rodaje, Querejeta ha apuntado a similitudes con películas de los Coen.

""Para mí, una referencia podría ser Locas de alegría, con una mujer que se le va la cabeza pero luego parece que puede reaccionar"", ha completado Verdú, mientras que Juana Acosta apuesta por el parecido de las protagonistas con ""mujeres almodovarianas al límite"".","Maribel Verdú, sobre el acoso sexual: ""Esto se ha dado toda la vida, en el cine y fuera del cine""",http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/10/30/maribel-verdu-sobre-el-acoso-sexual-esto-se-ha-dado-toda-la-vida-en-el-cine-y-fuera-del-cine_a_23260930/

De la que muestra a una pareja heterosexual desnuda en la cama, que quiere ir más despacio. De la que habla de cómo el ex reaparece, después de ocho meses de luchar para dejar de pensar en él. De la que muestra cómo una mujer, tras escuchar los dictados sociales, termina siendo una hierba marchita.

Fue mientras veía una presentación de Isabel Pantoja por la tele —en febrero pasado— que abrió su fanpage en Facebook. Empezó invitando a sus cercanos a seguirla, ahora ha acumulado más de medio millón de seguidores que disfrutan sus ilustraciones sobre sexo, rollos mentales, lo más patético que a veces hacen las mujeres, lo penoso y los ex.

""Bruta nace a comienzos de este año, cuando noté que mis dibujos se estaban apoderando de mis redes sociales y pensé que era hora de agruparlos en un solo lugar, por sanidad mental. Nunca sospeché lo que pasaría más adelante"", explica.

Bruta tiene la vocación de empoderar a las mujeres, pero también la humildad suficiente como para creer que no es para tanto. ""Si a través de mis dibujos alguien se ha sentido motivado a dejar ciertas ataduras, MARAVILLOSO, pero tampoco es que eso se deba a mí"", dice.

Aunque cree que su trabajo podría animar a ciertas mujeres a cambiar, ""la semilla está en cada uno, esperando su momento para salir"".

La ilustradora chilena ha identificado que los temas que más likes y shares obtienen en redes sociales son generalmente aquellos que tratan sobre dejar ir relaciones que ya no son un aporte.

El feminismo también es de los que más reacciones tiene, aunque éste desemboca en la zona de los comentarios: ""Hablar abiertamente de él provocará mayor polémica y discusiones"", explica.

Y ni qué decir del alcance que consiguen los dibujos que muestran a una mujer resuelta ante un tema, aunque sólo sea sobre dejarse crecer el vello o reírse de sí misma: ""Ahí aparecen los moralistas o los que prefieren vernos inseguras, dependientes y sumisas"".

Ojalá todos fuésemos feministas y ojalá no tuviésemos que explicarlo.

Bruta confiesa que el feminismo la llevó ""a soltar prejuicios, culpas, a tener más confianza en cuanto a cómo vivo ciertas cosas y a raíz de eso lograr que cada vez me importe menos lo que los demás piensan o esperan de mí"".

No es fácil quitarse ideas con las que creciste y que gran parte de la sociedad en que te mueves sigue pensando/practicando.

Esta joven artista visual cree en la igualdad de hombres y mujeres. Y en que el machismo nos afecta a todos. ""Yo no odio ni me creo superior a los hombres"", dice. Y continúa: ""Eso es algo que el feminismo no busca y que sin embargo algunos le atribuyen sin siquiera hacer el intento de informarse"", explica mientras lamenta la ignorancia y el miedo de quienes no aceptan cambios en lo establecido.

Para ella los hombres son compañeros y el machismo debería formar parte del medioevo.

Para Bruta la soledad es aprendizaje; el sexo, conexión y el amor, grandeza.

Pero el drama, el drama es pura sabrosura.

En su regreso a Ciudad de México, a cinco años de su última visita, el exBeatle puso en práctica sus conocimientos de español para enviar palabras de ánimo al pueblo mexicano, durante un concierto en el que reunió a 48,300 personas, según cifras de la promotora.

Previo a la interpretación de ""Maybe I'm amazed"", el músico levantó el puño haciendo referencia a la señal que llamaba a la calma en la búsqueda de vidas dentro de las zonas de desastre, después del sismo de magnitud 7.1 que golpeó al centro del país el 19 de septiembre.

""¡Fuerza México!"", gritó el veterano rockero, mensaje que repitió en su clásico ""Let it be"" provocando el júbilo y la emoción de los miles de asistentes que acudieron al Azteca para ser testigos de la gira mundial ""One on One tour"".

Semanas antes de su llegada a la capital mexicana, Macca, como le llaman con cariño sus seguidores, manifestó su apoyo al país por los sismos del 7 y 19 de septiembre que dejaron más de 400 muertos y miles de damnificados en un mensaje que compartió en sus redes sociales.

""Hola, mis amigos mexicanos. Soy Paul McCartney y les deseo lo mejor a todos ustedes y les mando mi cariño y apoyo tras estos tiempos tan difíciles por los que han pasado recientemente"", escribió en Twitter.

El cantautor volvió al país después de la inolvidable experiencia que le dejó su presentación del 2012 en el Zócalo, la plaza principal de Ciudad de México, donde actuó ante unas 200.000 personas, cifra con la que batió su récord de 100.000 reunidas en la Plaza Roja de Moscú en 2003.

La gira ""One on One"" comenzó en Estados Unidos en 2016 y lo ha llevado a tocar 41 shows en 12 países diferentes, reuniendo a más de 1.2 millones de personas.

El repertorio elegido abarca toda su carrera, desde su primer trabajo con The Quarrymen hasta su más reciente colaboración con Kanye West y Rihanna, además de clásicos de The Beatles, Wings y temas de su catálogo en solitario.

Unas 40 canciones sonaron durante casi tres horas de concierto, desatando la emoción de las cuatro generaciones que se dieron cita en el recinto sureño.

CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne haben sich bei Bildung und Digitalisierung auf höhere Investitionen einigen können

Nach dem Streit in der vergangenen Woche haben die ""Jamaikaner"" zur konstruktiven Arbeit zurückgefunden - und können am Montagabend Ergebnisse vorlegen.

Die Einigung: CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne wollen in einer möglichen Jamaika-Koalition die Ausgaben für Bildung und Forschung deutlich steigern und die digitale Infrastruktur ausbauen.

Zum bisherigen Kooperationsverbot zwischen Bund und Ländern in der Bildung heißt es in einem am Montag in Berlin veröffentlichten Papier der Jamaika-Unterhändler lediglich: ""Über die Art und Weise der Zusammenarbeit zwischen Bund, Ländern und Kommunen muss noch gesprochen werden, insbesondere über die Frage des Kooperationsverbotes.""

So viel Geld wollen die Parteien ausgeben

Bis zum Jahr 2025 sollten für Bildung und Forschung mehr als zehn Prozent des Bruttoinlandsproduktes (BIP) aufgewendet werden, heißt es in dem Papier.

Zudem wollen die Parteien die Ausbildungsförderung Bafög modernisieren und mehr Studenten einen Anspruch eröffnen. Die Aufwendungen für Forschung und Entwicklung, die Nahtstelle zwischen Hochschulen und Wirtschaft, sollen auf 3,5 Prozent des BIP erhöht werden.

Für die Digitalisierung sei der Breitbandausbau wesentlich. Welche Technologie dazu genutzt werde - etwa Glasfaser - sei noch zu erörtern, machte CDU-Generalsekretär Peter Tauber deutlich.

Zudem sollen möglichst schnell Funklöcher auf dem Land geschlossen werden. Wo dieses Themenfeld angesiedelt werden soll - als selbstständiges Ministerium, bei Bildung und Forschung oder bei der Wirtschaft - sei offen, sagte Tauber.

""Jamaika könnte das Bündnis der digitalen Chancen sein""

Bei der Digitalisierung gehe es auch um den Ausbau der Datensicherheit, sagte FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer. Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner sagte: ""Jamaika könnte ... könnte das Bündnis der digitalen Chancen sein.""

Wie Beer hob er hervor, dass sich die Unterhändler klar zu einem modernen Datenrecht bekannt hätten - unter Wahrung der Bürgerrechte. Der auslaufende Hochschulpakt zwischen Bund und Ländern zur Bewältigung der hohen Studierendenzahlen solle verlängert werden.

Alle vier hoben hervor, dass sich die Arbeitsatmosphäre wesentlich verbessert habe. Kellner sagte, der Pulverdampf der vergangenen Woche sei wohl mit dem Wind vom Wochenende verflogen. Er sprach von einer ""sehr guten Arbeitsatmosphäre"".

Auch bei weiteren Themenblöcken bestehen Einigungen

Auch bei der Pflege haben sich die Parteien geeinigt: der Pflegebereich soll gestärkt werden. Dazu seien mehr Personal und bessere Ausstattung notwendig, sagte Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner am Montag in Berlin. Darüber hinaus seien für die Grünen die Beitragsparität bei den Beiträgen für die gesetzliche Krankenversicherung wichtig.

Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Bund und Ländern im Kampf gegen Terrorismus wollen Union, FDP und Grüne verbessern. Dabei solle die Koordinierungsfunktion von Bundeskriminalamt und Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV) stärker als bisher wahrgenommen werden, heißt es in einem Leitlinien-Papier zum Bereich Innen, Sicherheit und Rechtsstaat.

Der Einsatz von Videoüberwachung solle an Kriminalitätsschwerpunkten, an besonders gefährlichen Orten, Einrichtungen und bei Veranstaltungen gegebenenfalls auch befristet angeordnet werden können, heißt es weiter. Zudem sei die Cybersicherheit für die Zukunft Deutschlands von herausragender Bedeutung.

""Es ist in einer Nacht nicht leichter geworden""

Nach dem Geheimtreffen der Parteichefs vom Sonntagabend waren die Jamaika-Unterhändler in der Tat bemüht, die aufgeheizte Stimmung abzukühlen.

CSU-Parteichef Horst Seehofer sagte vor Beginn der Sondierungen am Montag, die Runde der Vorsitzenden habe der Atmosphäre gut getan. ""Aber es ist jetzt nicht in einer Nacht leichter geworden. Einfach von der Sache her.""

Neben Bildung und Digitales standen auch die Themenbereiche Arbeit, Rente sowie Inneres und Recht auf dem Programm. Am Nachmittag kam der mehr als 50 Mitglieder große Kreis der Unterhändler zusammen, um eine Zwischenbilanz zu ziehen.

Bereits am Donnerstag wollen sie sich erneut an die Themen Migration und Klimaschutz machen, die in der vergangenen Woche zu massivem Streit geführt hatten und vertagt worden waren.

In der Zuwanderungspolitik ist der Familiennachzug für Flüchtlinge einer der Knackpunkte. Beim Klimaschutz gab es vergangene Woche Krach darüber, wie die nationalen und internationalen Ziele zur Treibhausgas-Minderung erreicht werden sollen.

A lawyer representing the families alleged on Monday that staff at St. Joseph's West 5th Campus and St. Joseph's Charlton Campus knew that the men — Brandon Taylor, 29, and Joel Verge, 42 — were at risk of trying to commit suicide and had been instructed to supervise them.

""Hospitals are supposed to be safe havens for people in crisis,'' Michael Smitiuch told a news conference. ""Loved ones should be comfortable knowing that when their loved one is under constant or direct supervision that they're safe.''

Each family is suing St. Joseph's Health System for $8.5 million in damages.

In their statements of claim filed in court late last Friday, the families say the hospitals didn't provide adequate supervision to the men, who they allege were left alone for periods of time with items they used in their suicides.

""They provided, frankly, the very means to allow them to take their own lives,'' Smitiuch alleged.

""Had the hospitals simply done the job they were supposed to do, they wouldn't have died when they did or the way they did.''

Taylor was admitted to St. Joseph's West 5th Campus in August 2016 after an overdose believed to be a suicide attempt, and was supposed to be checked on every 15 minutes, the statement of claim said.

They provided, frankly, the very means to allow them to take their own lives. Michael Smitiuch

His mother had called the hospital on Aug. 18 to say she was worried about Taylor, and to warn them that her son was smart and could be deceptive, it said.

Taylor was able to keep his cellphone with him, which was used to Google suicide methods leading up to his death, the statement said.

Within hours of his mother's call, Taylor was found unresponsive in his room and a day later, he was taken off life support.

Verge, 42, was admitted to hospital in November 2016 and the lawsuit alleges he was supposed to be under constant supervision following a previous attempt to commit suicide.

But Smitiuch alleged that Verge, too, was left alone long enough to kill himself.

The allegations have not been proven in court and St. Joseph's has not yet filed a statement of defence.

Nine suicides in 2016

The pair is among nine people who killed themselves in 2016 while being treated as in-patients, out-patients and while on day passes at St. Joseph's Health System's local division, according to an external review released in July 2017. Smitiuch said two more have died by suicide since January.

The allegations contained in the statements of claim have not been proven in court and St. Joseph's has not yet filed a statement of defence.

David Higgins, president of the local division of St. Joseph's Health System, said the hospital has already implemented many recommendations made in the external review, and it is committed to completing the rest.

""We are deeply saddened by the pain and loss suffered by the families of Joel Verge and Brandon Taylor, Higgins said in a written statement. ''Suicide is a tragedy and is profoundly distressing for all of those who are touched by it.""

He declined to comments on the specific allegations made in the lawsuits.

Fiancee has trouble sleeping

Taylor's fiancee, Jennifer Smyth, said nothing has been the same since her partner's death. They'd been together for almost a decade and were planning to marry in 2017.

""I've had trouble sleeping and I wake up with nightmares,'' she said. ""Either it's a good memory and you realize it was just a memory and you're upset, or you dream about something upsetting. Either way, you just wake up upset.''

Verge's dad, Carl Verge, also said his son's death has been very hard on the family.

""It's something you know is never going to go away,'' he said.

Deutschland hat gewählt und noch steht die Frage im Raum: Wer regiert künftig? Die nächsten Wochen und Monate werden voraussichtlich von einer langwierigen Regierungsbildung geprägt sein, mit der eine politische Ungewissheit einhergeht.

Unabhängig davon, ob sich eine Jamaika-Koalition bildet, doch eine große Koalition entsteht oder sogar Neuwahlen anstehen - die zukünftige Regierung übernimmt eine große Verantwortung in Zeiten des Wandels und der wirtschaftlichen Herausforderungen. Mit Blick auf die Zukunft Deutschlands als wirtschaftlicher Vorreiter muss das neue Kabinett nun mit klaren Forderungen in die Pflicht genommen werden.

Denn eines ist sicher: Wer die wirtschaftliche Zukunft Deutschlands sichern will, der muss in die Zukunft des Mittelstands und auch des Einzelhandels investieren. Ohne einen klaren politischen Fokus auf die Herausforderungen und Bedürfnisse des Handels werden wir in den nächsten Jahren ein Massensterben von kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen erleben.

Angesichts der volkswirtschaftlichen Bedeutung des Mittelstands und seiner zentralen Rolle in der Ausbildung von Fachkräften ist das bisherige Engagement der politischen Parteien nicht ausreichend und, vor allem, nicht zukunftsorientiert.

Insbesondere in Bezug auf die digitale Transformation muss ein Umdenken stattfinden, wenn Deutschland seinen Status als Spitzenwirtschaftsnation nicht gefährden will. In den Bereichen Qualifizierung von Arbeitskräften, Datenschutz und -sicherheit, digitale Infrastrukturen und Innovationsmanagement sind grundlegende Maßnahmen notwendig, um international wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben.

Die neue Bundesregierung muss die Chance nutzen, aus den Versäumnissen der Vergangenheit zu lernen und sich endlich den Herausforderungen des Einzelhandels zu stellen.

Qualifizierung forcieren

Um für die Zukunft gut aufgestellt zu sein und einem Fachkräftemangel entgegenzuwirken muss die Nachwuchsförderung ganz oben auf der politischen Agenda stehen - insbesondere in Bezug auf die Digitalisierung.

Denn für alle Unternehmen gilt: Die Berufsbilder und Kompetenzen, die mit der digitalen Transformation etwa in den Bereichen IT und Datensicherheit aufkommen, werden immer wichtiger. Auf der einen Seite ist eine verstärkte Förderung von betrieblich integriertem Wissenstransfer notwendig, um Fachpersonal nachhaltig zu binden.

Auf der anderen Seite muss die digitale Kompetenz des Lehrpersonals ausgebaut werden, um mit Blick auf die nachfolgenden Generationen international wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben.

Ausbau der digitalen Infrastruktur

Im Bereich der digitalen Anbindung hinkt Deutschland - einstiger Vorreiter im Bereich der Infrastruktur - weit hinterher. Eine umfassende und flächendeckende digitale Infrastruktur ist jedoch die Basis für die Förderung von Fachkräften, für Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Innovation.

Die gerade diskutierte Breitbandversorgung mit 50 Mbit/s, kann nur ein Etappenziel darstellen und muss langfristig einer flächendeckenden Versorgung mit 100 Mbit/s und mehr weichen. Der Ausbau des Glasfasernetzes muss daher dringend beschleunigt und die Voraussetzungen für funkbasierte Netze geschaffen werden.

Gerade der ländliche Raum, Sitz zahlreicher Mittelständler und Handelsunternehmen, muss hierbei Vorrang haben.

Vor dem Hintergrund der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit des Handels muss die Politik zudem die Rahmenbedingungen dafür schaffen, dass sich der Handel in Verbundgruppen digital zusammenschließen und professionalisieren kann.

Dazu gehört beispielsweise der gemeinsame Zugriff auf Kundendaten, der durch die sogenannte EPrivacy-Verordnung verhindert wird. Nur durch eine zentrale Distributions- und Preispolitik kann der Handel zukunftsfest bleiben.

Klare Vorgaben bei der Datensicherheit

Gleichzeitig müssen von der Politik endlich klare und praxisorientierte Regelungen für das Thema Datenschutz und -sicherheit vorgelegt werden. Die aktuellen Vorgaben sind oft überregulierend, extrem komplex und stellen besonders kleine Unternehmen vor große Herausforderungen, die einem fairen Wettbewerb mit Großunternehmen entgegenstehen.

Die Politik muss daher schnellstmöglich einen übersichtlichen und leicht umsetzbaren Handlungsrahmen entwickeln, der sowohl Rechtssicherheit und Schutz vor Cyberkriminalität gewährleistet als auch kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen einen gewissen rechtssicheren Spielraum bei der Nutzung von Daten lässt.

Innovationskraft fordern und fördern

Die Politik muss zudem durch die Forderung und Förderung von Innovationskraft Anreize für den Mittelstand schaffen, selbst zu forschen und zu entwickeln.

Es muss ein Bewusstsein für die Notwendigkeit aber auch Attraktivität von unternehmensinternen Future Labs geschaffen werden. Das Ziel ist ein innovativer deutscher Mittelstand, auch in forschungsarmen Branchen wie dem Handel.

Die Politik muss handeln

Kleine und mittlere Unternehmen erwirtschaften über ein Drittel des gesamten Umsatzes aller deutschen Unternehmen. Sie beschäftigen mehr als die Hälfte aller sozialversicherungspflichtigen Beschäftigten - mehr als 16 Millionen. Und: Mittelständische Betriebe sind verantwortlich für mehr als 80% aller Auszubildenden in Deutschland.

Die Aussage, der Mittelstand sei Deutschlands Zukunft, ist daher keine Leerformel sondern ein volkswirtschaftlicher Fakt.

Die zukünftigen politischen Entscheidungsträger müssen die Bedürfnisse des Mittelstandes ernst nehmen und eine gezielte Politik für den Mittelstand vor dem Hintergrund der digitalen Transformation betreiben.

Dazu gehört auch eine Antwort auf die Frage, wie man gegen den Mehrwertsteuerbetrug durch global agierende Internetplattformen vorgehen will, der den Wettbewerb zu Lasten des heimischen Mittelstands verzerrt. Die Politik muss handeln.

Über Günter Althaus:

Als Präsident des Mittelstandsverbundes ZGV und als Vorstandsvorsitzender der ANWR Group vertritt Günter Althaus die Interessen von tausenden kleineren und mittleren Unternehmen in Deutschland. Die Digitalisierung versteht er als essentiellen Schritt in die Zukunft, denn sie verändert rasant alle Geschäftsmodelle und die gesamte Arbeitswelt. Für kleinere und mittlere Unternehmen, die mit dieser Herausforderung am stärksten kämpfen, sieht er die besten Chancen in gemeinschaftlichen Aktivitäten und einer konkreten Zielsetzung. Günter Althaus ist außerdem Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender der DZB Bank und der AKTIVBANK und Mitglied im Präsidium des Handelsverbandes HDE.

If Congress politician Rahul Gandhi had a coin for every time he was asked when he planned to get married, he would not have to worry about change for the rest of his life. Yesterday too, at the PHD Chamber of Commerce, 47-year-old Gandhi was asked this question by none other than boxer Vijender Singh, whose wedding the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty had attended.

""My wife and I want to know when Rahul bhaiyya will get married,"" the boxer apparently asked Gandhi, according to The Hindu.

After an initial attempt to brush off the question, Gandhi said: ""I leave it to destiny. Jab hogi, tab hogi (if it has to happen, it will).""

The conversation soon turned to why politicians do not take part in sports. To which, Gandhi had a surprising revelation about himself. He is a black belt in the Japanese martial art form of Aikido.

Eine Unterwasserfotografin hat nun bedrückende Aufnahmen von großen Mengen Abfall in der karibischen See veröffentlicht

Die Aufnahmen, die uns eine Lehre sein sollten, seht ihr oben im Video

Es ist übel: Jedes Jahr landen rund neun Millionen Tonnen Kunststoffabfälle in den Ozeanen unserer Erde. Das geht aus einem Bericht der Umweltorganisation Oceancare hervor.

Der Plastikmüll zersetzt sich nicht, wie etwa zum Beispiel Lebensmittelabfälle. Das hat für Mensch und Tier drastische Folgen.

Treibendes Plastik wird für viele Meerestiere zur tödlichen Falle. Sie verfangen sich in den Kunststoffteilen und werden so zum Beispiel langsam erdrosselt. Größere Plastikteile zerfallen unter Einwirkung von Sonnenstrahlen und Salzwasser zu Mikropartikeln. Diese schadstoffreichen Mikropartikel werden von Meerestieren verschluckt. Über die marine Nahrungskette gelangen sie so sogar bis zu uns Menschen.

Viele Tiere verenden grausam

Einige Tiere verenden, weil sie größere Plastikteile verschlucken. So fallen laut Oceancare hunderttausende Delphine, Wale und Robben dem Plastikmüll zum Opfer. Die Zahl der toten Seevögel gehe laut der Organisation in die Millionen.

Das Ausmaß des Dramas zeigen nun auch Fotos, die in der Karibik entstanden sind. Die Fotografin Caroline Power war auf einem Tauch-Trip nahe der Insel Roatan in Honduras unterwegs. Doch anstatt der blauen See sah sie dort einen acht Kilometer langen Teppich von Plastikmüll, der auf der Meeresoberfläche schwamm.

Jeder kann seinen Beitrag dazu leisten, das Problem zu lösen

Die Unterwasserfotografin war von dem Anblick entsetzt und postete die Fotos auf Facebook. Dazu schrieb sie: “Es ist bestürzend, mit anzusehen, wie das Meer durch menschlichen Abfall langsam erstickt.“

Dem “Telegraph“ sagte sie: “Es macht mich unglaublich traurig, sehen zu müssen, wie so ein schöner Teil unseres Planeten so sinnlos zerstört wird.“

Plastik ist aus unserem Alltag zwar kaum mehr wegzudenken, der Plastikverbrauch lässt sich jedoch leicht reduzieren. Jeder kann einen Teil dazu beitragen, indem er zum Beispiel auf Plastiktüten oder Plastikbesteck verzichtet. Es liegt an uns Menschen dafür zu sorgen, dass diese Bilder bald der Vergangenheit angehören.

At 3.30pm, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom is expected to have to answer an Urgent Question on the issue from Tory backbencher Anna Soubry.

In her own letter to Speaker Bercow last night, Theresa May called for current voluntary grievance procedures for Westminster staff to be made compulsory, and suggested a new independent mediation service for any staff with complaints. Both the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) and the Commons itself are under pressure to act. Former sleaze watchdog Sir Alastair Graham told Westminster Hour that tougher disciplinary rules, not mediation, was needed.

But what about the parties themselves? The Times and GuidoFawkes have lists circulating of at least 36 Tory MPs known to be “inappropriate” with women, and men. All of the stories, and more, are likely to be in the Whips’ ‘black book’ (also known as the ‘dirt book’), a list of secrets that can be used to get MPs to vote the right way. No10 denied last night that the PM was given regular updates on the sexual antics of her MPs, but no one denies the whips’ black book exists.

Former whip and now health minister Philip Dunne yesterday put his finger on the attitudes that still exist, letting slip to SkyNews’s Niall Paterson: “When I was in the Whip’s office, it was very clear that anything in the Whip’s office stays in the Whip’s office”. Sensing the jokey tone had misfired, Dunne hastily contradicted himself, adding that of course any ‘illegal’ behaviour was acted upon, but the lingering impression was of a self-regulating boys’ club relying on nudges and winks and a private code of conduct. Ex-No10 comms chief Katie Perrior told BBC Breakfast that the black book content was used to tell MPs “you will vote in a certain way - or we will tell your wife exactly what we’ve been up to.” That’s a reminder that House of Cards was originally a British drama long before it was a glitzy American Netflix series (speaking of which, Kevin Spacey has sparked a separate backlash on his own sexual advances).

Soubry was on the Today programme suggesting that May was exactly the right PM to finally get a grip on this. “There is a problem and we are all responsible for sorting it out. Theresa May, because she is a woman leader of a party, absolutely will – I’m confident of that.” Labour’s Lucy Powell pointed out that like the film industry, the Commons is “an environment where you have many, many, many people desperate to work in a place” who rely on others for work. “That’s what it is, it’s about a power inequality.” The question is whether there is enough evidence to force the sacking of ministers or resignation of MPs. Will anyone want to go public and name more names?

On Thursday, the Commons will debate a backbench motion on sexual harassment and violence in schools, tabled by the chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller and Labour’s Jess Phillips. Westminster is often depicted as one big public school. Today, and this week, it has a chance to prove that it really isn’t.","The Waugh Zone Monday October 30, 2017",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-waugh-zone-monday-october-30-2017_uk_59f6f091e4b07fdc5fbf2a53?4w&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

SÉCURITÉ ROUTIÈRE - Le premier passage piétons en trois dimensions en France est en test à Cysoing dans le Nord, pour inciter les voitures à ralentir près d'une école, un aménagement qui existe déjà en Inde, en Islande et en Belgique, notamment.

""C'est un moyen d'interpeller les automobilistes, surtout qu'on se rend compte qu'ils ne sont pas toujours civiques avec les piétons"", explique le maire, Benjamin Dumortier, qui en a eu l'initiative.

""On l'a mis à un endroit stratégique, à côté d'une école maternelle"", souligne l'élu, qui pourrait généraliser l'aménagement dans les zones à 30km/h de cette ville de 5000 habitants.

Les automobilistes s'arrêteront-ils plus souvent ? ""Certes, cela reste de la responsabilité des automobilistes"", reconnaît l'élu, qui se félicite néanmoins que l'on ""reparle de sécurité"" grâce à ce projet. Selon lui, là où la vitesse est plus élevée, les conducteurs risqueraient de piler, surpris par l'impression visuelle d'un obstacle.

Pour l'entreprise de signalisation routière, cet effet de relief créé par l'association de couleurs différentes et des lignes de fuite dessinant des ombres, comme pour un trompe-l'oeil, devrait responsabiliser les conducteurs et les piétons.

""On voit les choses différemment. Ca crée un effet d'optique sans les nuisances sonores d'un dos-d'âne, et c'est moins coercitif"", avance le directeur général de T1, du groupe Hélios, Éric Vandoolaeghe.

A la demande des élus, il a développé le motif en quelques jours. ""Nous trouvions le principe amusant et voulions être hors des clous"", ajoute-t-il. Selon lui, ces passages piétons, deux fois plus chers qu'un marquage au sol classique, ""vont fleurir un peu partout"".

zu Potte?

Die Deutschen haben einen neuen Bundestag gewählt. Er steuert wohl auf eine 4-Parteien-, eine schwarz-grün-gelbe, die sog. Jamaika-Koalition und -Regierung zu. Auf diese warten eine Fülle von Aufgaben und großen Herausforderungen, die sie für die Deutschen bewältigen sollen, Baustellen, die sie erfolgreich beackern müssen - das ist ihr demokratischer Auftrag von den Wählern.

Kommt die Jamaika-Koalition nun endlich zu ihrem Potte oder nicht?

In seiner Sprache hat ein Volk seine Weisheit und Lebenserfahrung zum Ausdruck gebracht. Was bedeutet dieser seltsame Ausdruck: „zu Potte kommen"", der in meinem letzten Blog („Nach der Wahl: Der trübe Start des deutschen Jamaika-Zirkus' und die ersten Jamaika-Witze"") etliche Male vorkommt?

Was ist des Pudels Kern?

„Zu Potte kommen"" ist eine alte deutsche Redewendung. Sie drückt aus kurz und knapp, als Bild: die anstehende, schwierige Aufgabe wurde bewältigt, erfolgreich erledigt, zu Ende gebracht, das gewünschte Ziel wurde erreicht.

Einige Beispiele

Wenn Sie den richtigen Partner gesucht und gefunden haben, dann sind Sie, kurz und knapp und mit nur 15 Zeichen „zu Potte kommen"". Haben Sie eine passende Wohnung gefunden, sind Sie auch zu Ihrem Potte gekommen. Oder haben Sie den gewünschten Job bekommen, sind Sie zu Potte gekommen. Haben Sie die Kreuzfahrt-Traum-Reise ihres Lebens angetreten, so sind sie im wahrsten Sinne auf dem Pott angekommen Und wenn die neue 3-Farben-Koalition die anstehenden schwierigen Aufgaben für das Land anpackt und erfolgreich löst, kommt sie zu Potte. Finden Sie jedoch nicht den richtigen Partner, die passende Wohnung, den gewünschten Shop oder Ihre Traumreise, sind Sie „nicht zu Potte"" gekommen. Und wenn die kommende Jamaika-Koalition die drängenden Aufgaben nicht löst, kommt sie „nicht zu Potte"".

Woher kommt diese seltsame Redewendung?

In Norddeutschland, auch in Dänemark, war und ist Pott der Ausdruck für Topf, für einen Behälter. Im übertragenen Sinn auch ein Behälter für Waren und Personen, ein Schiff oder auch eine Kneipe oder einen Farbeimer. Wer zu Potte kam, hat den richtigen Behälter für sich gefunden, fährt im richtigen Schiff und hat erfolgreich seine Aufgabe erfüllt.

Eine andere Bedeutung

Die Umgangssprache drückt sich nicht nur diskret, fein und vornehm, sondern zuweilen auch realistisch, drastisch und derb aus. Pott wird nicht nur für Topf benutzt, sondern auch für den „Boddschamber"", „das „Nachtgeschirr"" oder den Nachttopf. „Zu Topp kommen"" bedeutet in diesem Kontext in allzu menschlicher Bedrängnis ein hygienisches Verhalten: das ersehnte Ziel, den Nachttopf, erfolgreich zu erreichen. Und es schildert diskret den umgekehrten Vorfall, z.B. beim „flotten Otto"" das drängende und drückende Ziel nicht zu erreichen, zu verfehlen und damit nicht zu Potte zu kommen...

Ganz demokratisch und drastisch drückt aus „Die Koalition kommt nicht zu Potte"", dass sie die anstehenden dringenden Geschäfte nicht rechtzeitig und nicht richtig erfüllt, sie ihren eigentlichen Job verfehlt.

Fazit und Ankündigung

Eine Koalition, wie die Jamaika-Koalition in Berlin, die viele Aufgaben für das Land zu lösen hat, aber nicht aus der Knete, nicht aus den warmen Puschen kommt und nicht den Hintern hochkriegt, gibt damit Anlass für ein großes öffentliches demokratisches Gelächter. Dieses Verhalten löst neben öffentlichen Ärger aus auch ein Feuerwerk neuer Koalitions-Witze aus (folgen in weiteren Blogs).

Wer nach Mahnung eins noch immer nicht sein Buch in die Bücherei zurück trägt, erhält weitere Mahnungen. Und damit wird es immer teurer. Mit der dritten und vierten Mahnung müssen die Studenten in München und Nürnberg 25 Euro bzw. 35,50 Euro zahlen. Mit den zehn Euro aus der zweiten Mahnung kommen so am Ende 78 Euro zustande. Nicht schlecht - dürften die meisten Bücher im Verkaufspreis doch deutlich darunter liegen.

Einziger Wermutstropfen: An besagten Hochschulen ist es egal, ob man ein oder 10 Bücher entliehen hat. In Frankfurt ist das anders: Hier kostet die erste Mahnung zwar nur drei Euro. Allerdings auch für jedes entliehene Medium. Wer also drei Bücher bei sich hortet, zahlt bereits neun Euro.

An Hamburg und Dresdens Universitätsbibliotheken kommen vergessliche Studenten übrigens am günstigsten weg. Nur einen Euro wollen die Bibliothekare hier pro Buch mit der ersten Mahnung.

Ein ganz eigenes System der Säumnisgebühren hat die Universitätsbibliothek in Leipzig. Hier werden einfach 50 Cent pro Tag verlangt, ab dem 10. Tag einen Euro. Nicht mehr jedoch als 25 Euro insgesamt. Dabei bietet Leipzig neben dieser speziellen Regelung auch noch eine Bibliothek, die 24 Stunden geöffnet ist. Ganz fleißige Studenten können hier sogar an Weihnachten und Silvester lernen, der ""Gute Rutsch"" kann dann wohl nur geflüstert werden.

Und in Berlin? Hier gibt es allein zwischen den drei Unis große Unterschiede. Die FU Berlin mag mit der ersten Mahnung 1,50 Euro haben, die HU und die TU bereits 2 Euro. Zweite Mahnung: Vier Euro an der FU, fünf Euro an den beiden anderen. Am günstigsten kommen Studenten an der TU weg, wenn die dritte Mahnung zur Türe hinein fliegt: acht Euro. FU, 11,50 und HU, 13 Euro sind da deutlich teurer.

Egal ob günstig oder teuer: Mahngebühren sind immer Kosten, die man sich sparen sollte. Wer also noch ein Buch bei sich rumliegen hat: Ab damit in die Bib. Mit jedem weiteren Tag wird die ohnehin schmale Börse noch weiter unnötig belastet.

Offiziell führt jetzt Madrid die Amtsgeschäfte in Katalonien

Nun besteht Hoffnung auf Versöhnung - aber auch ein Boykott der Staatsbediensteten droht

Die separatistische Regierung Kataloniens ist entmachtet. Auf dem Papier zumindest.

Die spanische Zentralregierung stellte die Region im Nordosten des EU-Landes unter Zwangsverwaltung. Das Hauptziel Madrids sind Neuwahlen am 21. Dezember.

Doch wie es in der autonomen Region weitergeht, ist ungewiss. Was wird beziehungsweise kann nun in den nächsten Tagen und Wochen bis zum Urnengang passieren?

10 Fragen und Antworten im Überblick:

1. Wie läuft die Übernahme der Amtsgeschäfte durch Madrid genau ab?

Nach der Veröffentlichung der Absetzung der Regionalregierung von Carles Puigdemont am Samstag im spanischen Amtsblatt ist der Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy auch Regionalpräsident Kataloniens.

In der Praxis übernimmt seine Vizechefin, Soraya Saénz de Santamaría die Amtsgeschäfte. Die Staatssekretäre in den Madrider Ministerien übernehmen die Leitung der jeweiligen Regional-Ressorts. Ob und wie viele Politiker und Beamte im Rahmen der Übernahme von Madrid nach Barcelona versetzt werden, war vorerst noch unbekannt.

2. Ist seitens der abgesetzten Regionalregierung Widerstand zu erwarten?

Puigdemont hat die Unabhängigkeitsbefürworter am Samstag zum friedlichen ""demokratischen"" Widerstand aufgerufen. Sein bisheriger Vize, Oriol Junqueras, der nicht Puigdemonts liberaler Partei PDECat, sondern der linken ERC angehört, schrieb in der Zeitung ""El Punt Avui"", für alle Separatisten bleibe die Regionalregierung im Amt.

Physischer Widerstand ist von den Politikern allerdings nicht zu erwarten. Medien schrieben unter Berufung auf Sprecher der Separatisten sogar, viele der Minister in Barcelona bereiteten sich schon auf eine ""Schlüssel- und Büroübergabe"" am Montag vor.

3. Könnte Madrid bei der Übernahme der Amtsgeschäfte dennoch auf Schwierigkeiten stoßen?

Ja. Die katalanische Regionalregierung hat in Barcelona knapp 110.000 Beamte sowie rund 90.000 Angestellte und Praktikanten, von denen sehr viele überzeugte Separatisten sind. Dem sogenannten ""Verband der Gemeinden für die Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens"" (AMI) gehören zudem 787 aller 948 Bürgermeister an. Beobachter rechnen mit Boykottaktionen.

Die Schriftstellerin und Journalistin Esther Jaén, die sich als Katalanin in der Region sehr gut auskennt, warnte vor einem ""absoluten Desaster"" bei der Vorbereitung der Neuwahlen. Madrid drohte Widerständlern mit der Entlassung.

4. Was passiert unterdessen bei der Polizei? Und mit der Justiz?

Die beiden Chefs der katalanischen Polizeieinheit Mossos d'Esquadra, Pere Soler und Josep Lluís Trapero, wurden abgesetzt und nahmen ihren Hut bereits widerstandslos. Die ""Mossos"" (Jungs) werden jetzt nach Medieneinschätzung den von Madrid eingesetzten neuen Chefs folgen, da bei der Polizei das Gehorsamsgebot gelte.

Im Bereich der Justiz - anders als mit der katalanischen Polizei - war Madrid in Katalonien nie auf Probleme gestoßen. Die katalanische Justiz entschied zuletzt mehrfach gegen die Separatisten.

5. Und was ist mit den Hunderttausenden Anhängern der Unabhängigkeits-Bewegung?

Es gibt Beobachter und Organisationen, die vor Unruhen in den kommenden Wochen warnen. Am Wochenende gab es aber wider Erwarten vorerst nicht eine einzige Protestkundgebung der Separatisten. Diese haben bisher auch zu keiner Demonstration aufgerufen. Es ist aber davon auszugehen, dass die Befürworter einer Spaltung von Spanien wieder auf die Straße gehen werden.

6. Sollte man von der Planung einer Urlaubsreise nach Barcelona lieber absehen?

Nicht unbedingt. Das Auswärtige Amt hatte Spanien-Reisende wegen des Konflikts vor einigen Wochen bereits zur Achtsamkeit aufgerufen. Aber selbst nach der Eskalation des Konflikts gab es bei großen Kundgebungen allenfalls nur kleinere Ausschreitungen.

7. Welche Folgen hat das alles für die Politiker in Katalonien?

Im Prinzip keine Größeren. Obgleich alle abgesetzten Minister ab sofort keine Leibwächter mehr haben. Alle Abgeordneten bekommen aber bis zur Konstituierung des neuen Regionalparlaments ihre Bezüge weiter ausgezahlt. Überwiesen wird das Geld aus Madrid, da Rajoy unter anderem auch die Kontrolle über die Finanzbehörden der Region übernommen hat.

8. Gibt es Konsequenzen für die Menschen?

Auf den Straßen wird sich wenig ändern. Das Zusammenleben war im Zuge der Eskalation des Konflikts in den vergangenen Wochen in Katalonien schon heftig in Mitleidenschaft gezogen worden.

Es gab Diskussionen und auch handfeste Streits unter Arbeitskollegen, Freunden und Angehörigen. ""Ich habe Freunde verloren, die ich seit meiner Kindheit hatte"", sagte Anwalt Pedro der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Viele hoffen nun, dass es zu Versöhnungen kommt.

9. Werden die separatistischen Parteien an der Wahl im Dezember teilnehmen oder den Urnengang boykottieren?

Das stand am Wochenende noch nicht fest. Die Einschreibefrist läuft am 7. November ab. Medien berichteten, es habe in den Parteien bereits Treffen gegeben, um über diese Frage zu sprechen.

10. Wird es auch einen Kandidaten Puigdemont geben?

Entgegen früheren Plänen wird Madrid eine Kandidatur von Puigdemont nicht verhindern - sofern der liberale Politiker bis dahin nicht hinter Gittern sitzt.

Der 54-Jährige könnte schon am Montag von der Generalstaatsanwaltschaft unter anderem der Rebellion beschuldigt und inhaftiert werden. Es droht eine Haftstrafe von bis zu 30 Jahren.

Die Jamaika-Unterhändler gehen am Montag in die nächste Sondierungsrunde - und machen sich weiterhin gegenseitig Vorwürfe. Die kleine Runde der Verhandler von CDU, CSU, FDP und Grünen berät zunächst über Bildung und Digitales, dann über Arbeit, Rente, Gesundheit und Pflege sowie über Inneres und Recht.

Am späteren Nachmittag will die große Gruppe mit mehr als 50 Teilnehmern eine Zwischenbilanz zum bisherigen Stand der Dinge ziehen. Die Sondierungsgespräche waren am vergangenen Donnerstag wegen Streitigkeiten vor allem in der Klima- und Flüchtlingspolitik vertagt worden.

Die Vorsitzenden der vier Parteien waren am Sonntagabend zu einem Geheimtreffen in der Bayerischen Landesvertretung in Berlin zusammengekommen, um die Lage und das weitere Vorgehen zu besprechen.

Kanzleramtsminister Peter Altmaier (CDU) sagte am Abend in der ARD-Sendung ""Bericht aus Berlin"", man sei nach den ersten Gesprächen näher an der Aufnahme von Koalitionsverhandlungen, als dies vor zwei oder drei Wochen noch den Anschein gehabt habe.

Weniger optimistisch ist CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt. Er sagte der ""Bild“-Zeitung: ""Die Grünen provozieren das Scheitern von Jamaika.

Die Berge an Plastikmüll auf der Welt werden immer größer und belasten Mensch und Umwelt

Doch können wir auf Plastik verzichten?

Eine HuffPost-Redakteurin hat es ausprobiert - und ist gescheitert

Plastik ist überall. Die Welt versinkt im Müll. Tagtäglich erreichen uns neue Horrormeldungen. Aber nur selten denken wir über die Folgen der Plastik-Schwemme nach. Das wollen wir ändern. Was würde es bedeuten, auf Plastik zu verzichten? HuffPost-Redakteurin Uschi Jonas hat es ausprobiert und dabei gemerkt, vor welch gigantischen Problemen unsere Gesellschaft in den nächsten Jahren steht.

Seit Wochen habe ich mich auf meinen Sizilien-Urlaub gefreut. Doch als ich endlich in Catania ankomme, lande ich wenig später in der hässlichen Realität.

Ich fahre mit dem Mietwagen die Autostrada auf die Stadt zu, die Sonne strahlt, das Meerwasser glitzert, Oleander und Magnolien säumen den Straßenrand.

Und dann sehe ich sie: die Berge an Plastikmüll am Straßenrand. Zerdrückte Joghurtbecher, Einkaufstüten, die im Wind flattern, schmutzige Plastikflaschen, zerfledderte Eisverpackungen.

Schon länger denke ich über solche wachsenden Müllberge nach. Die vollen Säcke, die ich Zuhause alle paar Tage in den Hof schleppe.

Manchmal habe ich das Gefühl, dass unsere Welt in Plastik versinkt - und selten zuvor ist es mir das so klar geworden wie hier in Catania.

Am Straßenrand stapelt sich der Abfall, am Strand verheddern sich Plastikreste an meinen Füßen, im Meer klebt plötzlich ein Stück Folie an meinen Körper. Mal ist der Müll groß, mal klein, mal durchsichtig.

Plastik ist allgegenwärtig. Morgens der Kaffeebecher, mittags das eingepackte Brötchen - und sogar die Zahnpasta enthält winzige Plastikpartikel.

9,6 Millionen Tonnen Plastik verbrauchen wir in Deutschland jedes Jahr

Was würde es bedeuten, auf Plastik zu verzichten? Irgendwo zwischen Sizilien und meiner Heimat München habe ich entschieden, genau das auszuprobieren.

Seitdem habe ich nicht nur viel über mich gelernt, sondern auch verstanden, vor welch gigantischen Problemen unsere Gesellschaft in den nächsten Jahren steht, wenn wir das Plastik-Problem ernsthaft angehen wollen.

Am ersten Tag meines Selbstversuchs habe ich überlegt, wo ich im Alltag das meiste Plastik erlebe. Und schnell war mir klar: im Supermarkt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: So will ein Supermarktbesitzer in seinen Edeka-Filialen künftig Plastikmüll vermeiden



Jedes Mal, wenn ich durch die Obst-Theke bei Rewe, Edeka oder Lidl laufe, frage ich mich, warum müssen zwei Paprika in einer Plastikschale liegen, die dann auch noch von einer Plastiktüte eingeschweißt ist - am besten noch mit Bio-Label drauf?

Aber wie viel Plastikmüll produziere ich eigentlich? Ich lande auf der Website der Verbraucherzentrale.



9,6 Millionen Tonnen Plastik verbrauchen wir in Deutschland jedes Jahr. Das sind rund 130 Kilo pro Kopf.

Weltweit ist der Kunststoffverbrauch in den letzten Jahrzehnten massiv angestiegen. Waren es in den 1950er Jahren noch 1,7 Millionen Tonnen, hat sich das Ganze bis 1989 nahezu um das Hundertfache gesteigert. Im Jahr 2012 waren es schon 288 Millionen Tonnen.

Und die Müll-Mengen lassen sich nicht biologisch abbauen. Ein Joghurtbecher beispielsweise braucht 500 Jahre um sich zu zersetzen.

”Man merkt schnell, dass man vieles gar nicht braucht”, sagt Hannah Sartin vom “Ohne”-Laden

Also was tun? Immer mal wieder hab ich von verpackungsfreien Supermärkte gehört. Die gibt es in vielen deutschen Großstädten. Auch in München.

Im “Ohne”-Laden in der Schellingstraße treffe ich auf Hannah Sartin. Sie hat den Laden vor gut anderthalb Jahren gemeinsam mit ihrem Mann eröffnet.

“Fast jeden Tag kommt jemand zu uns in den Laden, der noch nie da war”, erzählt sie. Fast sei es, wie der Beginn einer neuen Bewegung: “Man fühlt sich frei mit diesem Lebensstil, weil man sich abkoppelt von der Konsumgesellschaft und schnell merkt, dass man vieles gar nicht braucht.”

Der Laden ist kaum größer als ein Kiosk - und trotzdem ist die Auswahl groß: Obst, Gemüse, Nudeln, Reis, Bulgur, Tee, Gewürze, Soßen, Marmeladen, Joghurt, Käse. Was nicht in Glas verpackt ist, ist unverpackt und kann selbst abgefüllt werden - in kleine Baumwollsäckchen, Gläser oder Metalldosen.

Am Ende kaufe ich mir eine Glasflasche, ein bisschen Obst, Couscous, Nudeln und eine Bambus-Zahnbürste. Wirklich alle Lebensmittel bekomme ich aber nicht unverpackt.

Ladenbesitzerin Hannah erzählt mir, dass sie und ihre Familie weitestgehend plastik- und müllfrei leben.

“Ich fand immer, dass die größte Einschränkung im Kopf stattfindet. Am Anfang kann man sich nicht vorstellen, wie das funktionieren soll. Beim Lebensmitteleinkauf dachte ich mir, okay es bleibt nur Obst, Gemüse und Brot übrig, was ich kaufen kann. Aber mit der Zeit haben sich in den verschiedensten Ecken der Stadt neue Möglichkeiten aufgetan, an unverpackte Dinge zu kommen, in Teeläden, Gewürzläden, auf dem Markt”, sagt sie.



Die erste Herausforderung folgt schon auf dem Weg zur Arbeit. Ich kaufe mir morgens gern Butterbrezeln beim Bäcker. Heute hab ich dann eines meiner neuen Baumwollsäckchen mitgenommen, um die Verkäuferin zu bitten, mir die Brezeln ohne Tüte zu geben, die in manchen Bäckereien auch einen Plastikanteil hat.



“Sie können mir die Brezeln direkt auf die Hand geben.”



“Was, nein wieso? Nehmen Sie doch einen Tüte.”



“Nein, nein, das passt, vielen Dank. Ich nehme sie gerne so.”



“Nein, dann bekommen Sie ja ganz buttrige Hände, ich gebe Ihnen wenigstens Servietten dazu.”



“Nein, wirklich, ich brauche nichts.”



“Haben Sie denn so großen Hunger, dass Sie die beiden Brezn gleich verputzen wollen?!”



“Nein, ich esse gleich eine und gebe die andere gleich noch einer Kollegin.”



Ich dachte ernsthaft, die Variante Ich-brauche-keine-Tüte-weil-ich-gleich-esse ist besser oder einfacher, als der Bäckersfrau einen Vortrag über Verpackungen zu halten. Aber morgen werde ich ihr das einfach erklären. Eine Person mehr auf dem Planeten, die über Müll nachdenkt.







Oft hole ich mir für die Mittagspause einen Salat bei unserem Brotzeitmann im Büro. Auch daran bin ich heute gescheitert: Plastikverpackung für den Salat, Plastikverpackung für das Dressing.



Also ab in die Kantine oder künftig selber gekochtes Essen mitbringen in meiner neuen Metalldose.

Abends schaue ich mir den Dokumentarfilm “The Plastic Planet” an. Dort zeigt der österreichische Regisseur Werner Boote die Gefahren von Plastik auf und wie die Kunststoffe immer weiter die ganze Welt verschmutzen.

80 Prozent des Mülls im Meer kommt vom Land, davon ist 75 Prozent Plastik

Ein Satz hat sich dabei besonders in meinen Kopf gebrannt: Alle Plastikteile, die bislang hergestellt wurden, sind immer noch irgendwo auf unserem Planeten. Und jedes Jahr kommen Millionen Tonnen dazu.

Und das meiste davon landet irgendwann im Meer. 75 Prozent des Mülls, der in den Ozeanen landet, ist Plastik, wie der Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) berichtet. ) Allein in Deutschland landet jede Minute eine ganze Tonne Plastik im Meer



➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich unterstütze weltweit Menschen im Kampf gegen den Plastikmüll - von Deutschland bin ich sehr enttäuscht



Laut dem Umweltprogramm der Vereinten Nationen (UNEP) treiben auf jedem Quadratkilometer Meeresoberfläche bis zu 18.000 Plastikteile unterschiedlichster Größe, der WWF spricht sogar von bis zu 46.000. Und das ist nur der sichtbare Teil des Müllbergs. Denn über 70 Prozent des Plastikmülls sinkt auf den Meeresgrund.



Und da schließt sich auch wieder der Kreis nach Catania. Ich habe dort im Gasthaus eines alten Sizilianers gewohnt, der jeden Morgen Frühstück für seine Gäste macht. Mit frisch gepresstem Orangensaft, süßem Gebäck und ganz viel klein portionierten, in Plastik verpackter Butter, Marmelade, Joghurt, Zwieback.

Komplett auf Plastik verzichten - wie soll das gehen?

Tag 2 meines Experiments. 6.50 Uhr, mein Wecker klingelt, ich greife zum Smartphone - Plastikhülle. 6.55 Uhr, ich stehe auf, gehe in die Küche, mache mir Kaffee - die Maschine ist aus Plastik. 7.00 Uhr, ich gehe ins Bad, greife zu meiner Bambus-Zahnbürste (check!), aber dann ist da die Zahnpasta… 7.25 Uhr, ich steige aufs Fahrrad, mein Lenker ist aus Plastik. 8.00 Uhr, ich komme bei der Arbeit an, öffne die Eingangstür mit meiner Zugangskarte - aus Plastik - fahre meinen Laptop hoch, nutze die Maus - Plastik.

Ich bin frustriert. Komplett auf Plastik verzichten - wie soll das gehen?

Ich stöbere durch alle meine Alltagsgegenstände: Schmuck, Taschen, Kosmetikartikel, Shampoo, Kleiderbügel, Haargummis, Rasierer, Smartphone, Stifte, Kopfhörer, EC-Karten und noch so vieles mehr. Überall ist Plastik verarbeitet.

Und während ich mir das klar mache, denke ich über die Alternativen nach: Papier zum Beispiel, Glas und Stoff. Aber sind die wirklich ökologisch sinnvoller? Wenn es keine bio-zertifizierten Produkte sind, benötigt auch die Herstellung von Stofftaschen und Papiertüten viel Wasser und Chemikalien bei der Herstellung. Umweltfreundlicher werden sie erst durch ihre Wiederverwendung.

Auch beim Plastik selbst gibt es Unterschiede. 76 Prozent des Mineralwassers, das in Deutschland getrunken wird, ist in PET-Flaschen abgefüllt. Mehrwegflaschen sind ökologisch um einiges sinnvoller. Die werden gereinigt und wiederbefüllt - und das ist umweltschonender als Einwegflaschen, die geschreddert werden.

Trotzdem bleibt Glas besser als Mehrweg. Glas wird bis zu 50 Mal neu befüllt, Mehrwegflaschen lediglich 25 Mal. Danach landen die Überreste auch irgendwann im Meer, wie NABU berichtet.

Okay, was kann ich jetzt also durch etwas anderes als Plastik ersetzen? Ich beginne damit, eine neue Smartphone-Hülle zu suchen. Und das ist gar nicht so leicht. Selbst wenn ich nach Holz im Internet suche, versteckt sich in den meisten Hüllen trotzdem irgendwie Plastik.

Wasser will ich ab sofort nur noch aus meiner Glasflasche trinken. Doch für mich als Sprudel-Fanatikerin wird das eine große Umstellung bedeuten, wenn ich nur noch Leitungswasser abfülle. Ich werde auch versuchen, die Bambus-Zahnbürste zu nutzen. Auch das ist eine Einschränkung, denn seit Jahren benutze ich eigentlich eine elektrische Zahnbürste. Die gibt es auch nicht ohne Plastik.

Ich suche nach einer plastikfreien Kaffeemaschine. Fehlanzeige. Selbst die teuersten Maschinen haben in der Regel irgendwelche Elemente aus Plastik.

Alles ist voll von Mikroplastik

Meine Herausforderung für den nächsten Tag: Ich versuche Plastik in meinem Alltag zu finden, das man gar nicht sieht. Denn ganz nebenbei, von uns unbemerkt, produzieren wir täglich noch so viel mehr Plastikmüll.

Shampoo, Seife, Zahnpasta, Gesichts-Peelings, Waschmittel, Cremes und Schminke enthalten Plastik. All diesen Produkten wird Kunststoff in flüssiger oder gelartiger Form zugesetzt und als Füllstoff und Bindemittel verwendet oder es dient als Schleifmittel zur Glättung und Reinigung von Haut und Zähnen.

Und das ist noch lange nicht alles.

Jedes Mal, wenn wir beispielsweis eine Fleecejacke in der Waschmaschine waschen, landen 114.000 bis 2.200.000 Polyesterfasern im Abwasser.

Eine Jacke, die einmal gewaschen wird. Ich wasche teilweise mehrmals die Woche. Viele Kleidungsstücke. Immer und immer wieder.

Mikroplastik ist also irgendwie überall. Nicht nur dort, wo wir Plastik sehen, sondern auch in Kosmetika, Textilien und Lebensmitteln.

Und das Problem: Die meisten Kläranlagen können es nicht herausfiltern. Lediglich eine Schlussfiltration könnte die Belastung des Gewässer reduzieren. Doch die ist teuer. Folglich landet Mikroplastik in Flüssen und letztlich im Meer.

Wir nehmen es aber nicht nur zu uns, wenn wir Fisch essen. Sondern auch über Leitungswasser oder Nahrungsmittel wie Milch oder Honig. Sie sind verunreinigt durch kleinste Plastikpartikel, die sich in der Umwelt verteilen.

Und das kann schwere gesundheitliche Folgen für uns haben. Bisphenol A, polyzyklische aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe, Phtalate - das sind alles Chemikalien, die als Weich- und Hartmacher in Plastik verwendet werden. Und die können krebserregend sein, hormonverändernd wirken, Diabetes, Herzkrankheiten und sexuelle Störungen verursachen.

Am Ende des Selbstversuchs: Ernüchterung

Ich mache mich auf die Suche nach mikroplastikfreien Kosmetika und werde im Drogeriemarkt fündig. Auf den meisten steht das explizit drauf.

Ich kaufe mir Gesichtscreme, Shampoo, Zahnpasta und Waschpulver und bin gespannt, ob ich einen Unterschied zu meinen bisherigen Lieblingsprodukten feststelle.

Die Zahnpasta ist aus Nanaminze. Klingt gut. Aber als ich sie benutze, bin ich ein wenig enttäuscht. Ich liebe es, wenn die Zahnpasta für einen richtig frischen Geschmack sorgt und sich meine Zähne total glatt anfühlen. Doch das klappt nicht mit meiner neuen Zahnpasta.

Dafür sind die Creme und das Shampoo super und auch meine frisch gewaschene Wäsche riecht gut. Teurer als die Produkte, die ich sonst benutze, sind sie dennoch.

Apropos Wäsche. Ich liebe Klamotten und ich liebe es, mir neue zu kaufen. Auch gerne online. Ich stöbere durch meine Lieblingsläden im Internet und entdecke, dass es selbst bei einigen großen Modeketten inzwischen ökologische Kleidung gibt. Ob die auch immer plastikfrei ist oder nur recycelt ist nicht immer ersichtlich. Am Ende bestelle ich mir zwei neue T-Shirts, die nicht einmal nennenswert teurer sind.

Doch als die nach ein paar Tagen bei mir ankommen ist es mir fast peinlich, das Paket zu öffnen: Denn auch mein vermeintlich nachhaltiger Einkauf kommt in Plastiktüten verpackt bei mir an.

Am Ende meines Selbstversuch überkommt mich vor allem eines: Ernüchterung. Es kommt mir vor, als sei Plastik nicht aus meinem Alltag wegzudenken. Klar, ein paar Dinge sind Luxusprodukte, die ich eigentlich nicht brauche. Andere kann ich ersetzen. Aber komplett darauf verzichten? Unmöglich.

Viele plastikfreien Produkte sind teurer, andere bedeuten, dass ich meine Gewohnheiten einschränken muss, mehr Zeit brauche, um Dinge zu besorgen.

Ich werde es höchstwahrscheinlich nie schaffen, vollständig auf Plastik zu verzichten. Aber ich will und kann Schritt für Schritt Dinge in meinem Alltag verändern.

Ich möchte aufhören, online Kleidung zu shoppen, die immer in Plastiktüten verpackt wird und einen hohen Polyester-Anteil hat. Mein Obst und Gemüse kaufe ich ab jetzt auf dem Wochenmarkt oder in einem verpackungsfreien Supermarkt und überlege mir bei allem, was ich kaufe, ob ich das jetzt wirklich brauche und ob es eine umweltschonende Alternative gibt.

Eine Welt ohne Plastik wird es leider nicht mehr geben. Aber wir müssen unseren Konsum überdenken.

Und wenn wir alle einen kleinen Schritt gehen, wird daraus ein großer.

The Taj Mahal is one manifestation of this entire debate.","ADVERTISEMENT

The Taj Mahal is not new to controversies. Much before Yogi Adityanath and Sangeet Som's vehement rhetoric, the Taj was the subject of books that went to the extent of trying to claim that the Taj was a Shiv temple originally. PN Oak was one of the people who spent a great deal of time and effort in trying to prove this. Indeed it was the name used by Oak in his work for the Taj Mahal, 'Tejo Mahalay,' which was recently used by a group of young men when they decided to recite prayers in the gardens of the Taj until they unceremoniously kicked out. The men were from Yogi Adityanath's Hindu Yuva Vahini and went to pray in the complex as a precursor to Adityanath's forthcoming visit- his first ever- to the Taj.

In recent years, theories such as that of Oak, have resulted in small video clips being circulated that try and use 'evidence' to make a case for the 'Tejo Mahalay.'

All this would be amusing were it not for the fact that a veritable industry has sprouted around this charade. Wiki historians, WhatsApp policy analysts, Facebook sociologists and YouTube anthropologists have spread so much misinformation that I have lost count of the number times that educated people have asked me to 'seriously consider this theory.' Of course this led me to question their education more than the myths around the Taj Mahal, but nonetheless, this also points to the manner in which a deep insecurity has taken over large sections of the population.

Why target monuments?

The first and most obvious answer is that historical monuments tend to symbolise the culmination of some individual or group's political and financial power. In the case of the Taj, it additionally represented the love of a man for his wife. Beyond this, however, monuments are also important because they tend to anchor communities in a certain cultural and civilisational context. In other words monuments, art and literature amongst other things root people in a certain sense of self.

Things like art and literature have more ephemeral lives as they can be destroyed and of course, can also fade from memory due to neglect or a change in aesthetic norms. The names of spaces, places and cities can also be changed. Monuments, however, are not so easy to ignore. They are often giant albeit mute symbols that complicate myopic historical narratives and act as an example of a past when some 'other' was in power. In this case, the perceived 'other' is the Muslim and the 'victim' the Hindu. Of course, theories (backed with evidence) of how the Mughals were equally, if not more concerned, with power rather than simply religion, generally fall on deaf ears as do any arguments that show how 'Muslim' and 'Hindu' are not stable and fixed categories that have remained the same over the course of history.

Since 'alt-theories' of the Taj originally being a temple have not yet made Supreme Court judges sit up and take them seriously, one course of action is to institutionally ignore them so that the Taj, like countless other monuments, fall victim to natural degradation and eventually becomes a ruin. The other alternative is to try to co-opt such symbols and monuments, and attribute a new interpretation or new history, à la Oak while ignoring their rich and complicated pasts.

Thankfully, due to national and international protection, the option of simply destroying the Taj Mahal seems to be off the table, at least for now.

Yogi Adityanath's recent statement in which he deemed the Taj acceptable because it was the product of the labour of the sons of 'Bharat Mata' is one such example. Perhaps the Yogi had a revelation that beauty often emerges from upheaval and violence. Perhaps he has become, God preserve us, a socialist. However, what seems most likely is that he has realised that his virulent rhetoric will serve no purpose other than causing disrepute in the international community. Of course, the destruction of monuments is something that the international community is intimately familiar with.

Just like Sangeet Som deemed the Taj to be a monument 'built by traitors,' leaders of ISIS and the Taliban made similar claims about Sufi Shrines, churches, temples, churches or the Buddhas in Bamiyaan in order to justify their destruction. The traitor, in those cases, was merely replaced by the 'kafir.' Thankfully, due to national and international protection, the option of simply destroying the Taj Mahal seems to be off the table, at least for now. The destruction of religious or historical sites is about severing the past from the present. By wiping out monuments these organisations are essentially levelling the historical landscape so that there are no more physical reminders of a complicated and often contradictory past.

There can be no doubt that while the Taj Mahal is certainly a monument that is the result of Islamic influences amongst others, it is not a Muslim monument. Indeed the broadly Indian influences such as the use of the motif of the lotus speak of a range of inspirations, which in turn is precisely what irks the likes of Som and Adityanath. Indeed, it is precisely this complicated past that also offers an insight into some the broader issues that animate the Taj Mahal controversy. The controversy around this monument is merely symptomatic of a wider malaise that is linked to questions regarding Muslim belonging in India.

This blanket condemnation of everything that is 'Muslim' as un-Indian- be it language, culture, clothes, spaces and places and even food, will only result in further alienation.

Those who say that the Taj is not a part of India's cultural heritage also question the loyalties of Indian Muslims. However, in the debate about Muslim patriotism, the key point that is often glossed over if not ignored is that it is not simply a question of whether the Muslims can be patriotic or nationalistic but it is about how these feelings are conveyed. According to this worldview, being patriotic is not enough but what Muslims must also accept is how to express their patriotism. The rites and rituals, symbols and history that animate this patriotism must also conform to some standard. While controversies about the recitation of the Vande Mataram illustrate one aspect of the debate, the Taj Mahal also is symptomatic of this phenomenon and herein lies the contradiction.

Monuments, much like other cultural symbols, anchor or root communities and allow them to develop a sense of selfhood and belonging. So it seems patently absurd that on the one hand the loyalties of Muslims to India are called into question while on the other, the symbols through which Muslims can organically root their belonging in India are deemed to be un-Indian. This blanket condemnation of everything that is 'Muslim' as un-Indian- be it language, culture, clothes, spaces and places and even food, will only result in further alienation. Perhaps, however, this is exactly what Som and others of his ilk want.

The fundamental issue then is about defining the idea of India and dictating the terms and conditions under which loyalty to this idea can be subscribed to. The Taj Mahal is one manifestation of this entire debate. Many of our current political leaders and their organisations seem intent on manufacturing a sense of historical victimhood to detract from the very real issues that confront us today. It seems that even one of the seven wonders of the world, a monument built to symbolise love and a living example of the confluence of different cultures is able to completely destabilise their fragile sense of self.

The Oppenheimers argued that their company, Fireblade, was granted permission by Gigaba, home affairs minister at the time, to operate the terminal in January 2016. The family said Gigaba should not be allowed to change his mind without a good reason.

Gigaba reportedly changed his mind five days after granting permission, after intervention from Denel chairperson Dan Mantsha, who raised security concerns. But the Oppenheimers argued that the change of heart from government was because of the Guptas, who were trying to get in on the deal by being brought on as BEE partners.

Gigaba initially denied approving the Fireblade bid at all, according to News24.

According to Business Day, Denel CEO Zwelakhe Ntshepe reportedly told the court that these allegations were not true and said the company had never had any business dealings with the Guptas.

Judge Sulet Potterill reportedly called the ""volte face"" (about turn) of Denel ""inexplicable and irrational"", and said it ""cannot negate the minister's decision to grant the approval"".

Potterill further ruled that Gigaba's approval ""is of force and effect and may not be renounced or revoked without due cause and may be implemented and relied on by the applicant (the Oppenheimers).""

The Oppenheimers and the Guptas have a history, with the Oppenheimers instructing the Guptas to remove their luxury jet from the Fireblade terminal.

Don't throw away your Stephen King collection just yet. But the Master of the Macabre might want to keep an eye out behind him, because scientists have just unleashed a nightmare machine on a mission to churn out its own bone-chilling tales.

MIT researchers have applied the electrodes and brought to life a new fiction-writing bot they call Shelley — after ""Frankenstein'' author Mary Shelley. To keep the bot busy — no wandering the countryside terrorizing villagers! — the team gave it a crash course in the horror genre, forcing it to read 140,000 stories published by amateur writers on a popular online forum.

Now Shelley's artificial neural network is generating its own stories , posting opening lines on Twitter, then taking turns with humans in collaborative storytelling.

Cold, calculating horror

""She's creating really interesting and weird stories that have never really existed in the horror genre,'' said Pinar Yanardag, a postdoctoral researcher at the MIT Media Lab. One strange tale, for instance, involved a pregnant man who woke up in a hospital.

The lab's experiment, launched in time for Halloween, follows a similar project to create scary images last year. But can all that deep-learning technology and powerful computation truly turn out terrifying tales? Let's just say the experiment is still in progress.

King, the world's most famous living horror writer, has said it can take him ""months and even years '' to get a novel's opening paragraph right. Shelley takes a couple of seconds — and the results can be a little awkward.

""The doll came at me with a syringe,'' the bot posted on Twitter on Friday. ""Its blood shot out of its mouth, and it began to uncover itself. It was then that it began to dance.''

Its insatiable appetite .. for data

Shelley's sentences are inspired by the hive mind it's learned from: a crew of horror hobbyists who participate in Reddit's ""r/nosleep'' forum. Machine-learning algorithms are fueled by big troves of data, and these amateur writers have produced about 700 megabytes of home-grown horror over the past decade. The researchers didn't train Shelley in the genre's classics, both for copyright reasons and because there just aren't enough of them.

""If you look at all the literature by Lovecraft or Stephen King or Edgar Allan Poe, it would be just a few megabytes,'' said MIT research scientist Manuel Cebrian. ""We would still not have enough data.''

Yanardag and Cebrian are themselves aspiring horror fiction writers. While readers might not be buying Shelley-produced books anytime soon, the system learns from the feedback it gets, and might help nudge a human writer into thinking more creatively.

""You tend to get stuck,'' Cebrian said. ""This kind of technology helps you write the next paragraph so you don't get so-called writer's block.''

Es geschah mitten in einem Fußballspiel vergangenen Jahres im amerikanischen Atlanta. Reuben Nsemoh verlor nach dem Tritt eines Gegenspielers gegen den Kopf sein Bewusstsein. Sein Trainer sagte dem Nachrichtensender WSB-TV, dass der damals 16-jährige nicht mehr geatmet habe.

Als er kurzzeitig wieder bei Bewusstsein war, habe er mehrere Krämpfe erlitten, ehe ihn Sanitäter ins Krankenhaus einlieferten. Daraufhin fiel er drei Tage lang ins Koma.

Als er erwachte, konnte Reuben kein Wort Englisch mehr, obwohl er das seit seiner Kindheit gesprochen hatte. Stattdessen sprach auf einmal fließend Spanisch.

Er sprach plötzlich eine andere Sprache

Seine Eltern versicherten, dass er zuvor kein Wort Spanisch konnte. Gänzlich unbekannt war dem Teenager die Fremdsprache allerdings davor nicht, erzählte er etwas später dem lokalen Radiosender WSB in einem Interview. ""Meine Freunde haben immer auf Spanisch mit mir geredet und wollten es mir so beibringen."" Gemocht habe er die fremde Sprache aber nie.

Was ihm widerfuhr, ist kein Einzelfall

Was wie ein Wunder klingt, ist allerdings kein Einzelfall: In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten gab es immer wieder Fälle, in denen Menschen plötzlich fließend eine nie erlernte Sprache sprachen. Das sogenannte Fremdsprachen-Akzent-Syndrom tritt normalerweise nach einem Schlaganfall oder einem Schädel-Hirn-Trauma auf.

Und das amerikanische “Time“-Magazin berichtete von einer Texanerin, die sogar nach einer Kieferoperation auf einmal mit einem britischen Akzent sprach.

Als die Ärzte Reubens Gehirnscans anschauten, prophezeiten sie, dass der Teenager sich wieder erholen würde. So kam es auch. Einige Wochen, nachdem Reuben wieder aus dem Koma erwacht war, konnte er sich wieder auf Englisch ausdrücken. Sein Spanisch wurde immer holpriger.

Mir fiel auf: Außer Ihnen lächelte niemand in dem ganzen Waggon. An den Gesichtern der Menschen konnte ich erkennen: Alle waren fertig von der Arbeit, der Uni, der Schule.

Alle wollten nur nach Hause. Die Stimmung war wie ein grauer Schleier, der sich über den ganzen Waggon gelegt hatte.

Nicht einmal die Kassiererin bei dm hatte zurückgelächelt, als ich ihr ein paar Minuten zuvor am Bahnhof Payback-Karte gereicht hatte.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich habe eine Woche lang jeden Tag einen Fremden angesprochen - das ist mir passiert

Sie begannen also, über meine Tasche zu reden und ich dachte: Na toll, wieder eines dieser kurzen Gespräche, die man aus Höflichkeit führen muss. Aber dann geschah etwas, das ich nicht erwartet hatte.

Die Smalltalk-Barriere war innerhalb kürzester Zeit wie weggeblasen. Wir unterhielten uns über unsere Familien, das Reisen und die Freiheiten meiner Generation. Zum ersten Mal seit Langem saß jemand neben mir, der wirklich zuhörte.

Zuhören, nicht um zu antworten

Nicht, um zu antworten. Nicht, um eine besondere Information herauszupicken, die er auf sich beziehen konnte, wie ""Oh, du hast also gerade eine Trennung hinter dir? Also bei mir war es damals wirklich schwer, ich habe nächtelang geweint.""

Sie waren jemand, der zuhört, um zu verstehen. Jemand, der nachhakt, mitfühlt. Und das nicht, weil er auf irgendetwas hinaus ist.

Irgendwann fiel das Thema auf einen guten Freund von mir, der vor ein paar Wochen in einem Motorradunfall verunglückt ist.

Von Ihnen kam kein: ""Ja, ich hatte da auch mal einen Freund, der einen Motorradunfall hatte. Ganz schlimm war das für mich."" Sie sagten einfach: ""Das muss richtig weh getan haben, oder? Wie war das, als Sie es erfahren haben?""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Schluss mit der Oberflächlichkeit!

Ich muss Sie komplett entgeistert angesehen haben. So offen und unverstellt hatte mich das noch nie jemand gefragt. Nicht einmal meine engsten Freunde. Sie haben mich in dem Moment zu Tränen gerührt. Auch Sie teilten etwas von sich mit mir.

Dabei kannte ich nicht einmal Ihren Namen

Sie erzählten mir, wie Sie die Liebe ihres Lebens verloren und wie gerne Sie Oma geworden wären. Es fühlte sich an als würden wir uns seit Jahren kennen. Dabei kannte ich nicht einmal Ihren Namen.

Wir fuhren etwa eine Stunde gemeinsam im Zug und redeten ohne Pause. Dann kamen wir in Ebersberg an. Ihre Station. Sie erhoben sich und richteten Ihren Mantel. Ich wollte nicht, dass Sie gehen.

Ich hatte Ihnen doch gerade so ziemlich mein ganzes Leben anvertraut. Sie bedankten sich für das Gespräch und mit einem letzten Lächeln schwanden sie durch die automatische Tür.

Da saß ich, wieder allein mit all den müden und kaputten Gesichtern. Wehmut überkam mich.

Liebe fremde Frau im Zug: Ich weiß weder Ihren Namen, noch wo Sie im Moment sind. Aber ich möchte mich bei Ihnen bedanken - dafür, dass Sie mir gezeigt haben: Es gibt noch Menschen, die wirklich zuhören. Nicht, um zu antworten, sondern um zu verstehen.

Ich war Ihnen in dieser Stunde im Zug näher als ich es den meisten meiner Freunde jemals gewesen bin.

And an important photo of a bunch of ring-tailed lemurs sunbathing to start the day:

And there's this video compilation of pet lemurs doing things like holding tiny paper umbrellas over their head:

According to the Lemur Conservation Network, the aim of World Lemur Day is to ""raise awareness for lemur conservation, and tell the world how amazing lemurs and Madagascar are"".

D'en finir, aussi, avec l'impunité des hommes célèbres qui violent, agressent, harcèlent et tuent des femmes et des enfants sans que cela ne gêne leur carrière"", peut-on lire dans la pétition lancée le 25 octobre par la féministe Laure Salmona.

Le but de cette pétition n'était autre qu'annuler la rétrospective de la Cinémathèque française consacrée à Polanski. Une demande que le musée a refusé très clairement dans un communiqué. ""Fidèle à ses valeurs et à sa tradition d'indépendance, La Cinémathèque n'entend se substituer à aucune justice. Son rôle de Musée du cinéma ne consiste pas à placer qui que ce soit sur un quelconque 'piédestal' moral. Ceux qui nous reprochent cela ne mettent jamais les pieds dans nos salles et ignorent tout de nos missions de conservation et transmission"", écrit l'institution, répondant ainsi à la pétition publiée le même jour.

En plein déluge de témoignages contre les harceleurs sexuels, l'exposition ne pouvait pas échapper aux militants. Le regard plutôt compatissant que la plupart des Français a longtemps porté sur le réalisateur Roman Polanski est-il en train de devenir noir? Si la France, à l'image de la Suisse ou de la Pologne, a accueilli celui qui a fui les États-Unis en 1978, elle pourrait aujourd'hui être le lieu d'un procès public.

Cette colère que certaines personnes éprouvent envers Roman Polanski est due à un épisode de sa vie qui remonte aux années 70. En 1977, après une séance photo en Californie, Roman Polanski, alors âgé de 43 ans, a été poursuivi pour avoir violé Samantha Geimer, 13 ans. Après 42 jours de prison, puis sa libération sous caution, le cinéaste a plaidé coupable de ""rapports sexuels illégaux"" avec une mineure. Avant l'annonce du verdict, craignant d'être lourdement condamné (ndlr: il risquait jusqu'à 50 ans de prison), il a choisi de fuir les États-Unis.

Depuis, le cinéaste, qui a épousé Emmanuelle Seigner en 1989, a réalisé ses plus beaux films. En avance sur les techniques de son époque, Roman Polanski est l'un des plus grands réalisateurs du XXe siècle. Ses oeuvres lui ont valu les honneurs du monde du cinéma. César, Oscars, Palme d'Or... Le cinéaste a reçu les plus belles récompenses du 7ème art. Chinatown, Tess, Rosemary's baby sans oublier Le Pianiste ont fait de lui un artiste admiré.

Mais aujourd'hui son talent irréfutable ne suffit plus à ""mettre de côté"" son passé. À l'heure où les langues se délient sur Internet mais aussi dans la rue, comme dimanche 29 octobre lors du rassemblement #MeToo à Paris, à l'heure où la Une des Inrockuptibles sur Bertrand Cantat indigne nombre de Français et notamment des artistes et des membres du gouvernement à l'image de Marlène Schiappa, la secrétaire d'État chargée de l'Égalité entre les femmes et les hommes, à l'heure où des dizaines de femmes prennent leur courage à deux mains et accusent Harvey Weinstein, producteur hollywoodien ultra-puissant, de viol, d'harcèlement ou d'agression sexuels, il se pourrait bien que le statut d'artiste ou d'homme de pouvoir ne suffise plus à faire taire la révolte.

Pourtant, l'histoire de Roman Polanski ne date pas d'hier, et pendant de nombreuses années les médias ne se sont pas tant préoccupés de son passé, ou plutôt si, mais pas de celui-ci. ""Roman Polanski, le survivant"" titrait un article du magazine Fémina en septembre 2002 en référence à son enfance dans le ghetto de Cracovie et à l'assassinat en 1969 de sa femme Sharon Tate, enceinte de huit mois, par Charles Manson et ses fidèles. À l'époque l'agression sexuelle est évoquée en une ligne et le journal s'interroge: ""coup monté?"".

Lors de la sortie du Pianiste en 2002, Roman Polanski est porté aux nues, même aux États-Unis où le cinéaste a droit, malgré son absence, à une standing ovation en recevant son Oscar du meilleur réalisateur. Dans la salle, certains visages sont perplexes mais la majorité de l'assemblée se lève, suivant l'exemple de Martin Scorsese et de Meryl Streep.

Aujourd'hui, le réalisateur de La Vénus à la fourrure est largement montré du doigt pour le détournement de mineur pour lequel il a plaidé coupable en 1973. ""J'en ai marre. Ce n'est pas agréable. Ras-le-bol"", expliquait-il à Léa Salamé en octobre 2016 à propos de l'image de violeur à laquelle les journalistes le renvoient sans cesse. Pourtant de nombreuses personnalités, notamment celles qui évoluent dans le milieu du cinéma, le défendent.

En janvier dernier, sa nomination à la présidence des César était loin de faire l'unanimité. Des associations féministes, des milliers d'internautes et même la ministre des Droits des femmes de l'époque Laurence Rossignol s'en sont insurgés. Face à la polémique, le réalisateur franco-polonais a renoncé à cet honneur. Pourtant, plus de 26 ans plus tôt, en 1991, Roman Polanski a été à la tête du jury du festival de Cannes sans que l'on crie au scandale. Les temps changent.

Mais il peut toujours compter en France sur de nombreux artistes qui, semble-t-il, le défendront toujours. Lors de la polémique des César, ils ont été nombreux à prendre sa défense. Parmi eux, Catherine Deneuve, ou encore le producteur Dominique Besnehard qui estime qu'il s'agit d'un ""débat périmé"". George Clooney, lui, trouve ""effrayant d'imaginer qu'on soit encore après lui"" alors que le cinéaste est aujourd'hui âgé de 83 ans.

""Dans cette période qui est très inflammable, où tout d'un coup les réseaux sociaux, des gens, dont on sait pas trop d'où ça sort, etc, qui exigent des choses, arrivent à vous dégommer Roman Polanski (...) Je ne lui pardonne pas comme je ne l'accable pas, je ne sais pas trop ce qui s'est passé. Je sais juste qu'en quarante ans, on ne lui a jamais rien dit"", confiait au sujet du cinéaste l'acteur et amoureux d'histoire Lorant Deutsch, invité sur le plateau de ""Thé ou Café"" en février dernier.

​​​​​

""Personne ne veut dire du mal de Polanski parce qu'il est une icône et que tous les acteurs rêvent de tourner avec lui"", assurait un professionnel du cinéma au Parisien lors de la polémique des César. ""Si un comédien le critique, il va passer pour un traître dans le milieu"", expliquait le représentant de plusieurs acteurs importants au quotidien français.

Mais certains osent. Lors des Molières, en février, Blanche Gardin a attaqué frontalement, mais sans citer de noms, le réalisateur de Chinatown en racontant une histoire de son enfance. ""J'adorais être sur scène avec mes petits camarades, surtout parce que pendant qu'on était sur scène le metteur en scène pouvait pas nous toucher. C'était un metteur en scène génial par ailleurs, hein, il faut savoir séparer l'homme de l'artiste.C'est bizarre que cette indulgence s'applique seulement aux artistes. On dit pas, par exemple, d'un boulanger: 'c'est vrai, il viole un peu des gosses dans le fournil, mais il fait quand même une baguette extraordinaire'"".

Aujourd'hui, de nombreuses personnes influentes souhaitent que ""la parole se libère"", comme le dit Françoise Nyssen, ministre de la Culture.

La société des réalisateurs de films, donc Jacques Audiard fait notamment partie, semble elle aussi changer de cap après l'affaire Weinstein. Elle qui ne s'était pas exprimée jusqu'alors a jugé qu'elle se devait de faire un communiqué pour clarifier sa position. ""En tant que réalisateurs, nous sommes dans une position qui nous engage. Nous en sommes conscients. Nous vivons les symptômes d'un écosystème encore trop inégalitaire, fortement hiérarchisé, qui concerne l'industrie toute entière. Abus de pouvoir, centralisation du pouvoir dans les mains des mêmes, dérives sexuelles s'appuyant sur la part affective à l'œuvre dans le processus de fabrication des films, font de l'industrie du cinéma, qui est loin d'être la seule concernée, une vitrine éloquente de ces abus. [...] Un vent de changement est en train de souffler, c'est notre responsabilité collective d'y prendre part"", peut-on lire sur le communiqué.

Le vent tourne mais l'image de Roman Polanski est complexe car il est à la fois victime et bourreau. Victime par son enfance et le drame familial vécu plusieurs dizaines d'années plus tard, bourreau par le viol qu'il a affligé à une enfant un après-midi de 1973. Aujourd'hui, les mentalités et les accusations qui se multiplient pourraient bien faire pencher la balance.

DALLAS — The owner of a now-closed orphanage in India where a young girl was living before a Texas couple adopted her last year says the child had no difficulty eating despite her adoptive father's account to police when reporting her missing.

The body of 3-year-old Sherin Mathews was found Sunday in suburban Dallas in a culvert under a road about a half-mile from her parents' home. Police and volunteers had been searching for the girl since Oct. 7.

Investigators have said that her father, Wesley Mathews, initially told them he had sent the girl outside at 3 a.m. on Oct. 7 to stand near a tree across the alley from the family's fence because she refused to drink her milk. He said he went to check on her after about 15 minutes.

Mathews told police the girl had been malnourished when she was adopted and needed to eat whenever she was awake to help her gain weight. But orphanage owner Babitha Kumari told television station WFAA the girl had no problems and that Wesley and Sini Mathews appeared loving when they were going through the adoption process.

""The child had no problem at all when she was here, neither in drinking milk or eating,"" Kumari said.

A phone call to the international adoption agency believed to have helped the couple adopt Sherin was not returned Wednesday.

Wesley Mathews was initially charged with endangering or abandoning a child after reporting the girl missing on Oct. 7. He changed his story to police Monday, saying the girl choked on milk and died in the family's garage before he took her body away. He was arrested and charged with felony injury to a child, which carries a sentence of up to life in prison.

Mathews was transferred to the Dallas County jail on Wednesday, which is routine for inmates charged with higher level felonies. The Dallas County Sheriff's Department said he has been placed on suicide watch.

A judge reviewed his bond and left it at $1 million.

Mitch Nolte, an attorney for Sini Mathews, said in a written statement Wednesday that she has submitted to several long interviews with police since Oct. 7, and because she had nothing to do with the ""death or removal"" of the child's body, her lawyers see no need for her to ""endure further police interrogation.""",Indian Orphanage Official Says 3-Year-Old Sherin Mathews Had No Trouble Drinking Milk Before Her Adoption,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/26/indian-orphanage-official-says-3-year-old-sherin-mathews-had-no-trouble-drinking-milk-before-her-adoption_a_23256461/

Plusieurs médias espagnols relatent - et pour certains s'étonnent, dont le HuffPost Espagne - que le président séparatiste destitué soit aperçu trinquant dans un restaurant de Gérone (ville dont il était maire jusqu'en janvier 2016), sur la Plaça del Vi, au moment même où sa déclaration si attendue était diffusée aux Catalans et aux Espagnols.

Le média LaSexta a pu d'ailleurs en capturer les images: Carles Puigdemont attablé avec quelques personnes, verre de vin à la main, renvoyant une déroutante image de normalité qui tranche avec la crise sans précédent que connaît le pays. À sa sortie de l'établissement, celui-ci était attendu et chaudement applaudi par une foule de sympathisants catalans, comme vous pouvez le voir dans les vidéos ci-dessous.

Dans son allocution de samedi, Carles Puigdemont a poussé encore plus loin son bras de fer avec Madrid, appelant ses partisans à s'opposer pacifiquement à la reprise en main de la région, au lendemain de sa déclaration d'indépendance.

""Nous sommes certains que la meilleure manière de défendre les victoires obtenues jusqu'à ce jour est l'opposition démocratique à l'application de l'article 155"" de la Constitution espagnole, utilisé par Madrid pour prendre le contrôle de la Catalogne, a-t-il déclaré.

Le dirigeant séparatiste n'a pas précisé de quelle manière cette opposition doit se manifester. Mais depuis plusieurs jours, des Comités de défense de la République issus des quartiers appellent à la ""résistance pacifique"" des Catalans contre la tutelle de l'Etat.

Dans un décor composé d'un drapeau catalan et d'un drapeau européen, l'indépendantiste a affirmé que la destitution de son gouvernement et la dissolution du parlement régional décidées vendredi par Madrid étaient ""contraires à la volonté des citoyens"" de Catalogne. Il a promis de continuer à ""œuvrer pour construire un pays libre"", de manière ""pacifique"".

Netflix also said in a statement that it was ""deeply troubled"" about an allegation made against Spacey by actor Anthony Rapp who said Spacey had made a sexual advance to him in 1986, when Rapp was 14 years old.

Netflix did not give an explicit reason for deciding to air one more season of ""House of Cards"" before pulling the plug on the Emmy-winning, critically acclaimed show, its first original hit series.

But Netflix spokeswoman Karen Barragan said the decision was made months ago, long before the allegation surfaced against Spacey, 58, a two-time Oscar-winning film star, Tony-winning stage performer and former creative director of London's famed Old Vic theater.

The streaming service's statement read in part, ""In response to last night's revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.""

Spacey said in a Twitter post on Sunday that he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear Rapp's story of the encounter, which he said he did not remember. He wrote that he owed Rapp a ""sincere apology"" for what he said would have been ""deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.""

A representative for Spacey did not immediately respond to Reuters for comment.

In an interview with BuzzFeed, Rapp, now 46, recounted attending a party hosted by Spacey in which the older actor picked him up, brought him to a bed and lay down on top of him after other guests had left.

According to Rapp, the young actor had the impression Spacey was drunk, pushed him away and left.

I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out 1/3 — Anthony Rapp (@albinokid) October 30, 2017

Spacey, who has won Oscars for the films ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""American Beauty,"" also said that Rapp's story ""had encouraged me to address other things in my life.""

""In my life I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I now choose to live life as a gay man,"" Spaceywrote.

""I want to deal with this honestly and openly,"" he said, ""and that starts with me examining my own behavior.""

The actor for years had declined to publicly discuss his sexuality.

Rapp, who went on to star in the hit Broadway musical ""Rent,"" was starting his career on Broadway at the time of the alleged incident, appearing in a production of ""Precious Sons"" with Ed Harris and Judith Ivey. Spacey was then on stage with Jack Lemmon in a revival of the Eugene O'Neill play ""Long Day's Journey Into Night.""

""He was trying to seduce me,"" Rapp told BuzzFeed of the encounter with Spacey. ""I don't know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.""

Rapp said on Twitter overnight that he had decided to come forward and tell his story, ""standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out ... to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me.""

Everything he wanted to say about the experience had been covered in the interview, Rapp tweeted, adding that he had no further comment to make.

Some on social media expressed anger at Spacey's conflation of an apology for sexual misconduct and a public acknowledgement of being gay.

Hollywood and some top U.S. companies have been rocked in recent weeks by allegations from scores of women that executives had sexually harassed or assaulted them.

American movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including some who said they were raped.

Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. He has since been fired as chief executive of The Weinstein Company, which he co-founded and which has been one of Hollywood's most influential forces since its launch in October 2005.

The Supreme Court today directed the father of a Kerala woman, who had converted to Islam and married a Muslim man, to produce her before it on November 27.

A bench, comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, asked senior advocate Shyam Divan, representing the father of the woman, to ensure that she is produced that day for interaction with the bench, which is likely to ascertain her mental stage and whether she had given free consent to the marriage.

The National Investigation Agency, represented by Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh, said there was a well-oiled machinery working in the state and they are indulging in the indoctrination and radicalisation of the society in the state where as many as 89 cases of similar nature have been reported.

Kerala 'Love Jihad' Case: Supreme Court observed that the consent of the girl is prime. She is a major; Hearing underway — ANI (@ANI) October 30, 2017

Divan, appearing for woman's father K M Ashokan, claimed the alleged husband of his daughter is a radicalised man and several organisations like Popular Front of India (PFI) are involved in radicalisation of the society.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for her husband Shafin Jahan, opposed the NIA's submission and that of the woman's father.

The woman, a Hindu, had converted to Islam and later married Jahan. It was alleged that the woman was recruited by Islamic State's mission in Syria and Jahan was only a stooge.

Jahan had on September 20 approached the apex court seeking recall of its August 16 order directing the NIA to investigate the controversial case of conversion and marriage of a Hindu woman with him.

Meanwhile, the Kerala government had on October 7 told the Supreme Court that its police had conducted a ""thorough investigation"" into her conversion and subsequent marriage to Jahan and did not find material warranting the transfer of probe to the NIA.

""En el México de la fragmentación política para el PRI es prescindible el resto de la sociedad mexicana"", sentenció el catedrático.","El dinosaurio sigue aquí. Esa pareciera ser la conclusión de varios analistas políticos que, a la luz de hechos recientes ocurridos en los últimos meses, ven una reconfiguración de la vieja maquinaria político-electoral del PRI de cara a las elecciones de 2018, con todo lo que eso implica para la incipiente democracia mexicana.

En su columna Alhajero, la periodista Martha Anaya considera que una serie de hechos ocurrido en los últimos meses evidencian los ""coletazos dinosáuricos"" con los que el PRI busca mantenerse en el poder.

Los casos que enumera la periodista son: 1) la campaña mediática contra Ricardo Anaya, presidente del PAN, en El Universal; 2) la ""extraña rebelión"" de cinco senadores panistas afines a Felipe Calderón y promotores de José Antonio Meade; 3) la promoción ""desmedida"" de Margarita Zavala como candidata presidencial del PAN; 4) la filtración sobre la casa de 13 millones de pesos que tiene Alejandra Barrales, presidenta del PRD, en Lomas de Chapultepec; 5) la exigencia del Tribunal Electoral del Poder Judicial de la Federación para que el PRD renueve su dirigencia nacional en 60 días naturales; 6) la ""súbita"" renuncia del Procurador General de la República, Raúl Cervantes tras haber concluido la investigación del caso Odebrecht en que se indagaba una supuesta inyección de recursos ilícitos a la campaña presidencial de Enrique Peña Nieto; 7) la destitución de Santiago Nieto como Fiscal Especial para la Atención de Delitos Electorales, días después de la salida de Cervantes; 8) la detención del dirigente del PT en Aguascalientes, a quien se le acusa de lavar 100 millones de pesos, en un caso que involucra al dirigente nacional del PT, Alberto Anaya, quien va en alianza con Morena rumbo a 2018.

¿Qué nos dice todo lo anterior? No hay que ser brujos para descifrarlo. Son los coletazos del dinosaurio –hoy el tercero en las encuestas y con un Presidente en niveles de popularidad ínfimos- en este arranque del proceso electoral"". Martha Anaya, periodista

""Y no son coletazos de un dinosaurio moribundo, valga señalarlo; sino de un partido en el gobierno que sabe que tiene en sus manos el poder para desbrozar el camino y arrebatar, de ser necesario (como en el Estado de México) el triunfo para su causa"", agregó la periodista.

Otro caso emblemático de cómo el PRI ha podido sortear las adversidades es la manera en que el TEPJF ordenó al Instituto Nacional Electoral ajustar el rebase de topes de gastos de campaña de Miguel Riquelme, candidato del PRI a la gubernatura de Coahuila, situación que prácticamente valida el triunfo del tricolor en el terruño de los hermanos Humberto y Rubén Moreira.

""Con un regalazo de esos, a qué priista le preocupará en 2018 rebasar los topes de campaña"", señaló el periodista Salvador Camarena, en una columna donde explica los argumentos con los que el TEPJF le rebajó casi un millón de pesos a la campaña de Riquelme por una polémica contratación de publicidad en Facebook.

""En el embate contra el Instituto Nacional Electoral, el PRI ha encontrado a un aliado útil en el Tribunal Electoral del Poder Judicial de la Federación"", escribió Juan Pardinas, del Instituto Mexicano para la Competitividad (IMCO). ""Con la bendición de los magistrados, México avanza hacia la elección presidencial más inequitativa en cuatro sexenios. Después de décadas y esfuerzos, nuestro país construyó un sistema electoral que ofrecía certidumbre y confianza en los resultados electorales. En el 2018, ese edificio se puede venir abajo"".

De este modo, la manera en que se definió la elección en Coahuila y el Estado de México, ha sido interpretada por algunos analistas como un preámbulo un tanto desolador sobre lo que podría ocurrir en las elecciones de 2018, ante ""las amenazas que representa la parálisis de la derecha o el salto al vacío de la izquierda demagógica"" que enfrenta el PRI, tal como lo reconoció el presidente Enrique Peña Nieto en la celebración por el aniversario 88 del partido tricolor.

""Tantas veces que anunciamos la extinción del dinosaurio priista. Tantas ocasiones que celebramos su fin, sólo para despertar y encontrarlo todavía ahí. Violento, rapaz, omnívoro. Arrasando con todo a su paso, destructivo e imbatible. Ni el meteorito Fox, ni doce años de panismo y alternancia, ni la ineptitud del peñanietismo han logrado acabar con él. Aunque cojea, herido, en el Estado de México y en Veracruz y en Nayarit y en Coahuila, sobrevive. Persiste. Ruge. Sus acciones siguen pesando y reverberando como lo demuestra este ciclo electoral, marcado por las prácticas del pleistoceno"", escribió la politóloga Denise Dresser tras la elección en el Estado de México, en un texto titulado Jaula Jurásica.

""Es un partido de Estado, así nació. Ahora tiene menos poder, pero tiene la misma vocación. La sociedad mexicana, hoy a diferencia de lo que ocrurría en 1929, tiene que poner más atención y hacer todo un esfuerzo para poder romper esta liga entre partido y Estado que por lo visto Peña se propone mantener hasta donde sea posible"", señaló el historiador y politólogo Lorenzo Meyer.

De este modo, Meyer sostiene que Peña Nieto y el PRI pueden obtener un triunfo en 2018 al controlar la maquinaria burocrática que le daría una ventaja sobre sus adversarios.

""Es un presidente que está en la lona y sin embargo tiene el control de todo el aparato burocrático y recursos... que puede mandar para que quien sea su candidato tenga ventaja sobre el resto"", señaló en el preámbulo de la elección en el Estado de México.

Una opinión que en buena medida es compartida por el politólogo Jesús Silva-Herzog Márquez.

""El PRI sabe bien que no necesita ganar la mayoría, no necesita siquiera estar cerca de la mayoría. Necesita alcanzar el tercio mayor y está -en la peor fase del desprestigio- cerca del umbral. El PRI puede perder millones de votos y ganar. El PRI puede tener una gran mayoría en su contra y ganar. De ahí que al PRI no le interese ya hacer una convocatoria nacional. Ha renunciado a ella. No perderá el tiempo buscando votos imposibles. Le interesa cuidar sus lealtades"", señaló Silva-Herzog Márquez, tras la XXII Asamblea Nacional del PRI.

""En el México de la fragmentación política para el PRI es prescindible el resto de la sociedad mexicana"", sentenció el catedrático.

Un escenario preocupante ante el riesgo de una regresión autoritaria que incremente el descontento de la sociedad mexicana. De acuerdo con una reciente encuesta del Pew Research Center, el 93% de los mexicanos dijo sentirse insatisfecho con su sistema político. Una cifra aún más baja que la registrada en países como Venezuela.

Was war geschehen? Der letzte Bundestag hatte kurz vor seiner letzten Sitzung die Geschäftsordnung geändert. Bis dahin hatte immer der älteste Abgeordnete die erste Sitzung des Bundestages eröffnet.

Da bei einem Einzug der AfD diese Ehre einem AfD-Abgeordneten zuteil geworden wäre, beschloss man, dass der nächste Bundestag vom dienstältesten Abgeordneten eröffnet werden sollte und somit hatte Herr Solms von der FDP das Vergnügen.

Ich kann die Motivation hinter der Entscheidung nachvollziehen.

Man wollte Rechtspopulisten keine Bühne geben und nicht einer radikalen Minderheit die Eröffnung eines Parlamentes überlassen, in der ihr die übergroße Mehrheit mit derartiger Verachtung gegenübersteht, dass sie nicht einmal neben der AfD sitzen will.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Schäuble wiederholt in seiner ersten Rede immer wieder ein Wort - es zeigt, wie sich das Parlament verändert

Die AfD kritiserte das dann natürlich als undemokratisch. Soweit tat jeder, was von ihm erwartet wurde.

Danach aber passierte, was mich entsetzte. Herr Solms eröffnete den Bundestag mit einer Rede, in der er die Abgeordneten daran erinnerte, dass kein gewählter Abgeordneter und keine Fraktion ausgegrenzt werden dürfe, dass es keine Regeländerungen zu diesem Zwecke geben dürfe.

Ein Paradebeispiel für politische Schizophrenie

Der gesamte Bundestag applaudierte nach dieser Aussage und der gewogene Bürger konnte sich nur verwundert die Augen reiben. Wenn man ein Beispiel für politische Schizophrenie bräuchte, hier wäre man fündig geworden.

Da ändern Parteien die Regeln, um die AfD nicht zu Wort kommen zu lassen, ihr keine Bühne zu geben und dann mahnt der Nutznießer der Regeländerung, dass man dies nicht tun dürfe und alle geben ihm Recht.

Die AfD braucht gar nicht mehr darauf hinzuweisen, wie verlogen das politische Geschäft ist, was für eine Demokratie-Show die sogenannten Altparteien abziehen, wenn diese die Wähler für so dumm halten, dass offensichtliche Widersprüche in der Argumentation einfach in Kauf genommen werden.

Natürlich sieht jeder Bürger, dass die AfD ausgegrenzt wurde. Sich dann hinzustellen und so zu tun, als ob das nicht der Fall wäre, ist genau die Art von Heuchelei und Verlogenheit, die der AfD ihre Protestwähler zuführt, die gar nicht politisch rechts stehen müssen, um dort auch ihr Wahlkreuz zu machen.

Entweder grenzt man die AfD aus, dann aber auch in aller Konsequenz oder man tut es nicht, dann aber auch bitte überhaupt nicht.

Wenn es im Bundestag so weitergeht, wie nach der heutigen Eröffnung, wird die AfD die anderen Bundestagsabgeordneten vier Jahre lang vor sich hertreiben können, denn auch wenn das Eingeständnis bitter ist, intellektuell sind ihre Gegner der Situation nicht gewachsen.

Gates’ Role In The Trump CampaignGates also once played an integral role in the Trump campaign.","Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, was indicted on 12 counts Monday, including conspiracy against the United States, in connection with lobbying work for Ukraine uncovered by the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Manafort’s former lobbying business partner, Rick Gates, also was named in the indictment.

“Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work,” the indictment says. “In order to hide Ukraine payments from United States authorities, from approximately 2006 through at least 2016, Manafort and Gates laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and bank accounts.”

Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign in August 2016, after reports about his former business ties to Eastern Europe began to surface.

Pro-Russian Lobbying

Several business deals link Manafort to pro-Russian interests in the former Eastern bloc, according to the indictment. Manafort’s name reportedly appeared in a secret ledger used by the Party of Regions, the party of Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine.

And a firm he once ran ― which he didn’t register as a foreign agent as required by federal law ― allegedly helped orchestrate a pro-Russian lobbying effort on behalf of Ukraine. Manafort also has been linked with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash.

Manafort retroactively registered as a foreign agent and disclosed more than $17 million in payments for his firm’s consulting work in Ukraine from 2012 to 2014.

He set up shell companies in Cyprus to receive payments. Failing to pay taxes on this income awarded him a “lavish lifestyle in the United States,” according to the indictment, which says he “spent millions of dollars on luxury goods and services for himself and his extended family through payments wired from offshore nominee accounts to United States vendors.”

That Russia Meeting

Manafort met with Senate investigators in July about a meeting he attended the year before with members of the Trump family and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Donald Trump Jr. set up the meeting after being lured by the potential of receiving damaging material about Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Manafort passed along his notes from the meeting, igniting speculation about whether they contained references to Russian donations to the Trump campaign or the Republican Party. The FBI raided his home the next morning.

Gates’ Role In The Trump Campaign

Gates also once played an integral role in the Trump campaign. He took over after Manafort resigned, and later worked for America First Policies, a pro-Trump lobbying group.

Gates quit in April after authorities began investigating his ties to Manafort.

A big challenge for Jones with his 'udder cream' selling out quickly, was his business success coincided with the death of his mother.","Sally Cooper with daughter Belle are behind Tea&Belle, a website selling indigeneous products that quickly sold out almost as soon as it launched.

Sally Cooper's daughter Belle and her friend Tea wanted to know why there are no indigeneous brands in mainstream shops.

Ten year old Tea and eight year old Belle (Canberra girls, born in Wiradjuri Country) asked questions of Cooper that sparked an idea, leading to the creation of Tea&Belle - a website selling unique indigeneous products.

Tea and Belle are the inspiration behind Tea&Belle after they queried why there are no indigineous products in mainstream stores.

""Before we launched, we surveyed people on their knowledge of indigenous culture and imagine our surprise when 4,500 people got back to us,"" Cooper told HuffPost Australia.

""They told us they want to feel secure in the knowledge that if they purchase a product, they're not being seen as appropriating indigenous culture.""

Tea&Belle sells indigineous products, including Noongar words on colour pencils.

While the survey gave Cooper a good idea that there's a market for indigeneous products, she was blown away by how successful they were, as they launched on the eve of NAIDOC Week 2017.

""We didn't expect our first collection to sell out. It was a good issue to have but it proved a challenge to manage the amount of orders we had and we quickly needed to order more products,"" Cooper said.

The Tea&Belle Boab tree onesie was among other products that sold out quickly.

""We've now been approached by major brands to partner with us, so maybe the girls will see indigenous brands in mainstream shops in the future.""

Carla Oates had a 'pretty good feeling' that her business The Beauty Chef would be popular. Having suffered from eczema and allergies as a child, and then with knowledge gained during a career as a beauty writer, she believed in the connection between skin health and what you put in your body.

""The beauty industry can be very one dimensional and when I launched the Inner Beauty Powders range, I had a strong feeling that people would embrace natural skin care,"" Oates said.

Carla Oates the founder of The Beauty Chef, knew as a beauty writer about the connection between great skin and what we put inside our bodies.

In the last 18 months the Beauty Chef has launched in Anthropologie (US), Cat Beauty (US) and Selfridges (UK). The brand has also recently signed with SEPHORA US, with a range of powders in more than 200 stores.

""I wasn't too surprised that people embraced my business, though it wasn't entirely instant. I knew it would take time for people to understand the whole well-being revolution. Now there are categories for inner beauty and more studies are done about gut health and overall health,"" Oates said.

""My real 'Aha moment' was when I realised that healthy skin comes from within and that there were no mass market products that reflected this. I never really doubted my products for a second, because I knew they worked but it was still overwhelming when it all took off.""

Kirsten Carriol grew up on a remote sheep farm, knowing the importance of lanolin, derived from wool, which mimics human oils.

""It was something I grew up with, especially for chapped lips, and then it disappeared. Ultimately, people know lanolin and wanted to have it back. So, for me, it was a no brainer that Lanolips was a great business idea. I'd had dozens of ideas but this one I just knew, like an arrow to my heart, that it was right,"" Carriol told HuffPost Australia.

Carriol created Lano: a natural and simple lanolin lip and skincare. In November, Lanolips will be available in 15 countries, though she said it's been a very measured rise.

""My first big moment was when I had my original product sample and brand presentation to Priceline and David Jones. They were very intense meetings over two days and, at the end of the two days, I was told 'They all want it."" This was huge news because, a few years ago, you were really relying on retailers,"" Carriol said

Kirsten Carriol, founder of Lanolips, grew up on a remote sheep farm and always knew the importance of lanolin.

""If retailers didn't want your brand, then you didn't really have a business. So knowing retailers were onboard in the early days was a huge thing. It was so great to have that confidence in the brand, early in the life of the business.""

Craig Jones, the founder of MooGoo, was searching for a natural cream to help his mother with her psorisis. He decided to whip up a natural cream in his kitchen, as the only cream that had worked for his mum was a cream used on dairy cows.

Jones came up with his own version, the 'Udder Cream' using natural products and, once it cleared up his mother's skin condition, he was inundated with friends and family wanting it too.

Craig Jones, founder of MooGoo, sold out of his udder cream, which helps relieve the symptoms of psorisis. But the first rush of success coincided with the death of his mother, causing him to close the business for six months.

""I couldn't make enough of it. The cream I made for my mum didn't cure her Psoriasis, but it did make it fade to areas of redness rather than flaking and bleeding. And, for the first time, I got to see that something I could make was able to make a difference,"" Jones told HuffPost Australia.

Zuspruch kam aus der Wirtschaft, Kritik von der SPD

Kaum ist die große Koalition Geschichte, wird eines ihrer Rentenprojekte zerpflückt: die Rente mit 63.

CDU-Präsidiumsmitglied Jens Spahn verlangte in der ""Rheinischen Post"" ihre Abschaffung. Diese ""Form der Frühverrentung"" sollte auslaufen und das Geld lieber in die Renten von Witwen und Erwerbsgeminderten investiert werden, argumentierte er. ""Die Rente mit 63 für langjährig Versicherte wird vor allem von männlichen Facharbeitern genutzt, die wir eigentlich noch brauchen.""

IW-Direktor ist für die Abschaffung

Der Direktor des arbeitgebernahen Instituts der deutschen Wirtschaft (IW) Köln, Michael Hüther, sagte der ""Welt"", die Rente mit 63 müsse ""rückabgewickelt"" werden. Mehr als 200.000 Arbeitskräfte hätten deswegen schon zu arbeiten aufgehört – alles gut verdienende Menschen mit mittlerer und höherer Bildung.

""Wenn ich Grüne und FDP wäre, würde ich die Union da vor mir hertreiben"", sagte Hüther mit Blick auf die Jamaika-Sondierungen. Zudem müsse man darüber nachdenken, ab 2029 das Renteneintrittsalter auch über 67 Jahre hinaus zu erhöhen.

Nach Angaben der Deutschen Rentenversicherung Bund haben bis Ende August 160.000 Versicherte einen Antrag auf abschlagsfreie Rente mit 63 gestellt. Im Vorjahreszeitraum waren es noch 165.000.

Kritik von der SPD

Wer mindestens 45 Jahre in die Rentenversicherung eingezahlt hat, kann seit Juli 2014 ab 63 Jahren ohne Abschlag in Rente gehen. Allerdings wird diese Altersgrenze seitdem pro Jahr um zwei Monate angehoben, so dass die Jahrgänge ab 1964 erst mit 65 nach 45 Jahren abschlagsfrei in Renten gehen können. Die ""Rente mit 63"" ist insofern etwas missverständlich.

Die frühere Bundesfamilienministerin Manuela Schwesig (SPD) wies den Vorstoß Spahns zurück. ""Das zeigt, wie die CDU heute tickt. Da ist mehr soziale Kälte als soziale Verantwortung zu spüren"", sagte sie dem SWR.

Das Vorstandsmitglied des Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (DGB), Annelie Buntenbach, hielt Spahn entgegen: ""Wer die Rente mit 63 zurückdrehen will, ignoriert schlicht die Lebenswirklichkeit vieler Menschen. Wir brauchen nicht weniger Möglichkeiten für Beschäftigte, vor dem 67. Lebensjahr in Rente gehen zu können, sondern mehr."" Viele erreichten heute schon den regulären Rentenbeginn nicht.

Der Wirtschaftsrat der CDU sieht in einem Jamaika-Bündnis die große Chance, das SPD-Projekt der Rente mit 63 zu beerdigen, und unterstützt den Vorstoß Spahns.

Die Mütterrente

Die CSU wollte in den Jamaika-Sondierungen auch eine weitere Erhöhung der Mütterrente fordern. Dabei geht es um Mütter, deren Kinder vor 1992 geboren wurden. Sie sollen einen Rentenpunkt mehr bekommen und damit genauso viel wie Mütter, deren Kinder nach diesem Datum geboren wurden. Ein Rentenpunkt für diese Frauen kostet zwischen sechs und sieben Milliarden Euro.

Die Grünen-Fraktionsvorsitzende Katrin Göring-Eckardt sagte im ARD-""Morgenmagazin"": ""Für mich ist das Entscheidende, dass wir keine Altersarmut mehr haben."" Die Mütterrente sei dafür nicht das richtige Instrument. Besser wäre eine ""Garantierente"". Wer lange gearbeitet habe, solle mehr haben als die Grundsicherung.

Die Präsidentin des Sozialverbands VdK, Ulrike Mascher, forderte die vollständige Angleichung der Mütterrente sowie eine Stabilisierung des Rentenniveaus und dessen Anhebung auf 50 Prozent.

Dabei streiten wir nicht über die Lehren des Islam, sondern nur über Zerrbilder

Im Kampf gegen den Terrorismus kommt der Westen daher nicht weiter

Wenn mich jemand vor zehn Jahren gefragt hätte, ob die Deutschen jemals noch einmal zum Hass auf eine religiöse Minderheit fähig sein würden, hätte ich ihn für verrückt erklärt.

Das sogenannte ""Sommermärchen"" war gerade vorbei, die Bundesrepublik hatte den ""Partypatriotismus"" für sich entdeckt, eine Art Nationalstolz light, ohne die alten Konservierungsstoffe.

Und obwohl auch vor zehn Jahren schon Anzeichen für eine populärer werdende ""neue Bürgerlichkeit"" zu erkennen waren, war von allen denkbaren Themen die Religion am untauglichsten, um Massen zu mobilisieren.

Die Zeiten haben sich geändert. Spätestens seit dem 24. Oktober 2017 ist der Islamhass in der Mitte aller Debatten angekommen.

Wenn Islamhasser im Bundestag sitzen

An diesem Tag fand die konstituierende Sitzung des neuen Bundestages statt. Und inmitten der ersten rhetorisch-radikalen Anklänge von Seiten der AfD-Fraktion wurde klar, dass wir uns in Zukunft nicht mehr vor den Irren wegducken können.

Wenn Islamhasser im Bundestag sitzen, haben ihre Äußerungen so viel Gewicht, dass wir uns damit zumindest auseinandersetzen müssen.

Das ist zum Beispiel der hessische AfD-Politiker Albrecht Glaser. Er sollte nach dem Willen seiner Fraktion zum Vizepräsidenten des Deutschen Bundestags gewählt werden. Was nicht gelang. Glaser scheiterte in drei Wahldurchgängen.

Mitschuld daran dürfte ein Satz aus einer Wahlkampfrede Glasers sein. ""Der Islam ist eine Konstruktion, die selbst die Religionsfreiheit nicht kennt und die sie nicht respektiert. Und die da, wo sie das Sagen hat, jede Art von Religionsfreiheit im Keim erstickt. Und wer so mit einem Grundrecht umgeht, dem muss man das Grundrecht entziehen"", sagte Glaser im April.

Mit anderen Worten: Glaser möchte den Muslimen in Deutschland die Grundrechte einschränken. Überflüssig zu erwähnen, dass dies nicht geht, so lange das Grundgesetz in Kraft ist – Religionsfreiheit und die Gleichheit der Menschen vor dem Gesetz sind unabänderlich. Das ist eine Lehre aus der deutschen Geschichte.

Man darf ohne Übertreibung davon reden, dass Glasers Einlassungen sich direkt gegen die verfassungsmäßige Ordnung in Deutschland richten.

Wir streiten über Zerrbilder des Islam

Der Streit um Albrecht Glaser war nur die jüngste populistische Stilblüte in der Debatte darüber, wie man dem radikalen Islamismus in Deutschland wirkungsvoll entgegen treten kann.

Die diskursive Dominanz der Radikalen führt jedoch schon seit den Silvester-Übergriffen von Köln dazu, dass wir nicht mehr über die Bekämpfung des Radikalismus reden, sondern nur noch über Zerrbilder des Islam.

Nicht nur in der AfD wird der Islam bisweilen als ""Ideologie"" bezeichnet. Der Begriff signalisiert, dass Muslime sich keineswegs auf die Ausübung der Religionsfreiheit berufen können. Weil sie ja dieser Lesart folgend keiner Religion anhängen.

Es gibt gute Gründe, sich aus ethisch-moralischen Gründen darüber zu empören. Natürlich ist es dreist, intolerant, chauvinistisch und antidemokratisch, einer Gemeinschaft von über einer Milliarde Menschen das Recht absprechen zu wollen, einer Religion anzuhängen.

Vor allem aber ist es unfassbar ignorant und führt dazu, dass der Kampf gegen den Terrorismus in der westlichen Welt seit 16 Jahren nicht wesentlich vorwärts gekommen ist.

Wir müssen endlich verstehen lernen, was junge Menschen in die Arme der Radikalen treibt. Was sie dort suchen und finden. Und natürlich auch, wie Religion für politische Zwecke missbraucht wird.

Es dauerte nur drei Monate, bis Oliver radikalisiert war

Ich hatte die Gelegenheit, mit dem ehemaligen IS-Angehörigen Oliver N. ein Buch zu schreiben, das im Oktober unter dem Titel ""Meine falschen Brüder"" bei Kiepenheuer und Witsch erschienen ist.

Oliver war gerade 16 geworden, als ihn ein Freund aus Kindertagen in eine radikal-islamistische Gemeinde in Wien mitnahm. Es dauerte nur drei Monate, bis Oliver so weit radikalisiert war, dass er nach Syrien ausreiste, um dort beim Aufbau des ""Kalifats"" des sogenannten Islamischen Staates zu helfen.

""Sie sind sehr gut darin, Personen zu finden, die sich in einer schwierigen Lebenssituation befinden. Menschen, die auf einer Sinnsuche sind, die in schwierigen Verhältnissen leben oder einfach nicht wissen, wohin ihr Weg sie führt"", sagt Oliver.

""Ich traf viele Menschen in Syrien und im Irak, die an solchen Wendepunkten ihres Lebens in die radikalislamistische Ideologie abgerutscht sind. Leute, die den falschen Brüdern vertraut haben.""

Oliver selbst ist in schwierigen Verhältnissen aufgewachsen, lebte viele Jahre in Heimen und betreuten Wohngruppen. Obwohl er lange Schwierigkeiten in der Schule hatte, schaffte er einen guten Schulabschluss und bekam eine begehrte Lehrstelle bei einer Versicherung.

Es wäre so wichtig, über diese Prozesse zu reden

Genau in diesem Moment, als sein Leben in halbwegs geordnete Bahnen zu gehen schien, kam er mit dem radikalen Islamismus in Kontakt.

Mit Leuten, die sich aus Versatzstücken der islamischen Religion eine politische Weltanschauung gezimmert haben. Die sich auf dem Islam berufen und ihr Selbstwertgefühl daraus ziehen, dass sie sich für die einzig wahren Gläubigen halten.

Es wäre so wichtig, über diese Prozesse endlich einmal zu reden: Wie geraten junge Menschen in die Fänge von radikalen Islamisten? Was lässt sie immer tiefer in den Strudel der Realitätsentfremdung geraten?

Leute wie Albrecht Glaser werden uns darauf keine Antworten geben können, weil es ihnen einzig darum geht, ganze Bevölkerungsgruppen pauschal zu verunglimpfen.

""Religion ist das wichtigste Mittel, um radikale Ideologen zu bekämpfen“

Oliver wurde in Syrien bei einem Raketenangriff schwer verwundet. Es gelang ihm auf abenteuerlichen Wegen, in die Türkei auszureisen.

In Wien wurde ihm der Prozess gemacht, er saß 20 Monate im Gefängnis und engagiert sich heute für einen Verein, der jungen Muslimen im Prozess der Deradikalisierung zur Seite steht.

""Eine österreichische Journalistin hat einmal gesagt, dass der Islam nicht die Lösung im Kampf gegen den Terror sei. Ich glaube, das Gegenteil ist richtig. Religion ist das wichtigste Mittel, um radikale Ideologen zu bekämpfen"", sagt Oliver.

""Wir müssen die Lügen der Extremisten richtigstellen, wo immer sie uns begegnen. Und wir werden das nur schaffen, wenn wir dabei mit den islamischen Gemeinden zusammenarbeiten. Imame müssen besser geschult werden. Auch innerhalb der Gemeinden muss ein stärkeres Bewusstsein dafür geschaffen werden, wo Radikalisierung anfängt. Es ist nicht normal, wenn junge Männer anfangen, ihre Freundeslisten bei Facebook von weiblichen Kontakten zu säubern. Das weiß ich aus eigener Erfahrung.""

Oliver ist übrigens immer noch Muslim. Er glaubt an eine Religion der Toleranz, Hilfsbereitschaft und des Friedens. So wie der allergrößte Teil der Muslime auf dieser Welt auch. Sie sollten im Kampf gegen den Terrorismus unsere wichtigsten Verbündeten werden.

Oinky the giant pig will have to leave his family's Gold Coast home within for weeks, the council has decided.

The Gold Coast City Council has decided that Oinky breaks the law because he is living on land of a size smaller than one acre. Local law dictates that ""a permit is required to keep an animal"" like Oinky, and due to a neighbour's complaint that law has been strictly enforced.

One and a half-year-old Oinky was originally bought as a therapy pet for Jacob Fellows, who has autism and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Speaking to Seven News, Jacob said that the 170-kilogram pig means a lot to him.





""I like to help him, you know, make sure he doesn't forget about me,"" he said, ""He saves my life"".

Jacob's mother Donna Fellows even shared that ""there's been times when Oinky has actually cried with Jacob"".

In the months before the local council decision, a 'Save Oinky' campaign was launched on Facebook by Jacob's brother.

The Australian government will combine with non-government organisations to give more than $100 million in the fight to increase brain cancer survival rates.



The government will put up $50 million, which will be coordinated with a $20 million pledge from the Cure Brain Cancer Foundation and $10 million from Andrew Forrest's Minderoo Foundation. The remaining $20 million will come from another philanthropic group which has yet to publicly announce its support.

The investment will be used by the Eliminate Cancer Initiative with the aim of developing ""an innovative 'road map' that aims to double survival rates in patients with brain tumours,"" it was explained in a statement released by the Minderoo Foundation.

Forrest, who established the Minderoo Foundation with wife Nicola, made headlines earlier this year by announcing he would donate $400 million of his wealth to charity. It was the biggest single philanthropic donation in Australia's history.

""I can't imagine anything more devastating than being told that your child, a friend or family member not only has cancer but one of the deadliest forms of all, brain cancer -- a disease that right now, claims a disproportioned and unfair number of kid's lives across Australia every day,"" Forrest said.

Speaking in Melbourne, Health Minister Greg Hunt said that the new injection of funds could see a breakthrough.



""Now is the moment when we have the opportunity with the new targeted therapies and immunotherapies, with the new proton beam therapy and other treatments, where we can have a real breakthrough in brain cancer.""

The disease has seen little progress in the past few decades -- currently, only two patients of every 10 survive beyond five years once being diagnosed with brain cancer. But Forrest has hope that this investment can change that.

""It is our collective belief that soon, when an Australian is diagnosed with brain cancer, their family can know their loved one has a real chance at life,"" Forrest said.

Rose McGowan n'avait donc jamais associé le nom d'Harvey Weinstein à celui de son agresseur.
Jusqu'à ce que le New Yorker ne le dévoile.","AFFAIRE WEINSTEIN - Au mois de septembre, l'actrice Rose McGowan a refusé l'offre d'un proche de Harvey Weinstein qui lui proposait de se taire sur son agression sexuelle contre 1 million de dollars, rapporte le New York Times, dans un article paru le 28 octobre.

Dans un premier temps, l'actrice de la série ""Charmed"" avait alors refusé l'offre de 1 million de dollars, faisant une contre-proposition de 6 millions de dollars contre son silence. L'actrice avait finalement demandé à son avocat de retirer cette contre-proposition.

""Toutes les personnes qui travaillaient pour moi me disaient d'accepter l'offre, que je pourrai financer mes projets. Mais je me suis dit :""Hey grosse brute, tu me dégoûtes, je ne veux pas ton argent. Cela me ferait sentir dégoûtante"", déclare-t-elle dans une interview au New York Times.

Au début du mois d'octobre, le New York Times publiait un long article qui faisait état de nombreuses accusations d'harcèlement sexuel contre Harvey Weinstein. Quelques jours plus tard, c'était au tour du New Yorker de dénoncer les agissements du producteur, allants d'un comportement inapproprié jusqu'au viol.

En 1997, Rose McGowan avait déjà accusé Harvey Weinstein de l'avoir violée dans une chambre d'hôtel alors qu'elle n'avait que 20 ans. Suite à cela -et pour garantir le silence de sa jeune victime- l'actrice avait reçu un chèque de 100.000 dollars de la part de l'ex-producteur.

Mais jusqu'à cet été, McGowan ignorait que l'arrangement avec Weinstein ne comprenait pas de clause de confidentialité. Elle a donc longtemps parlé publiquement d'une agression sexuelle subie par un puissant producteur hollywoodien, sans pour autant citer qui que ce soit. Rose McGowan n'avait donc jamais associé le nom d'Harvey Weinstein à celui de son agresseur. Jusqu'à ce que le New Yorker ne le dévoile.

Les accords à l'amiable ouvertement critiqués

Les accords à l'amiable avec les victimes présumées sont aujourd'hui accusés d'avoir prolongé l'omerta, en raison des clauses de confidentialité qu'ils comportent. Dans l'affaire Weinstein, ces dernières ont ""clairement joué un très grand rôle puisqu'on voit qu'il y a eu de nombreux accords amiables dans lesquels des femmes auraient pu porter plainte pour harcèlement sexuel ou parler publiquement"", constate Ariela Gross, professeure de droit à l'université USC en Californie.

De nombreuses victimes ont reçu des sommes d'argent importantes pour acheter de facto leur silence, comme l'a raconté dans le Financial Times une ex-collaboratrice du producteur déchu, Zelda Perkins. ""Je veux publiquement briser mon accord de confidentialité"" car sans cela ""il n'y aura pas de débat sur ces accords scandaleux"", affirme-t-elle.

Plusieurs dizaines d'employés de la Weinstein Company, fondée par le producteur et son frère Bob, ont également diffusé une lettre ouverte dans laquelle ils affirment prendre le risque d'enfreindre leur accord de confidentialité pour se défendre d'avoir eu connaissance de son comportement de ""prédateur sexuel"".

Das weiß ich alles nicht, was ich aber sicher weiß, ist das mein Schweigen ihn in seiner Sicht bestätigt.
Das macht mich nicht zu einem schlechten Menschen, aber sicher auch nicht zu einem guten.","Es gibt Momente im Leben, wo das eigene Selbstbild plötzlich völlig in Frage gestellt wird. Momente, wo fast alles, woran man geglaubt hat, sich als falsch erweist.

So einen Moment hatte ich vor Kurzem in der U-Bahn.

Ich dachte eigentlich immer von mir, dass ich ein offener Mensch sei. Liberal, aber gegen Rassismus, würde ich für meine Werte einstehen und diese - wenn nötig - auch verteidigen.

Jetzt weiß ich, dass ich falsch lag.

Ich war vor ein paar Tagen in der U-Bahn unterwegs. Autofahren war nie so mein Ding und die Dellen in meinem alten Wagen geben mir da recht. Daher habe ich schon seit Jahren eine Monatskarte.

Als ein gekünstelt freundliches ""Servus, die Fahrscheine bitte!"" durch den Wagon gerufen wurde, war ich daher auch wenig beunruhigt.

Routiniert zeigte ich mein Ticket, der Kontrolleur schaute ebenso routiniert drauf und wandte sich dem älteren Ehepaar mir gegenüber zu, die es mir gleich taten. So ging es dann immer weiter, ein Fahrgast nach dem anderen.

So weit, so unspektakulär.

""Das ist typisch bei denen. Die Schwarzen denken, hier ist alles umsonst""

Plötzlich kam es zu einer Unterbrechung. Ein dunkelhäutiges Paar mit Kinderwagen hatte offensichtlich keine Fahrkarte dabei. Beide sprachen kein Deutsch, waren sich aber augenscheinlich bewusst, um was es ging.

Die Frau schien verunsichert, dem Mann war es wohl einfach nur sehr peinlich.

Die Bayern sind für ihre grantige Art bekannt und der Kontrolleur, der keine Anstalten machte, es auch auf Englisch zu versuchen, war hier keine Ausnahme. Er war nicht beleidigend, hatte aber diese typisch ruppige Art, die man entweder liebt oder eben nicht.

Der Kontrolleur wollte den Ausweis sehen, der Mann verstand nicht und hielt sein geöffnetes Portemonnaie hin. Vielleicht dachte er, man könne im Zug nachzahlen, oder er wollte direkt die Strafe zahlen, vielleicht auch etwas ganz Anderes - das kann ich nicht genau sagen, denn meine Aufmerksamkeit wurde unterbrochen.

""Das ist typisch bei denen. Die Schwarzen denken, hier ist alles umsonst - aber das stimmt nicht.""

Dieser Satz kam von dem älteren Mann, der gegenüber in meinem Vierersitz saß. Er sagte das zu niemandem im Besonderen, aber in diesem speziellen Ton, der zeigt, dass ihn alle in der Bahn hören sollten. Auch der Kontrolleur und der schwarze Mann.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An die Neonazis neben mir in der U-Bahn

Ich weiß nicht, was es war. War es Peinlichkeit? Oder war es Angst? Schwer zu sagen. Auf jeden Fall war ich baff.

Der Mann ist in einem ganz gut besuchten U-Bahn-Abteil, umringt von Menschen, in einer der reichsten Städte Deutschlands, und hat keinerlei Vorbehalte, seine rassistischen Pauschalaussagen laut auszusprechen.

Er legte sogar noch nach.

""Natürlich mit Kind. Die vermehren sich rasant. Und das gibt auch mehr Mitleid.""

Die Bahn hielt, die Tür öffnete sich, der Kontrolleur und die Familie stieg aus, um die Sache weiter außerhalb des Zugs zu klären und wir fuhren wieder los.

Die Situation war vorbei, der Mann hatte seinen Teil gesagt und alle, inklusive mir, haben geschwiegen.

Ich weiß genau, was mein Schweigen anrichtete

Ich saß noch zwei weitere Stationen dem Mann gegenüber, habe starr aus dem Fenster in die Dunkelheit der U-Bahn-Schächte geschaut, bis ich ausgestiegen bin.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An die Münchnerin im Bus, die sich nicht von einem türkischen Jungen helfen lassen wollte

Mit schnellen Schritten ging ich nach Hause, klappte meinen Laptop auf und startete die erstbeste Serie auf Netflix. Schnell den Kopf mit irgendwelchen belanglosen Kram füllen, um nicht darüber nachzudenken, was eigentlich gerade passiert war.

Das hat für den ersten Moment auch funktioniert, aber nicht dauerhaft. Denn ich weiß genau, was mein Schweigen anrichtete.

Ein offensichtlicher Rassist hat in einer Gruppe von ca. 60 Mitfahrern seinen Hass verbreitet. Den Grund für seine Haltung kennen ich nicht. Vielleicht hat er schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht, vielleicht fällt er auf rechte Medien rein, vielleicht ist er so erzogen worden. Das weiß ich alles nicht, was ich aber sicher weiß, ist das mein Schweigen ihn in seiner Sicht bestätigt.

Niemand hat ihm widersprochen. Er hat laut seine Meinung gesagt und 60 Menschen haben kein Widerwort gegeben.

In seinem Kopf ist klar, was das bedeutet. Wenn er Unrecht gehabt hätte, hätte ihm doch wer widersprochen. Hat aber niemand, also müssen ja alle seiner Meinung sein.

Ich wollte mutig sein, aber habe versagt

Wenn ich auf Facebook Kommentare lese, wie ""die meisten Deutschen wachen ja jetzt auf"", ""die Mehrheit der Deutschen ist gegen die ausländischen Besatzer"" oder Klassiker wie ""wir sind das Volk"", ""wir sind Bürger, keine Nazis"", dann kommt das genau von solchen Situationen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich bin dunkelhäutig und Deutsche - trotzdem werde ich oft wie eine Fremde behandelt

Der Mann glaubt jetzt, dass die meisten Leute so denken wir er.

Auch wundert es nicht, wenn die Rechten in den Medien und sozialen Netzwerken so stark vertreten sind.

Natürlich schreiben die Nachrichtenseiten öfters über den neuen Hass-Tweet von irgendeinem AfD-Politiker als über die tolle Antwort der Nazi-Gegner. Denn viel zu selten kommt eine Antwort.

Ich mache mir keine Illusionen. Die politische Lage in Deutschland hätte sich nicht verändert, wenn ich etwas gesagt hätte. Wahrscheinlich hätte ich nicht mal den Mann in der U-Bahn umstimmen können.

Es hätte aber ein Zeichen sein können. An den Mann, dass nicht alle seiner Meinung sind und an alle in der Bahn, wie einfach es ist, ""Nein"" zu sagen.

Nein.

Früher habe ich laut Konstantin Weckers ""Sage Nein!"" gesungen.

""Ob du sechs bist oder hundert,

sei nicht nur erschreckt, verwundert,

tobe, zürne, misch dich ein

sage nein!""

Ich habe mir vor einiger Zeit vorgenommen, mutiger zu sein. Als die Chance sich bot, habe ich versagt. Das macht mich nicht zu einem schlechten Menschen, aber sicher auch nicht zu einem guten.

Als die beiden in der Küche sind, wird es heiß

Bauer Klaus sprüht in der aktuellen Folge ""Bauer sucht Frau"" nur so vor Testosteron, denn die thailändische Kandidatin Tiwaporn hat es ihm angetan. So heißt sie übrigens wirklich. Eigentlich ganz leicht zu merken: Nicht Youporn, sondern Tiwaporn.

Tiwaporn scheint sich ebenfalls zu Klaus hingezogen zu fühlen. Das liegt allerdings auch an den Tricks, die der listige Bauer anwendet. Als die beiden den Stall ausmisten, erklärt Klaus seiner Tiwaporn noch einmal ganz genau, wie das mit der Mistgabel funktioniert. Dazu stellt er sich natürlich hinter Tiwaporn und hilft ihr von hinten beim Führen der Mistgabel. Das ist schließlich gar nicht so einfach.

""Ich habe bei Tiwaporn den Tennislehrer-Trick angewendet"", erklärt er den RTL-Reportern. Tatsächlich ist der Trick Tennis-Spielerinnen nur allzu bekannt. Denn der ein oder andere Lehrer stellt auf ähnliche Weise gerne mal seine Lehrer-Qualitäten unter Beweis - vor allem in klischeehaften Filmen. Oder eben bei ""Bauer sucht Frau"".

Klaus: ""Wie Händchen halten, nur mit Mistgabel""

""Auf diese Weise komme ich Tiwaporn näher"", erklärt Klaus sein ausgefuchstes Vorgehen. ""Das ist wie Händchen halten, nur eben mit einer Mistgabel.""

Und es funktioniert. Tiwaporn ist ganz hingerissen vom intimen Stall-Ausmisten. Als die beiden schließlich in die Küche gehen, wird es richtig heiß. Denn sie gehen Klaus' liebstem Hobby nach: Bauernbrot backen.

Bewundernd sieht Tiwaporn zu, wie leidenschaftlich der Bauer seinen Teig knetet. ""Schneller!"", befiehlt sie. Klaus gehorcht zunächst - doch dann greift er zu einem weiteren gewieften Trick: Er beginnt, Tiwaporn zu bestäuben. Das ist natürlich wörtlich gemeint.

Der flirtbegabte Bauer greift sich eine Hand voll Mehl und stäubt die Thailänderin ein. Sie kichert und die Bestäubung nimmt ihren Lauf.

Und auch das Bauernbrot ist ein voller Erfolg: Sehr knackig und sehr braun (also gut, ein bisschen verbrannt) kommt es aus dem Ofen. Jetzt fehlen eigentlich nur noch die Kinder. Bis dahin müssen die beiden das ganze Bauernbrot allein vernaschen.

Even his most ardent admirer would concede that Rahul Gandhi is no orator. He comes across as the master of the faux pas, the mangler of metaphors, a Muggle flailing against the political wizardry of a Modi-Shah combo. Some have even joked that he is the BJP's greatest asset. BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao once said Rahul Gandhi is a sure shot route for achieving his party's Congress-mukt (Congress-free) Bharat claim.

But these days the BJP might be the one helping Rahul, never a stellar performer on the campaign trail. The big guns of the ruling party are spending a lot of time training their ammunition on a man whom they have routinely dismissed as a political non-entity. In the process they are inadvertently granting Rahul what he has sorely needed — some political gravitas. They are making him someone to reckon with.

His recent speeches in the US at first spawned mocking memes because it was reported he was going to talk about Artificial Intelligence. The BJP could have just ignored him because in the end what did it matter how he performed in a lecture hall at a university in the US. Instead they sent in their heavyweights to attack him as a ""failed dynast"". Amit Shah, Smriti Irani and Ravi Shankar Prasad all took turns to go after Rahul. Prasad complained that Rahul had broken a tradition of not talking about domestic politics overseas. Shah said nobody listens to Rahul in India anyways oddly proving that he was listening. Irani complained Rahul was belittling the Prime Minister abroad. In the process they managed to make more people pay attention to what had been in essence an interaction with university students, not even as much drama as Modi's Facebook townhall or Madison Square Garden speech.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends a Townhall a Townhall meeting, at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on September 27, 2015.

Rahul's latest barb calling GST the Gabbar Singh Tax clearly got under the BJP's skin. As Vijay's Mersal has shown, the ruling party is quite thin-skinned about GST anyway. Arun Jaitley has retorted that the GST crack proves that the Congress is scared of a legitimate tax system, that the party of 2G and coal scams only wants a cash economy. Actually what it really proves is that two can play the acronym game.

Narendra Modi is the master of the acronym. There's nothing he cannot acronym-ize. Some have been his attempt to make government programmes and goals pithy — JAM (Jandhan Aadhar Mobile), SMART (Strict and Sensitive, Modern and Mobile, Alert and Accountable, Reliable and Responsive, Technosavvy and Trained police force) and PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation). But his acronyms have had their greatest sting when he targets them at his opponents. And the Congress has been often the butt of the acronym.

During the Uttar Pradesh election Modi warned against SCAM — Samajwadi, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati. In 2014 he defined the Congress party as ABCD — Adarsh, Bofors, Coal and Daamaad (son-in-law). He even had a little shorthand for the Gandhi parivaar — RSVP or Rahul, Sonia, Vadra and Priyanka.

Despite an occasional humdinger like the ""suit-boot ki sarkar"" after Modi was photographed in his monogrammed suit, Rahul is better known for the plodding metaphor talking about Dalit empowerment in terms of the escape velocities of earth and Jupiter. ""In Hindustan we have the concept of caste. Dalits need Jupiter's escape velocity on earth."" That Rahul (or his team) have come up with an acronym that draws blood shows that Rahul is learning a few tricks from his foes.

Congress party Vice President Rahul Gandhi speaks during a roadshow in Allahabad, India, Thursday, Sept. 15, 2016.

Rahul has a steep learning curve. He got on social media way too late, long after Narendra Modi had turned it into a powerful weapon for his party. Rahul can only play catch-up. That the BJP now complains about Congress bots online and fake accounts is quite funny. Rajyavardhan Rathore, tweeted: ""In sports, this would come under 'Doping'... hey wait?? Does 'dope' remind you of someone?""

Now the BJP is calling Congress a 'Dramebaaz party Number 1'. Ravi Shankar Prasad said Rahul is ""yet to understand the serious dynamics of economics and development"" and was resorting to gimmickry in a desperate bid to stay relevant. He said Rahul needed to do his homework. But in reality, it's Rahul who has been far too serious and far too earnest for too long, the dutiful student reluctantly completing his homework assignments. But his earnest Harry Potter image was not working well against his opponent's sly and sarcastic jibes calling him ""young leader"" just learning to give speeches.

He told a meeting in Vadodara, ""I am thankful to the BJP because the defeat in 2014 Lok Sabha elections was greatest thing that happened to me. BJP had beaten me and abused me so much. It opened up my eyes."" Perhaps he has also learned a little humour goes a long way in the battle of social media. A little drama goes even further.

""In Hindustan we have the concept of caste. Dalits need Jupiter's escape velocity on earth."" Rahul Gandhi

It's not that Rahul has not tried drama before. His famous intervention at the Press Club in Delhi tearing up an ordinance shielding tainted MPs was high drama indeed. Unfortunately for the Congress it was a bit of self-goal for the party since its own man Manmohan Singh was at the helm at that time. But Narendra Modi is the master of drama and can milk a pregnant pause in a speech like no other. He can even make drama about an appearance at a Teachers Day event turning it into must-watch TV.

He has turned tearful talking about demonetization which was unrolled with all the ""surgical strike"" drama of a Bollywood action thriller. ""They may ruin me but I'm prepared,"" he said in best martyr-style. Left leader Brinda Karat called it naatakbaazi (drama). When Modi teared up at his Facebook townhall, All India Mahila Congress president Shobha Oza called him a big ""drama king"". Some would say that the BJP calling Rahul Gandhi a dramabaaz is actually a compliment. The ""young leader"" is at least learning about the theatrics of politics.

None of this might make much difference to the Congress' prospects, whether in Gujarat or beyond. Any reinvention of Rahul Gandhi is a tough call after all these years. But it's amusing to see the BJP reacting with such indignation to Rahul Gandhi's newfound penchant for a little drama and acronyms.

He has learned from the best. This is a leaf taken right out of Narendra Modi's playbook.

Mit ""House of Cards"" knüpfte Kevin Spacey endlich wieder an große Erfolge an - die komplette fünfte Staffel gibt es hier!

Als Kind von der Schauspielerei fasziniert

Kevin Spacey wurde in South Orange, New Jersey geboren. Durch die häufigen Jobwechsel seines Vaters musste die Familie häufig umziehen, wie es unter anderem auf der offiziellen Homepage des Schauspielers heißt. Bereits früh habe er sich für die Schauspielerei interessiert, da er heimlich nachts Filme angesehen habe.

Er versuchte sich zunächst als Comedian

Erste Schauspielerfahrungen machte Spacey an der Highschool. Nach dem Abschluss versuchte er sich einige Jahre lang als Stand-up-Comedian. Offenbar nicht mit dem gewünschten Erfolg. Denn es zog Spacey schließlich an die renommierte Juilliard School in New York, wo er ab 1979 Schauspiel studierte. Im Frühling 1981 verließ er die Schule ohne ein Diplom.

Alles begann am Theater

Zunächst blieben die Engagements aus und Spacey schlug sich zum Beispiel als Angestellter in einem Theater durch. Doch die klammen Jahre hatten ein Ende, als eines Tages ein Angebot vom Theater kam. Kurz darauf zog Spacey weiter an den Broadway und feierte dort erste Erfolge. 1991 heimste er einen Tony Award für seine Darbietung im Stück ""Lost in Yonkers"" ein.

Er hat zwei Oscars

Seinen weltweiten Durchbruch feierte Spacey dann auf der Kino-Leinwand. 10 Jahre nach seinem ersten Film ""Sodbrennen"" (1986) bekam er seinen ersten Oscar verliehen. Für seine Leistung in Bryan Singers (52) ""Die üblichen Verdächtigen"" wurde Spacey als ""Bester Nebendarsteller"" ausgezeichnet. Nur vier Jahre später folgte der Oscar als ""Bester Hauptdarsteller"" im Drama ""American Beauty"".

Er erlebt seinen zweiten Frühling

Nach seinem zweiten Oscar-Gewinn konnte Spacey mit seinen folgenden Filmen nicht mehr an den ganz großen Erfolg anknüpfen. Er konzentrierte sich fortan verstärkt auf seine alte Liebe - das Theater. Durch die Netflix-Serie ""House of Cards"" sorgt Spacey seit 2013 wieder weltweit für Schlagzeilen. Spacey wurde fünf Jahre in Folge für einen Emmy nominiert. 2015 gewann er den Golden Globe als ""Bester Hauptdarsteller in einer Dramaserie"" für seine Darstellung des skrupellosen Francis ""Frank"" Underwood.

Spacey sammelt Ehrentitel

Spacey trägt übrigens einige Ehrentitel. So bekam er im November 2005 zum Beispiel den Ehrendoktortitel als Doctor of Letters von der London South Bank University verliehen. Außerdem erhielt der Schauspieler 2010 den britischen Verdienstorden Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Für seine Verdienste um das Londoner Old Vic Theatre, bei dem er von 2003 bis 2015 als künstlerischer Leiter tätig war, wurde er zudem von Queen Elizabeth II. ehrenhalber zum Knight Commander of the British Empire ernannt.

La manifestation a envahi l'une des avenues emblématiques de Barcelone, le Paseig de Gracia, inondée de drapeaux espagnols et où résonnait le slogan ""Puigdemont, en prison!"", en référence au président indépendantiste catalan destitué vendredi par Madrid.

Elle a rassemblé environ 300.000 personnes, selon la police municipale, 1,3 million selon les organisateurs, et 1 million selon la préfecture, représentant l'Etat en Catalogne. ""Votarem, votarem"", (nous voterons) scandaient dimanche les manifestants, en reprenant à leur compte le slogan des indépendantistes en faveur d'un référendum d'autodétermination.

Carles Puigdemont a appelé samedi ses partisans à s'opposer pacifiquement à l'Etat, qui tente de reprendre le contrôle après la déclaration d'indépendance de vendredi. Oriol Junqueras, son numéro deux, a insisté, dimanche, assurant dans une tribune que Puigdemont ""est et restera le président"" de la Catalogne. Il a dit ne pas reconnaître les décisions prises par Madrid, qui a mis sous tutelle la région.

""La Catalogne, c'est nous tous!"", disait le slogan de la manifestation à l'appel de l'association Société civile catalane, opposée à la sécession, qui avait déjà organisé une manifestation le 8 octobre avec plusieurs centaines de milliers de personnes. Un des organisateurs du rassemblement, Alex Ramos, a fustigé ""une déclaration unilatérale d'indépendance illégale et illégitime"" comme ""une folie qui nous a conduits au précipice"".

Il a rappelé que les partis indépendantistes n'avaient obtenu que 47% des voix aux dernières élections régionales de 2015. Les séparatistes sont majoritaires au parlement catalan, avec 72 sièges sur 135, par le jeu de la pondération des voix en faveur des régions les plus rurales.

Le gouvernement espagnol du conservateur de Mariano Rajoy avait alors déjà reçu l'autorisation du Sénat de mettre en oeuvre l'article 155 de la Constitution, pour prendre en direct les rênes de la région et y ""restaurer l'ordre constitutionnel"". La numéro deux de son gouvernement, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, a été désignée pour diriger la Catalogne. Madrid a dans la foulée dissous le parlement catalan et convoqué des élections dans la région pour le 21 décembre.

La manifestation avait d'ailleurs des airs de pré-campagne électorale, avec les représentants des trois partis prônant le maintien de la région au sein de l'Espagne: Ciudadanos (libéral), le Parti socialiste catalan et le Parti populaire de Rajoy - très minoritaire en Catalogne, avec 8,5% aux dernières élections régionales. Selon un sondage du quotidien espagnol El Mundo dimanche, les indépendantistes perdraient la majorité en décembre, en n'obtenant au maximum que 65 des 135 sièges.

Le défi institutionnel posé par les indépendantistes est sans précédent depuis que l'Espagne a retrouvé la démocratie en 1977, même si elle a aussi été secouée pendant près de 40 ans par les violences liées à la lutte armée de l'organisation séparatiste basque ETA, tenue pour responsable de plus de 800 morts et qui a renoncé à la violence il y a tout juste six ans.

Τραμπ: «ΚΑΜΙΑ ΣΥΝΩΜΟΣΙΑ!»

Ο Τραμπ αντέδρασε μέσω twitter λέγοντας ότι δεν υπήρξε «καμία συνωμοσία» μεταξύ της ομάδας του και της Ρωσίας.

«Δεν υπάρχει ΚΑΜΙΑ ΣΥΝΩΜΟΣΙΑ!», έγραψε. «Λυπάμαι, αυτά συνέβησαν πριν από χρόνια, προτού ο Πολ Μάναφορτ συμμετάσχει στην εκστρατεία Τραμπ. Γιατί η διεφθαρμένη Χίλαρι και οι Δημοκρατικοί δεν βρέθηκαν στο στόχαστρο;» συμπλήρωσε ο Τραμπ.

Ο Αμερικανός πρόεδρος υποστήριξε ότι τα όσα καταλογίζονται στον Μάναφορτ εκτυλίχθηκαν πριν από τη θητεία του στην προεκλογική εκστρατεία του Τραμπ το 2016, ωστόσο στο κατηγορητήριο αναφέρεται ότι οι παράνομες δραστηριότητές του συνεχίστηκαν το 2017.

Diese 10 Bilder machen das Ausmaß der Schäden deutlich

Abgedeckte Häuser, umgestürzte Baugerüste, überflutete Straßen: Sturmtief ""Herwart"" hat am Wochenende Europa verwüstet. Mehrere Menschen starben, zwei von ihnen auch in Deutschland.

Als der Sturm abflaute, begann vielerorts das große Aufräumen. Die Deutsche Bahn stoppte am Sonntag in sieben Bundesländern ihren Fernverkehr, weitergehen soll es erst wieder am Montag.

Bilder zeigen versperrte Straßen und beschädigte Häuser. Diese 10 Fotos machen deutlich, wie schwer ""Herwart"" in Europa gewütet hat.

► Herwart hat auf einer Straße in Sachsen-Anhalt zahlreiche Bäume entwurzelt. Dieses Foto zeigt das zerbeulte Schild des Weiler Drei Annen bei Wernigerode:

► Auch in Bayern verursachte der Sturm mehrere hundert Feuerwehreinsätze. Abgebrochene Äste lagen auf den Straßen:

In Osteuropa starben mehrere Menschen. In Polen kam ein Mann bei einem sturmbedingten Autounfall ums Leben.

In Tschechien wurde eine Frau bei einem Waldspaziergang bei Trebic (Trebitsch) von einem Baum erschlagen. Ein Mann starb, als er in der böhmischen Kleinstadt Jicin (Jitschin) von einem Baum getroffen wurde, wie die Agentur CTK berichtete.

Hunderttausende Haushalte waren in ganz Tschechien ohne Strom, weil Freileitungen beschädigt wurden.

► Dieses Foto zeigt, wie der Sturm ein Blechdach eines Hauses in Tschechien aufgerollt hat:

► ""Herwart"" zerstörte auch eine sieben Jahre alte orthodoxe Holzkirche im tschechischen Most. Das komplette Dach liegt neben dem Kirchenschiff:

Auch in Österreich hinterließ der Sturm schwere Schäden.

► Hier befreien Feuerwehrleute im österreichischen Roitham bei Gmunden eine Straße von umgefallenen Bäumen und herabgestürzten Ästen:

Wegen der schweren Schäden durch Sturm ""Herwart"" kann die Deutsche Bahn den Betrieb wichtiger Strecken im Fernverkehr erst am Montag wieder aufnehmen.

► Zahlreiche Reisende strandeten am Sonntag daher im Hauptbahnhof in Hamburg:

Ein Mann starb auf einem Campingplatz in Niedersachsen. Er übernachtete in einem Bulli und wollte sich beim Herannahen des Wassers zu fuß in Sicherheit bringen, erklärte die Polizei.

Der 59 Jahre alte Bruder konnte sich noch an einem Mast festhalten. Er wurde am frühen Morgen von einer DLRG-Schlauchbootbesatzung gerettet und unterkühlt in ein Krankenhaus gebracht. Der 63-Jährige wurde wenig später tot geborgen.

► Dieses Foto zeigt den überflutete Campingplatz:

Der Wind erreichte Geschwindigkeiten von bis zu 176 Kilometer pro Stunde am Fichtelberg und 144 Kilometer pro Stunde auf Fehmarn. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern brachte “Herwart” wesentlich stärkere Orkanböen als sein Vorgänger “Xavier” Anfang Oktober, beispielsweise 140,8 Stundenkilometer über Hiddensee-Dornbusch, wie der Meteorologe Uwe Ulbrich vom Wetterstudio Hiddensee sagte.



Der Wind wird sich in Deutschland zu Wochenbeginn wieder abschwächen, zugleich fallen die Temperaturen. In der Nacht zum Montag sollte es bis auf 600 Meter hinunter schneien, wie der Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) am Sonntag in Offenbach mitteilte. Am Montag bleibt es überwiegend trocken.

vergangene Woche stieg ich nach einem langen Arbeitstag in den Zug. Sie setzten sich neben mich. Sie sprachen mich an und ich warf Ihnen einen abweisenden Blick zu. Ich war nicht in der Stimmung für Smalltalk.

""Kommen Sie aus Stuttgart?"", fragten Sie mich und deuteten auf meine Tasche, die tatsächlich von einem kleinen Stuttgarter Label stammt. Sie sahen mich erwartungsvoll an.

Ich hatte eigentlich keinen Nerv, mich zu unterhaltenSmalltalk, aber Ihr Lächeln löste etwas in mir aus.

Mir fiel auf: Außer Ihnen lächelte niemand in dem ganzen Waggon. An den Gesichtern der Menschen konnte ich erkennen: Alle waren fertig von der Arbeit, der Uni, der Schule.

Ich dachte: Wieder eines dieser kurzen Gespräche, die man aus Höflichkeit führen muss

Alle wollten nur nach Hause. Die Stimmung war wie ein grauer Schleier, der sich über den ganzen Waggon gelegt hatte.

Nicht einmal die Kassiererin bei dm hatte zurückgelächelt, als ich ihr ein paar Minuten zuvor am Bahnhof Payback-Karte gereicht hatte.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich habe eine Woche lang jeden Tag einen Fremden angesprochen - das ist mir passiert

Sie begannen also, über meine Tasche zu reden und ich dachte: Na toll, wieder eines dieser kurzen Gespräche, die man aus Höflichkeit führen muss. Aber dann geschah etwas, das ich nicht erwartet hatte.

Die Smalltalk-Barriere war innerhalb kürzester Zeit wie weggeblasen. Wir unterhielten uns über unsere Familien, das Reisen und die Freiheiten meiner Generation. Zum ersten Mal seit Langem saß jemand neben mir, der wirklich zuhörte.

Zuhören, nicht um zu antworten

Nicht, um zu antworten. Nicht, um eine besondere Information herauszupicken, die er auf sich beziehen konnte, wie ""Oh, du hast also gerade eine Trennung hinter dir? Also bei mir war es damals wirklich schwer, ich habe nächtelang geweint.""

Sie waren jemand, der zuhört, um zu verstehen. Jemand, der nachhakt, mitfühlt. Und das nicht, weil er auf irgendetwas hinaus ist.

Irgendwann fiel das Thema auf einen guten Freund von mir, der vor ein paar Wochen in einem Motorradunfall verunglückt ist.

Von Ihnen kam kein: ""Ja, ich hatte da auch mal einen Freund, der einen Motorradunfall hatte. Ganz schlimm war das für mich."" Sie sagten einfach: ""Das muss richtig weh getan haben, oder? Wie war das, als Sie es erfahren haben?""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Schluss mit der Oberflächlichkeit!

Ich muss Sie komplett entgeistert angesehen haben. So offen und unverstellt hatte mich das noch nie jemand gefragt. Nicht einmal meine engsten Freunde. Sie haben mich in dem Moment zu Tränen gerührt. Auch Sie teilten etwas von sich mit mir.

Dabei kannte ich nicht einmal Ihren Namen

Sie erzählten mir, wie Sie die Liebe ihres Lebens verloren und wie gerne Sie Oma geworden wären. Es fühlte sich an als würden wir uns seit Jahren kennen. Dabei kannte ich nicht einmal Ihren Namen.

Wir fuhren etwa eine Stunde gemeinsam im Zug und redeten ohne Pause. Dann kamen wir in Ebersberg an. Ihre Station. Sie erhoben sich und richteten Ihren Mantel. Ich wollte nicht, dass Sie gehen.

Ich hatte Ihnen doch gerade so ziemlich mein ganzes Leben anvertraut. Sie bedankten sich für das Gespräch und mit einem letzten Lächeln schwanden sie durch die automatische Tür.

Da saß ich, wieder allein mit all den müden und kaputten Gesichtern. Wehmut überkam mich.

Liebe fremde Frau im Zug: Ich weiß weder Ihren Namen, noch wo Sie im Moment sind. Aber ich möchte mich bei Ihnen bedanken - dafür, dass Sie mir gezeigt haben: Es gibt noch Menschen, die wirklich zuhören. Nicht, um zu antworten, sondern um zu verstehen.

Ich war Ihnen in dieser Stunde im Zug näher als ich es den meisten meiner Freunde jemals gewesen bin.

La hoguera del independentismo catalán tiene el potencial de abrasar el gobierno belga, del que forman parte los liberales francófonos del primer ministro y los nacionalistas flamencos del NV-A.
Su jefe, Michel, dijo después que el tema no estaba en la agenda y que no ""echara más leña al fuego"".","La vida del corresponsal en Bruselas puede comenzar leyendo el Financial Times y terminar delante de la embajada venezolana, haciendo un rato guardia por si el expresident Puigdemont, el hombre más buscado de la capital europea, pudiera haber decidido pedir asilo bolivariano, al estilo de Julian Assange, instigador infatigable en las redes sociales del independentismo desde la embajada de Ecuador en Londres. No parece ser el caso.

Puigdemont no aparece por ningún lado, se mantiene en una clandestinidad cinematográfica que resulta muy difícil de explicar en esta era en la que el móvil es un apéndice del cuerpo de los humanos. Sin imágenes todavía de por medio, sabemos que Puigdemont se ha reunido con un abogado especializado en asilo y conocido por su defensa de miembros de ETA. Poco más.

Día de rumores. Rumores y más rumores envueltos de misterio por encima de nuestras posibilidades, incluso en la era de Twitter. Con cara de sorpresa y aires misteriosos, Bram Bombeek, portavoz de los nacionalistas flamencos, el partido N-VA, acude a la puerta de su sede para añadir confusión. Afirma con cara de póker. ""Ni desmiento ni confirmo que Puigdemont se vaya a reunir aquí. Lo único que puedo decir es que no se encuentra dentro de este edificio. ¿Quiere venir a comprobarlo?"".

Las informaciones confusas apuntaron después al parlamento flamenco, también en Bruselas. Por el celo con el que los servicios de seguridad chequean a la prensa al entrar en el Parlamento, Puigdemont podría estar dentro con el mismo Trump. Pero nada. Dentro del edificio no se percibe actividad alguna. De nuevo, un portavoz juega al despiste: ni confirma ni desmiente nada.

Las expectación por encontrar a Puigdemont ha ido in crescendo a lo largo del día. Al inicio sólo los periodistas belgas y españoles seguían su pista. Se suman ahora colegas de todo el mundo en un goteo constante. De Portugal, Francia, Reino Unido... La acera de la calle del partido NV-A se ha vuelto a llenar de nuevo. Comienzan a pasar las horas y no hay noticias. Solo rumores y bromas.

""¿Aparecerá al modo Hollande de paquete en una scooter conducida por Raul Romeva, su exconceller de exteriores?""; ""¡habrá que peinar el Bois de la Cambre! [el extenso bosque pulmón de la capital belga]""; ""¿Nos convocarán en modo guerrillero a una rueda de prensa en la selva?"".

De nuevo los rumores han generado una avalancha de periodistas hasta la sede de un partido político, la Alianza Europea de la Libertad (EFA en sus siglas en inglés), una formación que acoge a partidos nacionalistas europeos. El misterio aumenta al comprobar que en el mismo edificio se encuentra la sede del Centrum Maurits Coppieters, una organización que concedió un premio a Forcadell en septiembre pasado por su lucha por del derecho de autodeterminación. Un hombre que se marcha en bici asegura haber visto al catalán más conocido de Bélgica; en realidad, preguntado por los detalles, ha reconocido que han sido otros los que sí le han visto....

Pasan las horas y Puigdemoint sigue sin aparecer, pero la bola de nieve de su misterio alcanza ya al corazón de la política belga. El socialista Elio Di Rupo pide explicaciones al primer ministro Charles Michel por la ""probable visita de la delegación de Puigdemont"" a Bruselas. La hoguera del independentismo catalán tiene el potencial de abrasar el gobierno belga, del que forman parte los liberales francófonos del primer ministro y los nacionalistas flamencos del NV-A.

Hace menos de 24 horas el secretario de Estado de Migración y Asilo, Theo Francken, no ha descartado dar asilo a Puigdemont. Su jefe, Michel, dijo después que el tema no estaba en la agenda y que no ""echara más leña al fuego"". Conviene recordar que estamos en un país de delicados equilibrios políticos que pasó 561 días sin gobierno entre 2010 y 2011.

Seguimos sin rastro ni fotos o videos del hombre más buscado, pero las informaciones apuntan hacia una reunión entre el expresident y un abogado belga conocido por haber defendido a miembros de ETA para lograr asilo. Paul Beckaert ha recoconido a La Vanguardia haberse reunido con Puigdemont, aunque no da detalles del lugar ni de si su cliente estaba acompañado.

No se sabe dónde duerme Puigdemont. Supuestamente dará mañana una rueda de prensa, aunque nadie sabe el lugar. Bélgica, país que vio nacer a René Magritte, el pintor surrealista más genial, podría ser el nuevo hogar ideal para Puigdemont y su empeño de convertir lo impensable en realidad.

¿La destitución de Nieto Castillo responde a los intereses del partido que busca repetir en la presidencia sin importar que se lesione, aún más, su propia credibilidad y la legitimidad del sistema electoral en su conjunto?","Santiago Nieto Castillo, extitular de la FEPADE.

Dos eventos relevantes, separados por escasos 3 días, llaman a suspicacia dado que ambos ocurren en el contexto de un proceso electoral que ya se vislumbra como una lucha abierta y sin cuartel para ocupar la presidencia de la República en 2018.

Primero, la renuncia de Raúl Cervantes, ahora extitular de la Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) y el arribo en su lugar del subprocurador Jurídico y de Asuntos Internacionales, Alberto Elías Beltrán, como encargado del despacho, el lunes 16 de octubre. Segundo, el cese de Santiago Nieto Castillo, el viernes 20 del mismo mes, hasta entonces titular de la Fiscalía Especializada para la Atención de Delitos Electorales (FEPADE).

Primera suspicacia: menos de una semana en el cargo le bastó a Elías Beltrán para conocer las faltas cometidas por Nieto al, supuestamente, revelar detalles de una indagatoria iniciada por la FEPADE en contra del ex director de Petróleos Mexicanos, Emilio Lozoya Austin —quien se ha visto involucrado en el tema de los sobornos entregados por la empresa Odebrecht a funcionarios mexicanos en el contexto de la campaña presidencial de 2012 — y determinar la necesidad de separarlo de su puesto. ¿Qué prisa tuvo Elías Beltrán para, a escasos 3 días de haber tomado posesión de su encargo, destituir al titular de la FEPADE?

Segunda suspicacia: en escasos 4 días Elías Beltrán tomó posesión de su cargo, conoció de las faltas del ex fiscal, analizó el caso, maduró una decisión y la llevó a cabo. ¿Es acaso que la destitución de Santiago Nieto se cocinó antes de la renuncia del ahora ex procurador Raúl Cervantes, quien no ejecutó la decisión para no cargar con el costo político de semejante decisión?

¿Qué prisa tuvo Elías Beltrán para, a escasos 3 días de haber tomado posesión de su encargo, destituir al titular de la FEPADE?

Tercera suspicacia: si el mismo Santiago Nieto, en entrevista con Carlos Loret de Mola en el programa Despierta con Loret del 25 de octubre, negó haber violado el código de conducta de la Procuraduría General de la República ni normatividad alguna haciendo pública información de un caso, ni haber revelado el sigilo de ninguna carpeta de investigación —menos aún en torno a una investigación cuya carpeta estaba en proceso de integración por parte de la FEPADE—, ¿por qué el procurador interino no le concedió el privilegio de la duda y se tomó el tiempo necesario para corroborar los dichos del fiscal Nieto y se decidió mejor por una destitución fast track?

Cuarta suspicacia: en la misma entrevista con Loret de Mola, a pregunta expresa del periodista sobre si fue o no presionado por Emilio Lozoya, Nieto respondió que ""No hay presión si no te dejas presionar"" — frase, afirmó, del magistrado Leonel Castillo— reconociendo de manera indirecta que sí fue presionado, pero que ni esa ni otras presiones tienen efecto sobre su trabajo.

Siendo así, ¿por qué Elías Beltrán prefirió destituirlo por una supuesta violación al código de conducta de la PGR y no apoyarlo en la investigación que la FEPADE realiza en torno a la supuesta corrupción electoral del 2012? ¿Por qué el actual procurador dio más importancia a la actuación del funcionario de la fiscalía y no al enorme caso de corrupción electoral que involucra directamente al grupo en el poder y que él investigaba?

Quinta suspicacia: Everardo Moreno, abogado constitucionalista, sostuvo en la emisión de El Weso, que la discusión que se está llevando a cabo en el Senado de la República sobre la remoción de Nieto no tiene sentido, toda vez que la destitución del funcionario de la FEPADE es improcedente pues Elías Beltrán no reúne los requisitos para estar en el encargo que ocupa.

De acuerdo con el Artículo 102 constitucional, quien acceda al puesto de procurador deberá tener, por lo menos, 10 años de ejercicio profesional y la cédula del funcionario citado fue expedida en 2011. En consecuencia y a decir de Moreno, no debería haber tomado posesión en esas condiciones, además de que también contraviene el Artículo 30 de la Ley Orgánica de la PGR, que determina que el subprocurador Jurídico y de Asuntos Internacionales deberá sustituir al procurador general en caso de ""ausencias temporales"", no definitivas, como ocurrió con Cervantes.

Entonces Elías Beltrán estaría ocupando de manera ilegal e ilegítima el cargo de procurador, por lo que los actos por él realizados son nulos, lo que supondría que la destitución de Nieto también es nula pues quien lo decidió no tiene facultades para hacerlo, concluye Moreno.

Lo anterior lleva necesariamente a preguntarse, ¿los senadores ignoran el Artículo 102 constitucional, mismo que permite a Nieto seguir en su encargo sin necesidad de votaciones o discusiones especiales para restituirlo? o ¿han construido un enfrentamiento ficticio haciendo tiempo para que al cabo de diez días no sea posible rehabilitar a Nieto en su puesto, lo cual permitiría nombrar un fiscal a modo?

Sexta suspicacia: la velocidad con qué actuó Elías Beltrán para destituir a Nieto y el caso armado en contra del titular de la FEPADE, por una supuesta indiscreción y por haber denunciado ""falsas"" presiones en su contra para dejar fuera del caso de Odebrecht a Emilio Lozoya ¿son realmente posturas éticas que buscan moralizar la vida pública o responden a intereses políticos con miras al 2018?

Séptima suspicacia: ahora el ahora ex fiscal de la FEPADE, Santiago Nieto Castillo, ha retirado, por escrito, su objeción en torno a su destitución como titular de la FEPADE, argumentando su rechazo a la polarización de la sociedad y el daño a las instituciones. Argumento por demás ético y con visión de Estado que, sin embargo, lleva a preguntarse: ¿Por qué Nieto desiste antes de que el Senado vote para ratificar o rechazar su destitución? ¿Por qué la premura cuando partidos como el PAN, el PRD y MORENA estaban dando la batalla para restituirlo en sus funciones? ¿De qué altura vinieron las presiones que lo llevaron a tomar tal decisión? ¿Le ofrecieron algo más?

Últimas suspicacias: ¿A quién protege Elías Beltrán? ¿Busca cubrir la espalda de la administración saliente además de enterrar el escandaloso caso de corrupción de Odebrecht y el involucramiento de políticos mexicanos? ¿La destitución de Nieto Castillo responde a los intereses del partido que busca repetir en la presidencia sin importar que se lesione, aún más, su propia credibilidad y la legitimidad del sistema electoral en su conjunto? ¿El desistimiento de Santiago Nieto responde a presiones que no puede manejar?

Mehr über den Ausgleichsfonds und seine Erträge erfahrt ihr in unserem Video

Der bayerische Staat hat wegen Sondergenehmigungen kaum Kontrolle über die Erträge des Ausgleichsfonds

Deutschland hat wie jede moderne Demokratie ein wichtiges Grundrecht: Die Gleichheit vor dem Gesetz. Dieses Recht sollte für alle gelten.

Doch für manche scheint es Ausnahmen zu geben. Zum Beispiel für einige Mitglieder des sogenannten deutschen Hochadels. Die Familie der Wittelsbacher kassiert bis heute jedes Jahr 14 Millionen Euro als Entschädigung dafür, dass das ehemalige bayerische Königshaus auf seine Herrschaftsansprüche verzichtet hat. Plus: Die Gelder sind steuerfrei und unterliegen keinen Kontrollen.

Lange war der Öffentlichkeit nicht bekannt, wie lukrativ der Deal für die Adelsfamilie ist

Nach jahrelangem Streit traf der Freistaat 1923 während der Weimarer Republik eine Vereinbarung mit der abgesetzten Königsfamilie und legte den Wittelsbacher Ausgleichfonds (WAF) auf. Mehr dazu erfahrt ihr auch in unserem Video. Darin befinden sich Gelder, Unternehmensanteile, Ländereien, Schlösser und Kunstschätze. Mit dem WAF, einer Stiftung des öffentlichen Rechts, soll das kulturelle Erbe des Hauses Wittelsbach bewahrt und vor allem die Erben der bayerischen Könige alimentiert werden.

Auch Sonderprivilegien wie Wohnrechte im Würzburger Residenzschloss, auf Herrenchiemsee und in Nymphenburg sowie Ticketprovisionen für den Eintritt in verschiedene Schlösser gehören dazu. Lange war der Öffentlichkeit nicht bekannt, wie lukrativ der Deal für die Adelsfamilie ist.

Wie fürstlich die sogenannten Entschädigungen ausfallen, ergab eine Anfrage von Katharina Schulze, Abgeordnete der Grünen im bayerischen Landtag im vergangenen Jahr: Die Bilanzsumme betrug nach Auskunft des Finanzministeriums zuletzt 348 Millionen Euro. Durchschnittlich erhält die Familie aus dem Fonds etwa 14 Millionen pro Jahr, steuerfrei.

""Da lebt das adelige Leben fort, obwohl der Adel abgeschafft ist“, sagte Schulze dem ""Münchner Merkur“. ""Eine Begründung dafür kann es in einem demokratischen Staat eigentlich nicht mehr geben.“

Der Rechnungshof will den Ausgleichsfonds nicht prüfen - zumindest nicht bald

Auf Anfrage der HuffPost erklärt Schulze: ""Dies ist möglich wegen einer Sondergenehmigung: Vom Bayerischen Obersten Rechnungshof (ORH) wird der Fonds – im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen öffentlich-rechtlichen Stiftungen – nicht geprüft.“

Die Grünen beantragten daraufhin mehr Transparenz. Thomas Mütze, finanzpolitischer Sprecher, fordert eine Gleichbehandlung mit anderen öffentlich-rechtlichen Stiftungen – also eine Kontrolle des WAF. Die CSU lehnte den Antrag ab. ""Laut CSU sei er überflüssig, da der ORH die Vereinbarung jederzeit widerrufen könne“, berichtet Schulze.

Doch auf einen Widerruf der Sondergenehmigung scheint der Rechnungshof keine rechte Lust zu haben:“ Es gibt keine Anzeichen dafür, dass sich etwas ändert“, sagte der Grünen-Abgeordnete Thomas Mütze im Gespräch mit der HuffPost. Ein Sprecher des Rechnungshofes sagte dazu der ""Süddeutschen“ nur: ""Wann der ORH prüft, entscheidet er selber.“

""Dabei ging es uns bei dem Antrag nicht einmal um die Rechtmäßigkeit des Geldes, sondern nur um Transparenz“, sagte Mütze. Doch von Transparenz und Kontrolle durch den Staat scheint sich der Wittelsbacher Ausgleichfonds immer weiter zu entfernen.

""Das Finanzministerium will sich nicht mit dem ehemaligen Königshaus anlegen“

Das bayerische Finanzministerium versuchte nämlich in den vergangenen Jahren, mehr Kontrolle auf den WAF auszuüben – jedoch ohne Erfolg. Zuletzt trug es mit dem WAF einen Rechtsstreit aus, in dem es darum ging, wie viel Geld der Fonds ausschütten darf und wie weit die Kontrollrechte des Freistaats reichen. Doch als das Ministerium in der ersten Instanz unterlag, gab es auf.

""Seitdem passiert nichts mehr“, sagte Mütze. ""Das Finanzministerium will sich nicht mit dem ehemaligen Königshaus anlegen.“

Der Abgeordnete weist auch auf ein weiteres Sonderrecht innerhalb des WAF hin: ""Das Geld bekommen vor allem die männlichen Erben“, sagte er. Tatsächlich werden die weiblichen Mitglieder der Wittelsbacher stark benachteiligt. Die Erträge gehen zunächst an das männliche Oberhaupt der jeweiligen Linien der Adelsfamilie. Den Löwenanteil erhält der Urenkel des letzten bayerischen Königs und Chef der Wittelsbacher, Franz Herzog von Bayern.

Frauen erhalten dagegen nur ""bis zu ihrer Vermählung“ Geld aus dem Fonds. Gegen die Regelung klagten vor Jahrzehnten drei Prinzessinnen der Familie und beriefen sich dabei ironischerweise auf den Gleichheitsgrundsatz im Grundgesetz. Doch ihre Klage war nicht von Erfolg gekrönt.

Denn der WAF beruht auf Ungleichheit: Auch wenn heute laut Grundgesetz Gleichheit gilt - hier herrscht eine Regelung aus einer Zeit, in der Königsadel gegenüber Normalsterblichen, Männer gegenüber Frauen bevorzugt wurden.

Doch was war in einer Monarchie Privateigentum und was Eigentum des Staates?

Und was sagen die Wittelsbacher dazu? Das 84-jährige Oberhaupt Franz Herzog von Bayern residiert im Nymphenburger Schloss und wird als höflicher und freundlicher Herr beschrieben, der sich um die Belange der Familie kümmert und leidenschaftlicher Kunstsammler ist. Zu dem Antrag der Grünen sagte er der ""taz"": ""In jedem Fall ist es gut, wenn es eine gewisse Transparenz gibt. Wir haben da keine Geheimnisse.“

Weiter sagte er über den WAF und die Sonderprivilegien: ""Ich habe auch durchaus Verständnis, wenn das der eine oder andere unzeitgemäß findet. Aber ein Privileg klingt für mich wie etwas, was einem aus Gunst verliehen wurde. In unserem Fall waren es aber rein privatrechtliche Ansprüche.“

Doch was war in einer Monarchie Privateigentum und was Eigentum des Staates?

Eine Frage übrigens, die nicht nur Bayern betrifft: In Baden Würtemberg gibt es Streit mit dem ehemals regierenden Haus Baden. Es erhebt Ansprüche auf Kunstschätze, die in den baden-württembergischen Museen ausgestellt sind – der Rechtsstatus sei mindestens unklar, berichtet die ""Welt"".

Adel verpflichtet, sagt man so schön. Tatsächlich vernichtet er wohl eher – und zwar jede Vorstellung von Gleichheit in der Gesellschaft.

Après l'ancien directeur de campagne de Donald Trump, Paul Manafort, deux autres hommes de l'entourage du président américain sont visés par des accusations dans le cadre de l'enquête sur une ingérence de la Russie dans la campagne présidentielle américaine de 2016.

Un ex-membre de l'équipe de campagne de Donald Trump, George Papadopoulos, a été mis en accusation et a plaidé coupable d'avoir menti aux enquêteurs du FBI, a annoncé lundi 30 octobre le procureur spécial chargé de l'enquête russe à Washington.

George Papadopoulos, qui était chargé des questions de politique étrangère, a par ses fausses déclarations ""entravé l'enquête en cours du FBI sur l'existence de liens ou de coordination éventuels entre des personnes associées à la campagne et le gouvernement russe pour interférer dans l'élection présidentielle de 2016"", souligne l'acte signé par le procureur Robert Mueller.

12 chefs d'inculpation

Le troisième accusé est Richard (""Rick"") Gates, l'un des associés de Paul Manafort. Selon le New York Times, le nom de Rick Gates apparaît sur des documents de sociétés domiciliées à Chypre et par lesquelles Paul Manafort aurait reçu des paiements en provenance d'Europe de l'Est.

Manafort et Gates se voient principalement reprocher des activités non déclarées de lobbyiste et consultant en faveur de l'ancien président ukrainien pro-russe, Viktor Ianoukovitch. Plus de 75 millions de dollars ont transité par des comptes offshore gérés par les deux hommes, Paul Manafort étant accusé d'avoir blanchi à lui seul 18 millions de dollars. Ces opérations lui ont permis de ""mener grand train"" aux États-Unis, acquérant notamment diverses propriétés luxueuses, souligne l'acte d'accusation.

Sommé de se rendre à la justice, Paul Manafort, est arrivé lundi matin au FBI pour répondre de 12 chefs d'inculpation. Comme Richard Gates, il est poursuivi pour complot contre les États-Unis, blanchiment, fausses déclarations et non déclarations de comptes détenus à l'étranger. Tous deux ont plaidé non coupables.

Paul Manafort avait rejoint l'équipe de campagne du milliardaire républicain en mars 2016, avant d'être contraint de démissionner quelques mois après. Il a été assigné à résidence par une juge lundi soir.

""Désolé, mais c'était il y a des années""

Ces annonces offrent un vif contraste avec le secret et la discrétion qui entourent depuis six mois la tentaculaire enquête menée par Robert Mueller, un ancien patron de la police fédérale américaine qui a été nommé en mai pour diriger ces investigations sur l'ingérence russe dans l'élection présidentielle. Contrairement à un simple procureur fédéral, Robert Mueller dispose d'une plus grande latitude d'action et d'une indépendance renforcée.

Réagissant sur Twitter, Donald Trump a affirmé que les faits reprochés à Paul Manafort remontaient à ""des années"". ""Il n'y a AUCUNE COLLUSION!"", a-t-il écrit. ""Pourquoi Hillary la crapule et les démocrates ne sont-ils pas visés?????"", a ajouté le président américain.

Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus????? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 30 octobre 2017

....Also, there is NO COLLUSION! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 30 octobre 2017

Il a malgré tout assuré, par la voix de la porte-parole de la Maison Blanche Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, qu'il n'avait ""aucune intention"" de remettre en cause le procureur spécial Robert Mueller.

Pour Donald Trump, qui ne cesse de dénoncer l'enquête confiée à Robert Mueller comme une ""chasse aux sorcières"" reposant sur du néant, ces inculpations sont un coup, car elles viennent confirmer la réalité d'infractions criminelles présumées. Mais, en même temps, le président américain peut pour l'heure constater avec soulagement que le soupçon le plus grave, celui d'être arrivé à la Maison Blanche grâce à une entente avec un pouvoir étranger, n'est pas étayé.

Darum geht es bei den ""Königschroniken""

Rother entwirft darin eine mittelalterliche Welt, die germanische und nordische Mythen, staufisches Kaisertum und orientalische Kulturen mit fantastischen Elementen kombiniert. Das Schicksal der Welt liegt in den Händen dreier Frauen: der Sklavin Ildris, die geheimnisvolle Kräfte besitzt, der jungen, ehrgeizigen Leyken aus dem Oasenvolk des Südens und Sölva, der unehelichen Tochter des Stammesfürsten Morwa. Können sie gegen die Dunkelheit bestehen? Kann eine von ihnen das Land aus der Dunkelheit führen?

Doch wie viel Wahrheit steckt in den Chroniken? Was ist dran an den Mythen, die uns heute noch erschauern lassen? Wie gruselig war das Mittelalter wirklich? Die Antworten darauf liefert der Fantasy-Autor der Nachrichtenagentur spot on news.

Stephan Rother über die Ursprünge von Halloween

Rother: Samhain, der Ursprung des Halloweenfestes, markierte bei den Kelten den Beginn des Winters. Die Natur stirbt dahin, der Gedanke an menschliche Vergänglichkeit liegt nahe, und die Schleier des Nebels können Sie in diesen Tagen beinahe mit Händen greifen. Die Toten sind unterwegs; mit dem Allerheiligenfest konnte die christliche Kirche die Auswahl auf die freundlicheren Toten beschränken. Allerdings hat das Mittelalter auch insgesamt einen eher praktischen Umgang mit dem Tod. Wenn sie an einer Krankheit leiden, fesseln sie diese Krankheit nach den Anweisungen eines Rituals an einen Riemen aus Hirschleder, den sie anschließend einem Toten mit ins Grab geben. Dem Toten kann die Krankheit nicht mehr schaden, und sie sind ihr Gebrechen los.

In ""Ein Reif von Eisen"" wimmelt es von solchen Ritualen, von Hexen und von finsterer Magie. Haben die Menschen des Mittelalters tatsächlich an so etwas geglaubt?

Rother: Sie haben daran geglaubt, wie ein Kranker an die Wirksamkeit seiner Medizin glaubt, selbst wenn es sich in Wahrheit um einen Placebo handelt. Obwohl das Präparat gar keine Wirkstoffe enthält, wird schon dieser Glaube eine positive Wirkung haben. Wenn Sie selbst und alle Menschen um Sie herum davon überzeugt sind, dass im Sumpf der Geist eines Gehenkten umgeht, werden Sie in nebligen Nächten womöglich die erstaunlichsten Dinge zu sehen bekommen.

Für die Figuren in ""Ein Reif von Eisen"" scheinen solche gruseligen Erscheinungen fast zum Alltag zu gehören.

Rother: Heute haben wir den Bewegungsmelder, der unsichtbar den Gartenzaun bewacht. Das Mittelalter kennt ein ähnliches System: Die Hage-Zussa, die geisterhafte Hecken-Sitzerin, aus der sich unser Wort 'Hexe' entwickelt hat. Oder nehmen Sie eine freundlich-sprudelnde Quelle: Für das Mittelalter ist sie zugleich ein unheimlicher Ort. Wo das Wasser aus der Welt des Unsichtbaren in die Welt des Sichtbaren tritt, muss das auch umgekehrt möglich sein. Quellen gelten als Einstieg in das Totenreich der Göttin Hel, die 'Hölle'. Als 'Frau Holle' hat die düstere Göttin bis heute überlebt. Unsere Wohnungstür sichern wir mit einem Türalarm. Im Mittelalter wird ein Bauopfer unter der Türschwelle beigesetzt, an dem die Unholde sich gütlich tun können, so dass sie keinen Grund mehr haben, die Wohnung zu betreten.

In einer besonders blutigen Szene in ""Ein Reif von Eisen"" kauert der junge Dieb Pol unter dem Schafott. Auffällig ist, dass die Henker offenbar eine Fülle von Regeln zu beachten haben.

Rother: Da war das Mittelalter penibel. Zur Enthauptung kniet der Verurteilte aufrecht vor dem Henker, der ihm aus der Körperdrehung heraus mit dem Richtschwert den Kopf abschlägt. Ein Bewegungsablauf, der Golfspielern vertraut sein dürfte. Wobei Henker vor Missgeschicken keineswegs gefeit sind: Geht der erste Schlag in Nacken oder Hinterkopf, wird meist um Nachschlag gebeten. Das ist tatsächlich der Fachbegriff. Besondere Stümper unter den Henkern mussten bis zu einem Dutzend Mal zuschlagen und konnten dann froh sein, wenn sie von der Menge nicht ihrerseits gelyncht wurden. Andererseits wird von wahren Meistern ihrer Kunst berichtet, denen es gelang, zwei Verurteilte mit ein und demselben Schlag zu enthaupten oder aber mitsamt dem Opfer auch noch einen Blumenstrauß zu köpfen, den dieses in der Hand hielt.

Enthauptungen gehörten also zu den grausamsten Strafen?

Rother: Ganz im Gegenteil. Beim Vierteilen wird das Opfer von Pferden auseinandergerissen, die an seine Arme und Beine gebunden werden. Meist ist der Körper des Verurteilten zu diesem Zeitpunkt aber bereits ausgeweidet worden. Chroniken der Kreuzfahrerzeit wiederum berichten davon, dass lediglich der Anfang der Gedärme an einen Pfahl gebunden wurde, woraufhin man die Opfer solange unter Peitschenhieben im Kreis trieb, bis sie tot zusammenbrachen. Und wo die eigene Fantasie versagt, holt man sich Anregungen. Im Epos von Tristan und Isolde soll die Königin wegen ehelicher Untreue auf dem Scheiterhaufen verbrannt werden. Da macht eine Gruppe von hundert grässlich entstellten Aussätzigen den Vorschlag, man möge sie doch lieber ihnen übergeben. Die Krankheit steigere ihre Begierde. Was Isolde da erwarte, sei schrecklicher als jede Todesstrafe.

Sie selbst, Stephan M. Rother, sind ein Mensch unserer eigenen Zeit. Warum sind Sie selbst so fasziniert von dieser unheimlichen Zeit, dass Sie diese Geschichte geschrieben haben, ""Ein Reif von Eisen"", mit all ihren unheimlichen Details?

Rother: Ich halte mich selbst nicht für besonders abergläubisch. Doch gilt nicht der Skorpion als unheimlichstes unter den Tierkreiszeichen? Nicht ohne Grund fällt auch Halloween in das Zeichen des Skorpions, und ich selbst bin als Skorpion wenige Tage vor Halloween zur Welt gekommen. Mein Großvater war übrigens ein sehr gefragter Wünschelrutengänger und hätte mit Sicherheit eine Menge über die Welt des Unsichtbaren zu erzählen gewusst. Leider habe ich nichts von seiner Gabe geerbt - doch vielleicht habe ich ja meinen eigenen Weg gefunden?",Stephan M. Rother: So gruselig war das Mittelalter wirklich,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/30/stephan-m-rother-so-gruselig-war-das-mittelalter-wirklich_n_18419834.html?utm_hp_ref=germany&amp;ir=Germany

This meant even the slightest hint of a problem would cause pain signals in the brain.","Amid all the health crises facing Canadians, one particular disease tends to be left out of the normal conversation. It's known as irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, and as the name implies, the symptoms are rather troublesome for anyone who suffers. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians are left with a variety of symptoms ranging from bloating to diarrhea. But the one common trait to this disease is abdominal pain, which can in some cases be overwhelming.

Figuring out why IBS causes pain has been a major focus of research for over four decades. At first, the most common denominator was stress. As the years went on, other options came to light such as genetics and the nature of the gut microbiota. Yet, these options did not take into consideration one aspect of pain — namely, how the signals end up in the brain.

Then, in 2008, an answer was at hand. A group of British researchers identified a massive increase in a particular molecule on the surface of rectal cells capable of transmitting pain to the brain. That molecule was transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1, but most neuroscientists refer to it simply as TRPV1.

This discovery may be considered somewhat odd because TRPV1, as one might infer from the name, is usually thought to be on the tongue. It's partly responsible for identifying the taste of salt. But it's best known as the molecule that causes your tongue to burn like fire when you have a chili pepper. When the active ingredient in any hot pepper — capsaicin — meets up with TRPV1, you instantly feel pain in the brain. The same occurs with the hot ingredient in black pepper, piperine, although to a much lesser extent.

At the time, the identification of TRPV1 in the rectum suggested that, much like the tongue, the bowels could be sensitive to a variety of different ""taste molecules."" But determining which suspects were to blame would be almost impossible, considering the diversity of possible chemicals in the bowels.

There was a surprise in store that changed the way they viewed IBS.

A group of European researchers had a different approach. Instead of looking at individual molecules from food and bacteria, they chose to look at human factors involved in forcing TRPV1 to send signals of pain to the brain. They used a 20-year-old description of IBS as their guide. Back then, the disease was considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction, essentially an allergy. The team hoped they could find the same molecule involved in allergies — histamine — as the reason for the pain.

When they tested this theory in humans they were pleased to find the link existed. Adding histamine before adding capsaicin led to more pain. But there was a surprise in store that changed the way they viewed IBS.

The researchers found they could change the way TRPV1 sent signals to the brain. If they left the molecule in the presence of histamine for a long period of time, the molecule would be more sensitive to capsaicin. This phenomenon, known as sensitization, was fascinating and suggested those with IBS may be more sensitized to pain.

As to how that might have happened, the team figured they knew the answer. Many people suffering with IBS note they endured a gastrointestinal infection sometime before the symptoms started. Pathogens such as norovirus, salmonella, and especially campylobacter jejuni all seemed to be at fault. If the team was on the right track, people who had suffered from one of these infections may have sensitized their TRPV1 leading to the pain.

Last week, the team revealed they were correct. As expected, they found highly sensitized TRPV1 molecules in those people with IBS following a gastrointestinal infection. However, there was a rather unwelcome realization accompanying this discovery.

The team began with the theory there was some type of long-term hypersensitivity occurring in the gut. Yet, when they looked for an increase in immune molecules — including histamine — involved in allergies, they were disappointeded. There was no allergy. A normal level of histamine in the gut was all it took to cause pain.

This meant even the slightest hint of a problem would cause pain signals in the brain.

Taking a closer look at the TRPV1 molecule, the team realized it had been trained to become more sensitive to low levels of histamine. Somehow, during the infection, the micro-environment of the bowels and rectum had become more cautious of any chemical coming into the area. This meant even the slightest hint of a problem would cause pain signals in the brain.

Because of this reality, the team felt there may be a way to block the pain. They tested their theory using two anti-allergy medications known as pyrilamine and ebastine, which already had proven to be effective in IBS patients. As expected, these molecules blocked the response to histamine and turned off the pain trigger.

The results offer some indication of how pain gets sent from the bowel to the brain. Yet the information also offers a possible direction forward for treatment by targeting the immune system. Granted, it will be years before histamine blocking medications are tested for IBS treatments in humans. Even so, thanks to this research, those who suffer from IBS may breathe a little easier knowing a way to stop one of the routes to pain may be coming sooner rather than later.

Voici quelques réactions des différents gagnants recueillies pendant et après le 39e Gala de l'ADISQ, dimanche.

Patrice Michaud

Interprète masculin de l'année

Chanson de l'année – Kamikaze

(À propos du fait qu'il s'est déclaré fier de lui-même sur scène) «À un moment donné, il faut être fier de son travail. Si je n'avais pas gagné, j'aurais été fier quand même, mais de la manière que c'est souligné - et je sais qu'on n'est pas à côté de la cible -, je trouve que ça ne se dit pas assez souvent. Et c'est correct que ça soit moi qui le dise, parce que je ne pense pas être reconnu comme le dernier des vantards. Mais il faut les dire, ces affaires-là! Je n'avais rien préparé, je n'avais pas de papier, je l'ai dit sur scène, préparer des remerciements, j'haïs ça faire ça. C'est donc sorti seul, mais ce n'est pas moins vrai.»

«On travaille tout le temps fort ; dans le marché où on est, si tu ne travailles pas fort, tu vas en échapper des bouts. C'est beaucoup de travail, beaucoup d'investissement, des sacrifices, de la fatigue, de la nouvelle fatigue, on réalise qu'on peut être plus fatigué que fatigué... Mais en même temps, ce n'est pas du travail, c'est un plaisir et un privilège. Reste que, quand on se sent fier de son travail, c'est naturel de le dire.»

Safia Nolin

Interprète féminine de l'année

Album de l'année : Réinterprétations – Reprises Vol.1

«Je me sens full bien. C'est étrange. J'étais au maximum du choc! Je ne m'attendais «crissement» pas à ça. C'est probablement la plus grosse surprise de ma vie (...) Ce soir, quand je vais me coucher, je vais me dire que j'ai envie d'écouter les deux épisodes de Stranger Things qu'il me manque, je vais me dire que demain, je pars à Québec et que ma maison est un petit peu en bordel, et ça m'angoisse, mais aussi que tout ça était peut-être un rêve! C'est bizarre. L'année passée (elle avait été sacrée Révélation de l'année, NDLR), j'avais trouvé ça vraiment intense, mais là c'est juste... C'est comme le tome 2! On dirait que je ne veux pas réaliser que j'ai battu Céline (Dion)... J'étais tellement sûr que Céline allait gagner que je l'ai effacée de ma mémoire. Elle n'existait plus le temps du speach...»

Klô Pelgag

Auteur ou compositeur de l'année

Album de l'année : Alternatif - L'étoile thoracique

Album de l'année : Choix de la critique – L'étoile thoracique

(À propos du fait que la dernière femme à avoir remporté le prix d'Auteur ou compositeur de l'année était Francine Raymond, en 1993). «Je trouve ça incroyable que ça fasse aussi longtemps! En même temps, je suis hyper honorée que ça soit moi qui reprenne le flambeau. Je suis certaine que dans le futur, il va y en avoir beaucoup d'autres. C'est un honneur émouvant. Le prix d'auteur-compositeur, pour moi, veut aussi dire beaucoup, parce que ça reconnaît le travail d'écriture, les compositions, et c'est quelque chose que je trouve hyper, hyper important, et que je fais tous les jours de ma vie. C'est fou!»

Daniel Bélanger

Album de l'année : pop – Paloma

Spectacle de l'année : Auteur-compositeur-interprète – Paloma

«Avec les années, les trophées ont de plus en plus d'importance, parce que ça fait, voilà, 25 ans que je fais ça cette année, et d'être encore reconnu pour le travail qu'on fait, c'est pas comme le premier qu'on gagne! En fait c'est pas comme le sixième ; le premier, on est très, très heureux, mais 25 ans plus tard, ça prend une autre tournure, que je ne soupçonnais pas.»

Les Sœurs Boulay – Groupe ou duo de l'année

«Quand on a gagné ce prix-là pour la première fois il y a deux ans, on se sentait un peu comme des imposteurs, parce que ça ne faisait pas longtemps qu'on était dans ce milieu-là. On sentait peut-être qu'on ne le méritait pas, on avait peur de ne pas durer dans le temps. De le gagner deux ans après, ça vient, comme, sceller quelque chose. On prend une pause (d'un an, NDLR) parce que je vais accoucher bientôt, mais on va quand même revenir après. Je pense qu'on a l'intention d'être dans le paysage musical longtemps. Ça vient nous donner espoir que c'est possible de durer», a expliqué Mélanie Boulay.

«C'est vrai, on est vraiment sur la fin. C'est comme un au-revoir le fun, avant de quitter, de (prendre un petit break), de se faire dire : hé, les filles, vous êtes encore là, c'est cool ce que vous faites! C'est une belle tape dans le dos pour avoir envie de revenir, justement», a renchéri Stéphanie Boulay.

Alaclair Ensemble – Album de l'année : Hip Hop – Les frères cueilleurs

«On le prend comme n'importe qui le prendrait, c'est une bonne publicité. On était déconnectés depuis longtemps au niveau d'Alaclair, on n'était même pas signés sur une maison de disques. Cette année, c'est un enchaînement d'événements. On a signé avec Disques 7e Ciel, qui appartient à un ami à nous. On a voulu faire changement juste pour nous, nous renouveler, et avec toutes les carrières parallèles, on est là, à gagner un prix, ce qui, pour nous, signifie ce que ça signifie. Ça reste mainstream, on le prend, on l'apprécie, on remercie, mais on se souvient d'où vient toute cette motivation à la base», a dit Claude Bégin.

Émile Bilodeau - Révélation de l'année

«Ça me donne le goût d'en écrire encore plus, des «mautadites» tunes qui restent dans la tête! Saratoga, Samuele, NKLO, Alexe Gaudreault (qui étaient en nomination contre lui, NDLR), c'est des amis. Je suis très fier de faire partie de ces cinq-là. De voir que mon nom est sorti, j'étais très content. Michel-Olivier Gasse, de Saratoga, a fait la contrebasse sur mon album. C'est vraiment un travail d'équipe, la musique. J'étais content de pouvoir prendre le temps de saluer leur travail et de les féliciter.»

Ils ont aussi gagné...

Eine Unterwasserfotografin hat nun bedrückende Aufnahmen von großen Mengen Abfall in der karibischen See veröffentlicht

Die Aufnahmen, die uns eine Lehre sein sollten, seht ihr oben im Video

Es ist übel: Jedes Jahr landen rund neun Millionen Tonnen Kunststoffabfälle in den Ozeanen unserer Erde. Das geht aus einem Bericht der Umweltorganisation Oceancare hervor.

Der Plastikmüll zersetzt sich nicht, wie etwa zum Beispiel Lebensmittelabfälle. Das hat für Mensch und Tier drastische Folgen.

Treibendes Plastik wird für viele Meerestiere zur tödlichen Falle. Sie verfangen sich in den Kunststoffteilen und werden so zum Beispiel langsam erdrosselt. Größere Plastikteile zerfallen unter Einwirkung von Sonnenstrahlen und Salzwasser zu Mikropartikeln. Diese schadstoffreichen Mikropartikel werden von Meerestieren verschluckt. Über die marine Nahrungskette gelangen sie so sogar bis zu uns Menschen.

Viele Tiere verenden grausam

Einige Tiere verenden, weil sie größere Plastikteile verschlucken. So fallen laut Oceancare hunderttausende Delphine, Wale und Robben dem Plastikmüll zum Opfer. Die Zahl der toten Seevögel gehe laut der Organisation in die Millionen.

Das Ausmaß des Dramas zeigen nun auch Fotos, die in der Karibik entstanden sind. Die Fotografin Caroline Power war auf einem Tauch-Trip nahe der Insel Roatan in Honduras unterwegs. Doch anstatt der blauen See sah sie dort einen acht Kilometer langen Teppich von Plastikmüll, der auf der Meeresoberfläche schwamm.

Jeder kann seinen Beitrag dazu leisten, das Problem zu lösen

Die Unterwasserfotografin war von dem Anblick entsetzt und postete die Fotos auf Facebook. Dazu schrieb sie: “Es ist bestürzend, mit anzusehen, wie das Meer durch menschlichen Abfall langsam erstickt.“

Dem “Telegraph“ sagte sie: “Es macht mich unglaublich traurig, sehen zu müssen, wie so ein schöner Teil unseres Planeten so sinnlos zerstört wird.“

Plastik ist aus unserem Alltag zwar kaum mehr wegzudenken, der Plastikverbrauch lässt sich jedoch leicht reduzieren. Jeder kann einen Teil dazu beitragen, indem er zum Beispiel auf Plastiktüten oder Plastikbesteck verzichtet. Es liegt an uns Menschen dafür zu sorgen, dass diese Bilder bald der Vergangenheit angehören.

They could certainly be used to gain leverage over the former Trump associates, but there was no smoking gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia.

WASHINGTON ― There may have been a brief moment Monday morning when the White House thought the week wouldn't be so bad. The federal grand jury indictment unsealed against Donald Trump 's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort , and his longtime associate Rick Gates, dealt with much of their lobbying work before the 2016 election.

Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????

But any moment of optimism would have been short-lived. Not long after Manafort and Gates were in federal custody, special counsel Robert Mueller's team dropped another bombshell: They'd flipped a former Trump campaign adviser months ago.

The charges against Trump's former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos ― a little-known, little-qualified 30-year-old who listed his involvement in Model United Nations as one of his credentials ― may end up being a much bigger part of the Russia investigation. The Papadopoulos charges, dated Oct. 5 but only unsealed on Monday, deal directly with his work during the election and his attempt to link up the Russian government with the Trump campaign. His statements also make clear that he was acting with the involvement of higher-ranking officials in Trump's orbit.

The charges against Papadopoulos became public less than six months after Mueller, a former FBI director, was chosen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to head up the Russia probe. But Papadopoulos was first arrested on July 27, when he landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on a flight from Germany. And he's been cooperating ever since.

The public may only now be seeing the first fruits of Mueller's investigation, but Papadopoulos has been on the hook for a while.

Papadopoulos was charged with lying during an interview with the FBI back in January about his communications with Russians when he served as one of Trump's foreign policy advisers.

On March 24, 2016, just days after Papadopoulos was publicly identified as one of the Trump campaign's foreign policy advisers, he met with a professor in London who had ""substantial connections"" to Russian government officials, according to the charges against him.

In an interview with FBI agents this year, Papadopoulos claimed that the professor had told him the Russians had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton before he'd joined the campaign. But that wasn't true: Papadopoulos wasn't told about the ""dirt"" and ""thousands of emails"" that the Russians had on Clinton until more than a month after he joined the campaign.

Hillary Clinton holds an unscheduled news conference to talk about FBI inquiries into her emails after a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa, on Oct. 28, 2016.

Papadopoulos continued trying to arrange a meeting between the campaign and the Russian government, and he emailed a ""Senior Policy Advisor"" on the Trump campaign to tell them he had ""some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.""

In one email, a ""high-ranking campaign official"" forwarded Papadopoulos' email to another campaign official and noted the need to ""communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips"" and that they should send ""someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.""

Papadopoulos knew about hacked DNC emails

The timing of when Papadopoulos found out that Russia had ""thousands of emails"" on Clinton is particularly noteworthy. Papadopoulos found out the hacked emails existed in April 2016. The leaked emails hacked from Democratic National Committee staffers' accounts weren't made public until July 2016. And the emails hacked from John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, weren't released until October.

That means a Trump campaign official knew something was coming from the Russian government that would damage the Clinton campaign, months before the public did.

In his interview with the FBI, Papadopoulos allegedly tried to downplay his meetings with the professor with ties to Russia, calling him ""a nothing."" In reality, Papadopoulos knew of the professor's ""substantial connections to Russian government officials"" and used the professor's connection to try to connect the campaign with the Russian government.

The pending charges against Manafort are still significant because of the leverage they offer Mueller. Manafort, 68, could face a stiff federal prison sentence if convicted, which gives Mueller's team serious leverage to convince him to fully cooperate in the probe about the campaign's connections to Russia.

Paul Manafort listens during a discussion on security at Trump Tower in the Manhattan borough of New York on Aug. 17, 2016.

The White House circulated talking points Monday, asking its GOP allies to stress that Manafort is ""not a part of the administration."" Conservative media also downplayed the indictment, saying Manafort's problematic work was ""many years before he joined Trump"" and ""well before"" he joined the campaign.

Papadopoulos is also not part of the current administration, but the three indictments together make it tougher for Trump to completely distance himself from the controversy. In the past, the Trump team has tried to write off troubling individuals as peripheral to their operation.

While Papadopoulos was a low-level official, he was certainly a part of the campaign. He attended a meeting with Trump and Jeff Sessions, who later became attorney general, in March 2016. There's even a photo of them at a table together, with Papadopoulos sitting four places to Trump's right and two places to Sessions' left.",Robert Mueller Flipped A Trump Campaign Adviser.

Die Ausrede ist beschämend

Die AfD will offenbar privat Daten von Journalisten sammeln, beugt sich jetzt aber öffentlichem Druck.

Die neue rechtspopulistische Partei im Bundestag ist für ihren bisweilen feindseligen Umgang mit Journalisten bekannt, die Kritik an ihr üben. Was sie sich jetzt geleistet hat, stellt das Bisherige allerdings in den Schatten:

Wenn sich ein Reporter für den Bundesparteitag im Dezember in Hannover anmelden wollte, verlangte die AfD die Erlaubnis, selbst sensible Personendaten erheben, speichern und nutzen zu dürfen. Das berichtete unter anderem die ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"".

Erlaubnis betraf Daten zu politischer Meinung und Sexualleben

Konkret bezog sich die AfD auf Paragraf 3 Absatz 9 des Bundesdatenschutzgesetzes. Also auf ""Angaben über die rassische und ethnische Herkunft, politische Meinungen, religiöse oder philosophische Überzeugungen, Gewerkschaftszugehörigkeit, Gesundheit oder Sexualleben"".

Ohne die Zustimmung konnten Journalisten die Anmeldung über das Online-Formular nicht abschicken.

Auch wenn in dem Formular die heiklen Daten nicht abgefragt wurden, so halten Experten diese Klausel doch für nicht zulässig.

Nach Informationen der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"" prüfte die Berliner Datenschutzbeauftragte den Vorfall.

But human rights groups and labor organizations like ITUC quickly dismissed what they saw as “cosmetic” changes that would still fail to protect workers.
As recently as December, Amnesty International warned that Qatar’s labor rules would continue to put workers’ rights and health in jeopardy.
We need to see the details of this proposal: what is Qatar’s long term game plan to eradicate modern slavery and other abuses?”Burrow acknowledged that the new reforms will take time to implement and that Qatar’s labor system will not change overnight.
“For all workers who are associated with the infrastructure necessary for the World Cup, it will mean a change from a system of modern slavery to normalized industrial relations,” Burrow told HuffPost.","Qatar, the tiny but wealthy state in the Persian Gulf that will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, announced a series of major reforms on Wednesday, which could put an end to the oppressive “kafala” labor system that international trade unions and human rights groups have long likened to “modern day slavery.”

The package of reforms, according to Qatari state media and labor groups, will establish new protections for Qatar’s migrant workers, including instituting a minimum wage that will no longer discriminate based on race and creating workplace committees with elected labor representatives.

The most significant change, however, may be new rules that will allow Qatar’s roughly two million migrant workers, who make up 95 percent of its labor force, to change jobs or leave the country on their own, without approval from their employer. That sort of control over workers is a defining aspect of Qatar’s “kafala” system, as it binds migrants from India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and various African countries to employers that have near-absolute power over them.

The reforms will “meet the necessary needs of the worker to live at an appropriate humanitarian level,” Dr. Issa Saad Al Jafali Al Nuaimi, the Qatari minister of labor affairs, said Wednesday, according to the state-run Qatar News Agency.

And for once, one of the country’s most vocal critics agreed.

“This is a genuine breakthrough, and signals the end of kafala,” said Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, which has pushed Qatar to modernize its labor system for more than five years and helped negotiate the new reforms.

Global scrutiny of Qatar’s labor system began to intensify in 2010, when FIFA, international soccer’s governing body, awarded the country the right to host the 2022 World Cup. The next year, French soccer player Zahir Belounis was prohibited from leaving the country amid a contract dispute with his club, launching a two-year escape saga that highlighted the horrors of the country’s labor regime.

Human rights groups and international unions said that the persistence of the “modern day slavery” system could lead to the deaths of up to 4,000 migrant laborers working on World Cup-related projects by the time the tournament actually began.

Qatar has failed in previous attempts to address that criticism. In 2014, it announced a series of reforms that officials claimed would end the “kafala” system. But human rights groups and labor organizations like ITUC quickly dismissed what they saw as “cosmetic” changes that would still fail to protect workers.

They have continued to push for reform. In March 2016, all 231 workers interviewed by a researcher from Amnesty International said they had faced abuses ranging from forced labor to the confiscation of their passports to “squalid living conditions.” The next month, a Harvard report called on FIFA to relocate the World Cup if Qatar did not institute substantial reforms to protect workers.

As recently as December, Amnesty International warned that Qatar’s labor rules would continue to put workers’ rights and health in jeopardy. While in September, Human Rights Watch called on the country to institute policies to protect construction workers from the desert nation’s “intense heat and humidity.”

Qatar, meanwhile, is still facing potential sanctions from the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency that in 2016 gave the country a year to end forced labor.

While Burrow and ITUC hailed Qatar’s announcement, others who have pushed for reforms are more hesitant to proclaim the death of “kafala.”

“These [reforms] have a clear potential to have a positive impact on migrant workers’ lives depending on how they’re implemented,” Amnesty International spokesperson Sara Hashash said in an email. But, she added, “I’m afraid we’re not able to assess the significance of all the developments being welcomed by other organizations until we’ve seen the full details of the government’s commitments.”

“In principle it seems to be a positive step,” said Mustafa Qadri, a human rights researcher who interviewed migrant workers in Qatar for Amnesty in 2015. “As ever, however, the devil is in the detail. We need to see the details of this proposal: what is Qatar’s long term game plan to eradicate modern slavery and other abuses?”

Burrow acknowledged that the new reforms will take time to implement and that Qatar’s labor system will not change overnight. But she is “confident” that the policies ― which also mandate government issuance of identification cards, oversight of employment contracts and a new grievance process for employee disputes, according to an ITUC release ― will finally succeed in protecting workers. She emphasizes this is is particularly because the ILO will help provide support the development and implementation of the rules.

“For all workers who are associated with the infrastructure necessary for the World Cup, it will mean a change from a system of modern slavery to normalized industrial relations,” Burrow told HuffPost. “For those specifically working on the World Cup, it gives them confidence that the promises that have been empty to date...will in fact have some legal teeth behind them.”

FIFA has maintained it is committed to workers’ rights but has faced its own criticism and legal challenges over its failure to pressure Qatar to reform. The international soccer governing body did not specifically comment on the new reforms. Though a spokesperson pointed to a previous statement that it “recognises its responsibility to address human rights risks” associated with its events.

FIFA, the spokesperson said, “will continue to engage with the Qatari authorities to build on the initiatives put in place for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and help raise the bar in regards to labour standards across the country.”

Though ITUC will no longer request that the World Cup be moved from Qatar, Burrow said FIFA should claim no credit for the potential abolition of the “kafala” system.",Qatari Labor Reforms Could Finally End 'Modern Day Slavery' For Migrant Workers,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/qatari-labor-reforms-could-finally-end-modern-day-slavery-for-migrant-workers_us_59f0e560e4b043885914cf5d

Sehr gehr geehrter Herr Regierender Bürgermeister,

es gibt Interviews, die liest man und vergisst sie sofort wieder. Und es gibt Interviews, die einen nachdenklich stimmen und im Kopf bleiben. Ihr Interview mit der Berliner Zeitung vom 25. Oktober 2017 hat mich nicht nur nachdenklich gestimmt - es ist an Frechheit nicht zu überbieten!



""Billige Effekthascherei und Polemik"" ist es definitiv nicht, wenn man die anhaltenden Zustände in vielen Bereichen der Stadt kritisiert. ""Billige Effekthascherei und Polemik"" ist es vielmehr, sein eigenes Scheitern als Regierender Bürgermeister unserer Stadt als Erfolg zu verkaufen. Doch natürlich hat auch Berlin ‚Erfolgsgeschichten' vorzuweisen und darauf dürfen wir auch stolz sein!

Sie und Ihre Politik sind Teil des Problems, das bei vielen Menschen zu einem verlorenen Vertrauen in die Politik beiträgt

Der in der Wissenschaft von Ihnen beschriebenen ‚überall bestaunten Entwicklung' der vergangenen Jahre steht eine allgemeine Fehlentwicklung gegenüber, die Sie als ""Privatbürger"" schon lange leider nicht mehr sehen.



Es ist keine Leistung, dass Frau Scheeres für genügend neue Lehrkräfte gesorgt hat, sondern ihre Pflicht als Senatorin. Punkt! Ob sie diese Pflicht rechtzeitig und in genügendem Maß erfüllt hat, soll jeder für sich selbst entscheiden. Doch selbst wenn die Lehrer - zumeist Quereinsteiger - jetzt in den überfüllten, maroden Klassenzimmern stehen, landet unsere Stadt noch immer auf dem letzten Platz in allen Bildungsvergleichen.

Die Ansiedlung des Internet-Instituts macht es auch nicht wieder gut, dass mit dem Bau von bezahlbarem Wohnraum unter einer Senatorin Lompscher noch nicht einmal begonnen wurde - stattdessen holt sie Stasi-Spezi Holm immer wieder in ihr Team, dessen Expertise bislang keine notwendige Wohnung hat entstehen lassen. Der Gast-Dozent, der in die Wissenschaftsstadt Berlin kommt und keine Wohnung findet, wird sich freuen.

Sie verkennen, dass es nicht um ""da werden wir noch besser"" oder ""Schritt für Schritt merken es die Bürger"" geht. Sie und Ihre Politik sind Teil des Problems, das bei vielen Menschen zu einem verlorenen Vertrauen in die Politik beiträgt.

Seit Jahrzehnten regiert Ihre SPD unsere Stadt, die für viele Menschen leider mittlerweile gefühlt ein ""failed state"" ist. Es ist polemisch, wenn man diesen Eindruck nicht durch politisches Handeln entkräftet und bei den Wartezeiten in den Ämtern von ""immerhin halbiert"" spricht.

Sie sind ein politischer Hütchenspieler



Illegale Müllberge auf den Straßen, ein völlig desaströser Justiz-Apparat, eine nicht funktionierende Verwaltung, Armutsmigration aus Osteuropa, die die zuständigen Bezirke nicht allein lösen können und selbst Grüne-Bezirksbürgermeister aus der Not heraus mittlerweile zu politischen Hardlinern werden lässt.

Eine hohe Zahl an Einbrüchen am Stadtrand und tausende, schlecht ausgestattete und bezahlte Polizeibeamte, die zusehen können, wie ihre Kollegen im Nachbarland Brandenburg bereits seit Monaten die versprochene moderne Anti-Terror-Ausrüstung bekommen haben. Ja, es ist richtig, dass die Polizei nicht alles regeln kann, was Sie und Ihr Senat kaputt gemacht haben!

Sie sagen, alles, was hier funktioniert, ist für Deutschland ein Impuls - das ist nur leider nicht unsere Stadt, die wir lieben und mit deren Scheitern in so vielen Bereichen wir tagtäglich leben müssen.

Das merken die Menschen nicht zuletzt gerade bei Tegel: ein SPD-naher Gutachter, der den BER genehmigt hat, soll jetzt neutral entscheiden, ob der Flughafen Tegel offenbleibt. Merken Sie es eigentlich selbst noch, Herr Regierender Bürgermeister?

Sie ändern das Verfahren, ohne mit der Wimper zu zucken. Sie führen eine Entscheidung in der Sache im Abgeordnetenhaus herbei, obwohl diese Sachfrage längst von einer Mehrheit von knapp einer Millionen Menschen, verbunden mit einem klaren Auftrag zur Offenhaltung von TXL beantwortet wurde.

Um es mit den Worten Ihres Kollegen Raed Salehs zu sagen: Sie sind ein politischer Hütchenspieler. Ein politischer Hütchenspieler, der meint, mit einer arroganten Geste diesen klaren Sachauftrag der Berlinerinnen und Berliner einfach wegwischen zu können.



Diesen Auftrag haben Sie Ihnen nicht zuletzt auch gegeben, weil in der Luftfahrt keiner an Ihre Kompetenz glaubt, den BER zu eröffnen und den Luftverkehrsstandort Berlin zu stärken. Die Verantwortung im Aufsichtsrat haben Sie ja bereits abgegeben. Den Arbeitsnachweis Ihrer SPD-Regierungszeit dürfen jetzt nicht zuletzt die Mitarbeiter von Air Berlin erleben.

Als Bundesratspräsident wollen Sie ""Berlin als Brennpunkt solcher Entwicklungen"" einbringen. Meinen Sie damit die Brennpunkte Tiergarten, Kottbuser Tor oder Hermannplatz? Meinen Sie den Brennpunkt Schulen? Meinen Sie den Brennpunkt Verwaltung? Welchen der vielen Brennpunkte meinen Sie?



Damit Ihre Zeit als Regierender Bürgermeister nicht als Brennpunkt unserer Stadtgeschichte in eben diese eingeht, sollten Sie endlich die großen Probleme unserer Stadt angehen - oder Ihren Platz für einen fähigeren Kollegen freimachen.

""Dos que deben hablar y uno que debe guardar silencio"", atacan al nacionalista flamenco que abrió la polémica.","Carles Puigdemont es el protagonista indiscutible de la prensa belga de hoy. Una crisis internacional como la catalana se ha acabado convirtiendo en un asunto doméstico de primer orden, que amenaza con desatar una tempestad en el complejo Gobierno de coalición del primer ministro Charles Michel e, incluso, con costarle un roce diplomático con otro estado miembro de la UE, España.

Ayer, los medios locales se hacían eco de la propuesta del secretario de Estado belga de Migración y Asilo, Theo Francken, del partido independentista flamenco N-VA, quien señaló la opción de que Puigdemont solicitarse ""asilo político"" en su país. Quedó en una declaración, sin más calado, de un político controvertido, conocido por sus declaraciones llamativas e incómodas, como se puede leer en este hilo de la periodista Beatriz Ríos.

Ahora que estáis empezando a conocer a Theo Francken en España, os cuento un par de cosas sobre su trayectoria. Hilo: — Beatriz Ríos (@BeaRios_) 30 de octubre de 2017

Sin embargo, la confirmación de que Puigdemont se encontraba en Bruselas junto a cinco de sus cesados consejeros, con la idea de pedir asilo en Bélgica, ha desatado la locura en los medios y en sus redes sociales, hasta en los más pequeños y locales. En esta tarde-noche, una idea domina las principales cabeceras y telediarios: que los nacionalistas flamencos, que se supone que son el apoyo del catalán y su delegación en el país, se desvinculan por completo del viaje.

El N-VA, que forma parte de la coalición del Gobierno belga, afirma que el viaje de Puigdemont no responde a una invitación del partido, según ha confirmado el portavoz, Joachim Pohlmann. ""Nosotros no le invitamos. No tengo ni idea de con quién se va a reunir"", ha dicho en declaraciones a la agencia AFP, que abren cada web y cada noticiario. A su vez, los medios destacan lo filtrado por fuentes del gabinete Jan Jambon, ministro del Interior y miembro de la misma formación, que aseguran que ""no está al tanto"" de la visita y que no ha hablado con Puigdemont en los últimos días.

""El N-VA desmiente toda implicación en la visita de Puigdemont a Bruselas"", escribe 'Le Soir'.

Diarios como Le Soir están destacando los mensajes de partidos de la oposición que reclaman a Michel, el primer ministro, respuestas claras sobre su postura ante el caso Puigdemont, su hipotética petición de asilo y el respaldo a la posición del Gobierno centra, aliado en Europa.

2/2 Il en va de la crédibilité internationale de la Belgique. — Elio Di Rupo (@eliodirupo) 30 de octubre de 2017

""Está en juego la credibilidad internacional de Bélgica"", destaca el diario, que acompaña la información principal con un análisis en el que resalta la ""imposibilidad"" de que Puigdemont pida asilo, ya que España es un país ""democrático y garantista de los Derechos Humanos"", como todos los de la UE lo son por fuerza, por lo que su petición no casaría con la de un refugiado al uso. Añade entrevistas con historiadores que reconocen que las palabras de ayer de Francken han ""tocado los corazones nacionalistas"", por lo que puede haber un apoyo en las bases de estos partidos e incluso una simpatía popular hacia la causa del nacionalismo catalán, pero nada que pueda cuajar en un asilo. ""¡Pero qué estupidez!"", resume una de sus columnistas, por contra, avalando el ""diálogo"" entre Madrid y Barcelona y recordando que, a horas antes de la visita de Puigdemont, ""miles de personas se manifestaban en otro sentido en Barcelona"".

El De Standaard reconoce que es ""muy difícil"" que prospere una petición de asilo, por los mismos motivos que explica el diario anterior, y entiende que la idea de que Puigdemont pueda estar montando un gobierno en el exilio es ""arriesgada"" y con pocos visos de prosperar.

A beauty pageant, slated to be held in Vishakhapatnam on 11 November, was cancelled following fierce protests from women's groups in the city. It was not the first time that the 'Miss Vizag' contest was being held in the city, however, this was the first time that it was being promoted with the 'Save the Girl Child' tagline.

On 14 October, Andhra HRD minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao released the poster of the contest in a ceremonial launch, leading to a spate of protests.

Newsminute reports: ""Activists of multiple women's groups such as the All India Democratic Womens Association (AIDWA), the Progressive Women's Organisation (PWO), the AP Mahila Samakya and the Chaitanya Mahila Sangam (CMS) took out a protest rally.""

The protesters have contended that it was hypocritical to associate a beauty pageant with the 'Save the Girl Child' issue. They pointed out that an exercise which according to them revolved around blatantly objectifying a woman's body is against the spirit of 'Save the Girl Child'.

RN Madhavi, AIDWA Vishakapatnam Secretary told Newsminute, ""In the name of the 'Save the girl child' campaign, they (the government) want to entertain multinational companies that want to make money out of women's bodies.""

The Hans India reports that the organises temporarily cancelled the auditions and postponed the event after women's rights activists turned up in front of the hotel where auditions were supposed to be held and protested, shouting slogans. The women's groups also threatened that if the contest is not scrapped, they will organise a demonstration in front of the HRD minister's house.

The website 'Hans India' demanded that the organisers 'apologise' to women and chided the government for organising a 'bikini festival' in the garb of organising a 'beach festival' to promote tourism, making swimsuits sound like some sort of an aberration.

According to its Facebook page, the event is in its 19th year in Vizag and its conceptualised by Creative Plus Entertainment Network.

The page also has pictures of former contests and winners.

Von Januar bis Dezember räkelt sich eine andere Traumfrau auf der Motorhaube, als hätte sie nicht verstanden, wie sie anders in den Innenraum des Autos gelangen soll. Frauen werden seit der Erfindung des Rades des völligen Unverständnisses für die Männerträume auf vier Reifen verdächtigt. Wohl kaum ein anderes Klischee hat es in der Popkultur derart weit gebracht und wird so häufig in Büchern, Filmen und augenrollenden Gesprächen thematisiert. Dass Frauen durchaus etwas mit Autos anfangen können und was an den größten Mythen dran ist, zeigt unser Vorurteilscheck in Zusammenarbeit mit der Allianz.

Mythos 1: Tücke der Parklücke – Frauen können nicht einparken

Es ist der Klassiker der Klischees: Frauen können ohne lastergroße Lücken und unendliche Weiten zum mehrzügigen Rangieren einfach nicht einparken. Der Mythos mangelnder weiblicher Parkkünste hält sich hartnäckig, dabei erheben sich aus Studien protestierende Gegenstimmen. So zeigten beispielsweise Untersuchungen der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, dass vor allem das negative Selbstbild der Fahrerinnen zu schlechten Parkergebnissen führe. Andere Studien beschäftigten sich mit dem sozialpsychologischen Phänomen der „Bedrohung durch Stereotypen“. Die Tatsache, dass Frauen sich am Steuer ständig mit dem Vorurteil vermeintlicher Parkunfähigkeit konfrontiert sehen, verunsichert und schafft Misstrauen gegenüber den eigenen Fahrkünsten. Ein britischer Parkplatz-Betreiber will sogar herausgefunden haben, dass sich Männer einfach schneller mit ihrer Parkleistung zufriedengeben. Frauen hingegen strebten nach Perfektion und bräuchten dementsprechend länger. Die Mutter aller Mythen fußt somit auf vorurteilsbedingtem Mangel an Selbstbewusstsein bei Frauen und der unbescheidenen männlichen Begeisterung über die eigenen Parkfertigkeiten. Als Gegenmittel empfehlen wie den Damen an dieser Stelle, nie müde zu werden, süffisant grinsende Fahrer auf ihr schief geparktes Auto hinzuweisen.

Mythos 2: Spaß am Gas – Frauen kennen keine Fahrfreude

Während der Gedanke an Pferdestärken männliches Blut zur Wallung bringt, können Frauen darüber nun wirklich nicht jubilieren. Bei diesem Vorurteil scheint die Zeit irgendwann in den 1950er Jahren stehengeblieben zu sein. Das Klischee, der unmotivierte Fahrer vor dem eigenen Auto müsse ein Opa mit Hut oder eine Frau sein, kann relativ leicht ausgehebelt werden. Eine Umfrage des Autobauers Ford ergab Anfang des Jahres beispielsweise, dass Männer und Frauen bei der Fahrt eines schnittigen Sportwagens den gleichen Fahrspaß empfinden. Die Emanzipation ist längst am Gas-Pedal angekommen und so genießen auch Fahrerinnen den Sprint über die Straße. Zwar sind die Männer in Flensburg punktemäßig stärker vertreten, allerdings ist das häufigste Vergehen unter weiblichen Punktesünderinnen die zu schnelle Fahrt. Doch wehe dem, der da jetzt den Finger hebt und auf ein erhöhtes Unfallpotenzial verweist. Die Verkehrsunfallszahlen des Statistischen Bundeamtes beweisen regelmäßig, dass Frauen weniger unfallanfällig sind als Männer. Eine gute Kfz-Versicherung ist hingegen geschlechtsunabhängig der Garant für Fahrspaß mit sicherem Gefühl. Die Allianz bietet dazu individuellen Schutz für jeden Fahrer – und jede Fahrerin.

Mythos 3: Porsche statt Püppchen – Mädchen spielen nicht mit Autos

Wie viel neidisches Gebrüll mag es unter Weihnachtsbäumen schon gegeben haben, wie viele tränennasse Puppenkleidchen angesichts von vier Kubikmetern Lego und den Rennstrecken großer Brüder. Doch da lässt sich leider nichts machen, denn Barbie und Co. sind die idealen Spielsachen für Mädchen. Dass dieser Mythos eher von klassischen Rollenbildern als kindlichen Neigungen am Leben gehalten wird, zeigen verschiedene Erhebungen. Dem Bundesverband des Spielwareneinzelhandels zufolge gibt es immer mehr Mädchen, die lieber mit Autos spielen. Studien zufolge fördere der Rollentausch von Miniatur-Schönheitssalon und Rennbahn die kognitive und emotionale Entwicklung. Gewisse Vorlieben lassen sich natürlich nicht absprechen, doch freuen sich auch die meisten Prinzessinnen über Rennautos. Ein Experiment der französischen Supermarktkette Les Magasins U kommt zu einem ganz ähnlichen Ergebnis. Kaum waren Jungs und Mädchen mit der vollen Bandbreite von Auto bis Zauber-Barbie allein, griffen kleine Superhelden zu Puppen, Mädchen nach Bohrmaschinen und Bentleys.

Mythos 4: Wo bin ich? Frauen haben keinen Orientierungssinn

Wenn es einen Zusammenhang gibt, über den sich Wissenschaftler nicht einigen können, dann ist es der zwischen Geschlecht und Orientierungssinn. Den Wissenschaftlern der Norwegian University of Science and Technology zufolge sind Männer dank des Testosterons und der Orientierung an Himmelsrichtungen im Orientierungsvorteil. Frauen orientierten sich eher an festen Wegpunkten. Zwei Wissenschaftlerinnen der University of Edinburgh zufolge bietet dieser Umstand jedoch auch Vorteile. Zwar hätten Frauen ein schlechteres Gedächtnis für räumliche Anordnungen, doch gewährt die Navigation nach optischen Fixpunkten in mancher Umgebung bessere Auskunft. Dass sich Männer und Frauen unterschiedlich orientieren, setzt sich übrigens auch bei Ahnungslosigkeit fort. Eine Studie des Instituts Fly Research belegte die männliche Unbelehrbarkeit. Demnach nimmt jeder Vierte eine halbstündige Irrfahrt mit ungeahntem Ausgang in Kauf, bevor er nach dem Weg fragt.

Mythos 5: Fluchen und Funkeln – Männer donnern, Frauen dekorieren

Müssten Eigenschaften wie das Anschreien anderer Autofahrer oder Faustschwenken vor dem Abbiegen einem Geschlecht zugeordnet werden – die meisten würden auf die Männerwelt tippen. Doch eine Studie der Scout24-Gruppe wies nicht nur die Deutschen als Fluch-Europameister aus, sondern krönte zudem die Frauen zum fluchenden Geschlecht, das deinem Ärger lautstark Luft macht. Da wir schon einmal beim Thema Luft sind, ein dekoratives Vorurteil ist nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen. Ob Duftbäume mit Käsekuchen-Aroma, Kinderschühchen und Einhörner, die es zur 50 Liter Tankfüllung gratis dazu gab: Frauen stehen im Verdacht, ihren Rückspiegel als eine Art Hort für jegliches Sammelsurium zu nutzen. Das Resultat: Beim Fahren schwankt und funkelt allerhand am Rückspiegel und irritiert weit über die Grenzen des eigenen Autos hinaus. Beim Blick in manches Auto fällt es schwer, diesen Mythos auszuhebeln.

Alles andere als mythisch: Gut versichert mit der Allianz

Frauen beweisen Freude am Fahren, parken fluchend doch perfekt ein und beschäftigen sich durchaus mit ihren Autos. Doch für jeden Fahrer und jede Fahrerin gilt: Nur mit einer guten Kfz-Versicherung fährt es sich auf Nummer sicher. Die Kfz-Versicherung der Allianz ist als zuverlässiger Partner immer mit am Steuer.

Klaus wendet bei ihr den sogenannten Tennislehrer-Trick an

Als die beiden in der Küche sind, wird es heiß

Bauer Klaus sprüht in der aktuellen Folge ""Bauer sucht Frau"" nur so vor Testosteron, denn die thailändische Kandidatin Tiwaporn hat es ihm angetan. So heißt sie übrigens wirklich. Eigentlich ganz leicht zu merken: Nicht Youporn, sondern Tiwaporn.

Tiwaporn scheint sich ebenfalls zu Klaus hingezogen zu fühlen. Das liegt allerdings auch an den Tricks, die der listige Bauer anwendet. Als die beiden den Stall ausmisten, erklärt Klaus seiner Tiwaporn noch einmal ganz genau, wie das mit der Mistgabel funktioniert. Dazu stellt er sich natürlich hinter Tiwaporn und hilft ihr von hinten beim Führen der Mistgabel. Das ist schließlich gar nicht so einfach.

""Ich habe bei Tiwaporn den Tennislehrer-Trick angewendet"", erklärt er den RTL-Reportern. Tatsächlich ist der Trick Tennis-Spielerinnen nur allzu bekannt. Denn der ein oder andere Lehrer stellt auf ähnliche Weise gerne mal seine Lehrer-Qualitäten unter Beweis - vor allem in klischeehaften Filmen. Oder eben bei ""Bauer sucht Frau"".

Klaus: ""Wie Händchen halten, nur mit Mistgabel""

""Auf diese Weise komme ich Tiwaporn näher"", erklärt Klaus sein ausgefuchstes Vorgehen. ""Das ist wie Händchen halten, nur eben mit einer Mistgabel.""

Und es funktioniert. Tiwaporn ist ganz hingerissen vom intimen Stall-Ausmisten. Als die beiden schließlich in die Küche gehen, wird es richtig heiß. Denn sie gehen Klaus' liebstem Hobby nach: Bauernbrot backen.

Bewundernd sieht Tiwaporn zu, wie leidenschaftlich der Bauer seinen Teig knetet. ""Schneller!"", befiehlt sie. Klaus gehorcht zunächst - doch dann greift er zu einem weiteren gewieften Trick: Er beginnt, Tiwaporn zu bestäuben. Das ist natürlich wörtlich gemeint.

Der flirtbegabte Bauer greift sich eine Hand voll Mehl und stäubt die Thailänderin ein. Sie kichert und die Bestäubung nimmt ihren Lauf.

Und auch das Bauernbrot ist ein voller Erfolg: Sehr knackig und sehr braun (also gut, ein bisschen verbrannt) kommt es aus dem Ofen. Jetzt fehlen eigentlich nur noch die Kinder. Bis dahin müssen die beiden das ganze Bauernbrot allein vernaschen.

Zuspruch kam aus der Wirtschaft, Kritik von der SPD

Kaum ist die große Koalition Geschichte, wird eines ihrer Rentenprojekte zerpflückt: die Rente mit 63.

CDU-Präsidiumsmitglied Jens Spahn verlangte in der ""Rheinischen Post"" ihre Abschaffung. Diese ""Form der Frühverrentung"" sollte auslaufen und das Geld lieber in die Renten von Witwen und Erwerbsgeminderten investiert werden, argumentierte er. ""Die Rente mit 63 für langjährig Versicherte wird vor allem von männlichen Facharbeitern genutzt, die wir eigentlich noch brauchen.""

IW-Direktor ist für die Abschaffung

Der Direktor des arbeitgebernahen Instituts der deutschen Wirtschaft (IW) Köln, Michael Hüther, sagte der ""Welt"", die Rente mit 63 müsse ""rückabgewickelt"" werden. Mehr als 200.000 Arbeitskräfte hätten deswegen schon zu arbeiten aufgehört – alles gut verdienende Menschen mit mittlerer und höherer Bildung.

""Wenn ich Grüne und FDP wäre, würde ich die Union da vor mir hertreiben"", sagte Hüther mit Blick auf die Jamaika-Sondierungen. Zudem müsse man darüber nachdenken, ab 2029 das Renteneintrittsalter auch über 67 Jahre hinaus zu erhöhen.

Nach Angaben der Deutschen Rentenversicherung Bund haben bis Ende August 160.000 Versicherte einen Antrag auf abschlagsfreie Rente mit 63 gestellt. Im Vorjahreszeitraum waren es noch 165.000.

Kritik von der SPD

Wer mindestens 45 Jahre in die Rentenversicherung eingezahlt hat, kann seit Juli 2014 ab 63 Jahren ohne Abschlag in Rente gehen. Allerdings wird diese Altersgrenze seitdem pro Jahr um zwei Monate angehoben, so dass die Jahrgänge ab 1964 erst mit 65 nach 45 Jahren abschlagsfrei in Renten gehen können. Die ""Rente mit 63"" ist insofern etwas missverständlich.

Die frühere Bundesfamilienministerin Manuela Schwesig (SPD) wies den Vorstoß Spahns zurück. ""Das zeigt, wie die CDU heute tickt. Da ist mehr soziale Kälte als soziale Verantwortung zu spüren"", sagte sie dem SWR.

Das Vorstandsmitglied des Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (DGB), Annelie Buntenbach, hielt Spahn entgegen: ""Wer die Rente mit 63 zurückdrehen will, ignoriert schlicht die Lebenswirklichkeit vieler Menschen. Wir brauchen nicht weniger Möglichkeiten für Beschäftigte, vor dem 67. Lebensjahr in Rente gehen zu können, sondern mehr."" Viele erreichten heute schon den regulären Rentenbeginn nicht.

Der Wirtschaftsrat der CDU sieht in einem Jamaika-Bündnis die große Chance, das SPD-Projekt der Rente mit 63 zu beerdigen, und unterstützt den Vorstoß Spahns.

Die Mütterrente

Die CSU wollte in den Jamaika-Sondierungen auch eine weitere Erhöhung der Mütterrente fordern. Dabei geht es um Mütter, deren Kinder vor 1992 geboren wurden. Sie sollen einen Rentenpunkt mehr bekommen und damit genauso viel wie Mütter, deren Kinder nach diesem Datum geboren wurden. Ein Rentenpunkt für diese Frauen kostet zwischen sechs und sieben Milliarden Euro.

Die Grünen-Fraktionsvorsitzende Katrin Göring-Eckardt sagte im ARD-""Morgenmagazin"": ""Für mich ist das Entscheidende, dass wir keine Altersarmut mehr haben."" Die Mütterrente sei dafür nicht das richtige Instrument. Besser wäre eine ""Garantierente"". Wer lange gearbeitet habe, solle mehr haben als die Grundsicherung.

Die Präsidentin des Sozialverbands VdK, Ulrike Mascher, forderte die vollständige Angleichung der Mütterrente sowie eine Stabilisierung des Rentenniveaus und dessen Anhebung auf 50 Prozent.

MORE news: Twitter uncovered more accounts linked to Internet Research Agency—# now stands at 2,752, up from 201 https://t.co/sPgMdsDXHg — Natasha Bertrand (@NatashaBertrand) October 30, 2017

Facebook's general counsel, Colin Stretch, said in the written testimony that the 80,000 posts from Russia's Internet Research Agency were a tiny fraction of content on Facebook, equal to one out of 23,000 posts.

However, the posts violated Facebook's terms of service, and any amount of such activity using fake accounts is too much, Stretch wrote.

""These actions run counter to Facebook's mission of building community and everything we stand for. And we are determined to do everything we can to address this new threat,"" he wrote.

The 80,000 posts were published between June 2015 and August 2017. Most of them focused on divisive social and political messages such as race relations and gun rights, Facebook said.

Twitter's revised estimate of how many Russia-linked accounts were on its service comes a month after an influential Democratic senator, Mark Warner, slammed the company for what he called an insufficient internal investigation.

El primero en llegar a la meta, y por lo tanto vencedor del GP de México, fue el jovencito Max Verstappen (Red Bull), seguido de Valterri Bottas (Mercedes) y Kimi Raikkonen (McLaren). Sebastian Vettel era el único con posibilidades de quitar el cetro mundial a Hamilton. Esto sucedería si hubiera llegado en primer lugar, sin embargo llegó en cuarto.

Que Hamilton obtuviera su cuarto mundial era esperado, entonces la nota fue que el jovencito Verstappen viene con todo. La salida fue uno de los momentos más emocionantes del domingo. Se puede interpretar que Verstappen, con un par de movimientos agresivos que le suelen caracterizar, provocó un roce de coches entre Hamilton y Vettel, obligándolos (sin ser sancionado) a regresar a pitts a resolver problemas con sus autos. Mientras, el holandés se hizo del primer lugar y comunicó a su equipo su hazaña: ""Simply, simply lovely"". Aquí Alex García, de El Confidencial, hace una interpretación sobre este comentario.

Son décès, qui intervient à quelques mois du cinquantième anniversaire du mouvement de contestation de Mai 68, a été confirmé au Monde par sa famille.

Né à Dijon le 16 avril 1943, issu d'une famille paysanne et catholique, petit-fils d'un maréchal-ferrant et fils d'un employé de la SNCF, Jacques Sauvageot est mort des suites d'un accident de la circulation survenu en septembre. Il était depuis lors hospitalisé à Paris, sans connaissance, selon l'ITS, qui fait vivre l'héritage du Parti socialiste unifié (PSU), dissous en 1989.

Le plus discret du trio

Avec Alain Geismar et Daniel Cohn-Bendit, ce licencié en lettres et en histoire de l'art forma le trio vedette qui ébranla le pouvoir gaulliste. Il était le plus mystérieux et le plus discret des trois, refusant longtemps, dans les années qui suivirent, qu'on le filme ou qu'on l'interviewe.

Jacques Sauvageot, devenu directeur régional de l'école des Beaux-Arts de Rennes, avait toutefois rompu le silence dans les années 90: Mai 68 est un véritable ""mythe fondateur"", à la source des ""radios libres comme du féminisme, de l'émergence de la société civile comme de la critique du socialisme réel"", déclarait-il en mai 1993 dans un entretien à l'AFP.

Jugeant alors que ""le pouvoir n'a jamais été à prendre"" et que les événements n'avaient pas été si violents en 1968, il gardait comme meilleur souvenir le meeting au stade Charléty, à Paris, le 27 mai: ""on avait l'impression d'une rivière qui se gonflait de dizaines de petits torrents, de petits ruisseaux"" avec les ouvriers grévistes, les étudiants, les militants révolutionnaires et les politiciens de gauche chevronnés, tous unis dans le même enthousiasme.

Il confiait également n'éprouver aucune nostalgie pour ""le joli mois de mai"" et n'avoir ""jamais revu"" ses deux célèbres compagnons de route.

TT News Agency / Reuters Journalist Kim Wall's dismembered body was found in August

Post-mortem evidence showed Wall was stabbed in her ribcage and genitals “around or shortly after her death.” The police said they would now extend the charges against Madsen - which already include murder and mutilating Wall’s body - to include sexual assault without intercourse, based on 14 interior and exterior stab wounds to the journalist’s genitals. “Kim Wall had suffered 14 stabs in and around the genitals and it is due to these stabs that we have said that there must have been a sexual motive,” police spokesman Jens Moller Jensen told journalists in Copenhagen. The cause of death was still unknown, said Jensen. Madsen, who had earlier claimed he dropped Wall off alive in Copenhage, also denies the sexual assault charges.

A Washington Post/ABC News poll taken last spring put Trump’s approval rating even lower ― at 36 percent. That was the lowest of any president in polls dating back 70 years. At the same time in their presidencies, former President Barack Obama and George W. Bush had approval ratings of 59 percent.

The NBC News/WSJ poll noted that Trump’s approval rating fared better in two areas. On the economy, 42 percent of respondents said they approved of the president’s handling while 37percent disapproved. And 48 percent of respondents said they approved of how Trump managed the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and Irma while 28 percent said they disapproved.

But when it came to Trump’s handling of his role as commander-in-chief or the situation in North Korea, the president’s approval rating dipped to 35 percent and 34 percent, respectively.

The NBC News/WSJ poll surveyed Americans during the same time period that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) announced he would not seek re-election and harshly criticized the president’s behavior as “outrageous” and “dangerous to democracy.” Flake’s takedown followed that of Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has publicly feuded with Trump for weeks. Corker also announced he would not seek re-election.","Donald Trump's Approval Rating Hits New Low, Poll Finds",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-trump-approval-rating-new-low_us_59f6b435e4b03cd20b827ec0

What is apple cider vinegar?
""Apple cider vinegar is made by fermenting apple cider in a two-step process.
""Apple cider vinegar is basically fermented apples or apple cider which then become acetic acid (the main ingredient in vinegar) by adding bacteria.
""There is limited research to support the role of apple cider vinegar in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in humans.","Whether it's tossed through a salad, mixed with water or simply enjoyed tolerated on its own, apple cider vinegar is popular in the natural health and food world.

And with the claimed benefits including weight loss and improving diabetes, it's no wonder people are including apple cider vinegar into their daily routine.

For those who are sitting on the fence about apple cider vinegar, or who just don't know much about the sour stuff, here's an explainer on what apple cider vinegar is, its benefits (and whether they're actually backed up by science) and ways to consume it.

What is apple cider vinegar? How is it different from normal vinegar?

There's quite a difference between apple cider vinegar (also known as ACV) and regular white vinegar you use to drizzle on your hot chips or clean the house with.

""Apple cider vinegar is made by fermenting apple cider in a two-step process. First, apple juice is fermented into alcohol and then the alcohol is fermented into vinegar,"" Jessica Spendlove, accredited practising dietitian and athletic performance dietitian, told HuffPost Australia.

""Apple cider vinegar is basically fermented apples or apple cider which then become acetic acid (the main ingredient in vinegar) by adding bacteria.

""It differs from regular vinegars because it's made from apple must or apple cider, whereas many common varieties are made from grape must, wine or grains.""

What does apple cider vinegar contain nutrition-wise?

Looking at apple cider vinegar from a nutrition point of view, ACV contains probiotics and some antioxidant properties.

""It is really low in energy at approximately 12 kilojoules (three calories) per tablespoon, which is mostly carbohydrate. Certain types will have small amounts of antioxidants and amino acids, and most contain trace amounts of potassium,"" Spendlove said.

""Organic unfiltered varieties contain 'mother', which is basically protein, enzymes and good bacteria (probiotics).""

What are the benefits of drinking apple cider vinegar?

Apple cider vinegar is said to help with weight loss, blood sugar levels, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but are these claims backed up by science?

""Some are, some aren't,"" Spendlove explained.

""The improvements in blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity, and subsequent benefits in diabetes management, are the health benefits most strongly supported by scientific evidence.""

This reduction in blood sugar and insulin levels post-eating may contribute to feeling full and thus eating less.

ACV with ""mother"" is cloudier than plain vinegar.

""There is some evidence to suggest apple cider vinegar may be beneficial in weight loss due to increasing the feeling of fullness and therefore eating less calories overall,"" Spendlove said. ""Only modest weight loss was shown over a period of 12 weeks.

""There is limited research to support the role of apple cider vinegar in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in humans. Some studies show this benefit in animals; however, this on its own cannot be applied to humans.""

Essentially, apple cider vinegar is ""by no means a magic ingredient for weight loss on its own"", but it may help some people lose weight in combination with good diet and regular exercise.

Does apple cider vinegar have negative effects?

In modest amounts of up to 1-2 (diluted) tablespoons per day there are no known harmful effects, Spendlove explained.

""In large doses, however, there are possible negative effects of ACV. It may cause gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and worsening of symptoms in those with gastroparesis due to delayed stomach emptying.

""Due to the high acid content, excess apple cider vinegar consumption may contribute to erosion of tooth enamel and may cause oesophageal irritation or burns in large doses.""

Try adding a couple of teaspoons of ACV to fruit-infused water.

What are the best ways to consume apple cider vinegar?

For those wanting to include apple cider vinegar in their day, it's best to start slowly (say, one teaspoon) and definitely don't drink it straight (see above for tooth enamel erosion). For the most benefits, choose unfiltered apple cider vinegar with the ""mother"".

""Like any vinegar, you definitely wouldn't drink it straight,"" Spendlove said.

""It can be used as a salad dressing. A nice way to consume it is mixed 50/50 with extra virgin olive oil. You can dilute with water for a beverage and you can also consume it in tablet form.""",Is Apple Cider Vinegar Good For You?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/30/is-apple-cider-vinegar-good-for-you_a_23260102/

In a video released last week, farm manager Chris Loubser said the recent murder of Joubert Conradie on his property in Stellenbosch left him ""feeling powerless"". He added that ""if [he were] a magician, the whole City of Cape Town would've been surrounded by tractors"" for the farming community to be heard.



Dismay over the alleged decline in safety on farms was last week voiced by multiple organisations following the release of the annual crime statistics in which figures for farm attacks and murders were omitted.

In response to criticism from Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald, who said police had promised last year the figures would be released, Minister Fikile Mbalula said he was not aware such an arrangement had been made.

""We must never give the impression that there are certain things we are running away from. If something's been agreed to, we must honour it,"" he said.

Damned statistics

Unlike the national murder rate, which last week was revealed as 34.2 murders per 100,000 people, the so-called ""farm murder rate"" remains opaque. Figures presented in Parliament earlier this year, and since, show significant disparities, implying notably different assessments of the severity of the phenomenon.

Groenewald, in Parliament in April, claimed the farm murder rate was 133 per 100,000, and said his figures were based on broad estimates by Dr Johan Burger at the Institute for Security Studies. Shortly after, the ACDP's Steve Swart claimed the figure was ""almost three times the average"" at 97 per 100,000. According to Talk Radio 702's Bongani Bingwa, who interviewed Burger on the topic last week, others have claimed the rate is markedly lower.

According to AfricaCheck, a statistically robust assessment of the farm-murder rate at present is a complicated task given multiple definitions, whom the statistics include or exclude, and potentially incomplete reporting, or reporting over different periods.

Accurately calculating the farm murder and attack rates, consequently, is ""near impossible"", according to AfricaCheck's Kate Wilkinson based on experts' analysis of available information.

In light of the challenge of statistics, agricultural unions or interest groups with closer proximity to farmers have long collected their own data on farm attacks and murders.

According to Transvaal Agricultural Union's Chris van Zyl, the union's database indicates a total of 65 murders on farms and 347 attacks so far in 2017. Figures provided to HuffPost SA by AfriForum Research Institute (ANI) Lorraine Claasen are about the same, with 67 murders and 349 attacks on farms, which Claasen said were ""conservative estimates"".



'Not a day goes by without reports of farm murders'

Independent crime analyst Chris de Kock told HuffPost SA that, despite the absence of national statistics, he strongly believes the total number of people killed and attacked on farms will increase notably by end 2017.



""If you look across some media, there's not a day that goes by without one of these incidents on the front page or first three pages. This to me suggests, preliminarily, there is likely to be an increase. I can't believe there won't be an increase,"" he said.

I think we are going to see a bad year... and we already had a bad year in 2016/17. Chris De Kock, Independent Crime Analyst

De Kock's suggestion is corroborated by the data provided by the Transvaal Agricultural Union whose figures, collected since 1990, showed a considerable spike in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, followed by a substantial drop and, from approximately 2011, a creeping increase.



Their figures state 71 farm murders were recorded in 2016, which implies this year's figures -- with two months left in the year -- are likely to top 2016's.

""I expected to see an increase in attacks for the remainder of the year,"" Claasen told HuffPost SA.

""November and December are usually months that show an increase in these crimes and this year will be no different. It is, therefore, an urgent matter to address on all levels"".

TAU SA's Van Zyl said the organisation believes the combatting of rural crime, with particular emphasis on farm ""attacks"" and murders, ""is not receiving the priority attention it deserves"".

""Farm attacks were declared a national priority crime way back in 1998... [but] it is doubted whether at SAPS station level the 'priority crime status' is actively applied. It is quite clear that the allocation of personnel and logistics, as well as the services of Crime Intelligence, is equally neglected,"" he said.



AfriForum's Navorsing Institute's (Research Institute) Claasen said farm workers and owners ""have not had a good night's rest in a long time"" and that they have to be ""extremely vigilant and on high alert regarding their own safety 24/7"".

With the end of the year approaching, Claasen said the group's research institute will release a full report on 2017 in the new year ""which will include reliable figures and further breakdowns similar to our previous reports"".

The charge of 'white genocide' and 'double standards'

Despite ostensibly rising figures of attacks and murders on farms, the Black Monday protest hoping to draw attention to these crimes has also been met with stern criticism, with some alleging it places much greater emphasis on white victims of attacks and murders in rural areas.

The realest I know 👊🏾🇿🇦 pic.twitter.com/jGv3StYfOO — Modern Day Bilquis👑 (@MissMnotho) October 30, 2017

A post on Facebook that went viral, published by a Nigel Branken, details the story of Tebogo Ndlovu, who was reportedly shot in the leg by a farmer for stealing oranges and whose body is yet to be found.

Branken wrote, ""Despite there being a higher incidence of farm murders on white farmers than murders in the general population, black South Africa's are still more likely to fall victim to violent crime in South Africa. On Monday, some farmers are telling us to all stop and be concerned about a certain small group of victims ... white victims..."".

He went on: ""A narrative has been created that there is an onslaught against white farmers and that they are the most vulnerable in South Africa. Despite some taking to social media to tell us of a so called ""white-genocide"" and new ""swart-gevaar""; (black-danger), this allegation has been fact checked and repeatedly debunked"".

Burger, speaking to Bongani Bingwa on 702 last week, said farm attacks in general are not just about the farmers. ""Every year there are far more black workers killed than white farmers,"" he claimed.

This may be representative of the demographics of the workers on farms as it is with farmers who are still primarily white, but it doesn't mean black farmers and workers aren't killed... It's not about race. Dr Johan Burger, Institute For Security Studies

Burger said he is currently ""challenging a group in court"" accusing him of ""not wanting to agree that its only white people killed on farms... saying that it's white genocide, but this is not what the figures tell""..

""There is this perception and its based on the fact that while most farmers another families are still white and most of the attackers are black, there is this idea that this is a racial thing and I don't think its accurate,"" he said.",Black Monday: Are Farm Murders And Attacks An Escalating Crisis?,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/10/29/black-monday-are-farm-murders-and-attacks-an-escalating-crisis_a_23260143/

The best kind of censorship is the one where a government does not have to lift a finger. It's handed to it on a platter. Stand-up comedian Shyam Rangeela discovered this when his segment was axed from The Great Indian Laughter Challenge aired on STAR TV Network.

Apparently, the network was nervous about the bit where he mimicked Narendra Modi down to the sonorous ""mitron"". STAR has not commented, but Shyam says a few days before the telecast he was told to record again, after omitting Modi. ""The production team told me that the decision to not air my act was taken because the channel feared that it will offend some people and they might protest against them,"" Rangeela told The Wire.

There's no evidence or even allegation that anyone in the PMO strong-armed the network. But, as a BJP leader said in another India, when asked to bend, media is sometimes ready to crawl. And who wants to take the risk of unleashing the dogs of war on social media?

We have been very successful at adroitly fusing the office of the prime minister with the man named Narendra Modi. Thus it's easy to sanctimoniously claim that mocking Modi the man is the same as mocking the office of the prime minister.

We have been very successful at adroitly fusing the office of the prime minister with the man named Narendra Modi

That's exactly what happened when AIB used that Snapchat dog filter on an image of Narendra Modi. The comedy group found an FIR filed against it. Lawyer Abha Singh told India Today TV, ""We need to put an end to such people who for cheap publicity are trying to put up (such images) and hurt the sentiments of the people of this country who have elected Mr Modi as a PM.""

What Singh misses is there is no lèse-majesté law in force here. He is not the King of Thailand. And there is no reason why a man elected by the people cannot be made fun of by some of those same people. One could find the Snapchat filter unfunny, even in very bad taste, but then, if comedy was always tasteful, there would not be much of it.

But what each such episode, no matter what eventually happens with the FIR, does, is it makes the powers-that-be more nervous about stepping on VVIP toes. And weirdly comics like Rangeela find themselves on the frontlines of the freedom of speech debate.

At the MediaRumble conference in New Delhi, AIB's Ashish Shakya said the group understands that figuring out the red line is always a work in progress. ""It's a process that's ongoing and it's not like we are gonna give up. We just have to factor it in and still entertain and still be smart and still be sharp.""

One could find the Snapchat filter unfunny, even in very bad taste, but then, if comedy was always tasteful, there would not be much of it

AIB has obviously done quite well with news comedy and satire. Shakya said each time a Snapchat filter controversy blows up ""people think we are always in trouble, standing outside jail which is not the case. We are free to do our work.""

And they even have allies among politicians. Derek O'Brien and Shashi Tharoor tweeted dog filter Snapchat images of themselves in solidarity. But then again, O'Brien's party, Trinamool Congress, also made news when a Jadavpur University professor was arrested for forwarding a cartoon mocking Mamata Banerjee and the now-departed Mukul Roy. Satire is always funnier when it's not in your own backyard.

It's not that mocking politicians is new. This is a time-honoured tradition. Former prime ministers have found themselves caricatured as the spitting image of roosters, snakes and goats at the hands of cartoonists. But this is the age of social media. A comic jab can go viral in a way an old print cartoon did not. And a stand-up finds himself or herself suddenly seen as the last stand for freedom of expression.

Anuvab Pal, creator of the Amazon web series Going Viral, said wryly India must be the only country where ""What will you get in trouble for?"" is the first question at a comedy panel.

It makes comedy news. Rangeela is on the front page of my local daily newspaper today. But Pal worried that when comedy becomes so tightly associated with freedom of speech, we take the humour out of it. He said if he could help it, he'd do no politics in his act. There's plenty else he finds very funny.

""But I think Indian audiences live in the here and now. And the here and now is what is in the front page of our newspapers. So you bring up a Modi thing, you bring up GST or whatever and immediately everyone starts clapping because this is what is on everyone's consciousness. But you might have very funny things to say about Stonehenge or 19th-century Bengali literature. Biswa Kalyan Rath can spend 20 minutes talking about pomegranates. And be very funny about it.""

It makes comedy news. Rangeela is on the front page of my local daily newspaper today.

That's created quite a comic Catch-22. Rangeela said when he is out performing everyone laps up his Modi routine. The bit axed from the TV show brought the house down when he performed it live in front of celebs like Akshay Kumar. But those are the same bits that give the corporations cold feet.

Shakya said AIB understands that part of this is the price you pay for fame. ""We've been in the news for a while. We've grown tremendously. As a result of the growth you do become a target, a public figure."" And FIRs from offended citizens, he won't say how many, are part of those growing pains. But he added, ""We are bigger than a Snapchat filter, sorry. For everyone else this is a headline or a primetime debate. For us this is our life. This is what we do.""

And, in the end, he said everyone will have to figure out where to draw the red line. Or, in Rangeela's case, have it drawn for them.

But for all those who worry about ruffling political feathers, AIB retweeted a word of advice from a politician.

""I think we need more satire and humour. Humour brings happiness in our lives. Humour is the best healer.""

The person who said that, mitron? Narendra Modi.

Social justice warriors of the future, however cynical they may be about the success of online campaigns, are unlikely to forget the month of October 2017 in a hurry.

What began as a familiar murmur of allegations of sexual harassment against a powerful Hollywood mogul, Harvey Weinstein in this case, at the beginning of the month, soon turned into a deafening roar, a revolt, no less. Women from the entertainment industry began going public with stories of personal humiliation. Each new day brought forth fresh tales of misconduct.

Soon, the electric pulse of the moment had traversed beyond the entertainment industry, on the wings of the hashtag #MeToo, on social media. Women, as well as some men, from all over the world, irrespective of their gender, sexual identity and socio-economic background, began to speak up — not only against the sex offenders but also against the pervasive culture of silence fostered by patriarchy that stifles the voice of the victims.

The onus of shame, as each individual's testimony made clear, laid with the perpetrators of these grievous crimes, not those who have suffered them.

It may take several decades for a mindset to change. The more regressive the thinking, the more stubborn the stain it leaves behind, but once the tables are turned, as the collective outpouring of empathy did in the #MeToo movement, it's hard to rein in those feelings, especially bitter and angry emotions, that were kept forcibly pent up for years, even repressed.

It's not surprising, therefore, that #MeToo has led us to the moment when we confront #HimToo: the names of those accused of sexual misdemeanor. That's precisely what the women who outed Weinstein did. They pulled the plug off the willful blindness of the world, they forced their colleagues to wake up and smell the putrid reality. Since last evening, Raya Sarkar, who calls herself ""an attorney interested in prisoner's rights, reproductive rights and anti-caste jurisprudence"", has taken a plunge on Facebook to unmask sex offenders in some of the most reputed institutions of learning across the world.

In a public post, she has crowdsourced names of members from academia who have allegedly been involved in sexual misconduct with their colleagues or students.

The list begins with historian Dipesh Chakravarty and has, till the time of writing this piece, altogether 60 names, present or past faculty of institutions such as Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jadavpur University, Film and Television Institute of India, and so on.

Only the most disingenuous will feign shock at the length of the list. Sexual exploitation must be the oldest tool in any trade that involves parties placed in a unequal power relationship. Academia is no different, as a blog post by C. Christine Fair on HuffPost on 19 October, which was later taken down, highlighted.

Among the men Fair accused in the piece of sexually abusing her, several are academics, including Nobel Laureates and Ivy League professors, whose actions allegedly scarred her and prevented her from pursuing a career in the sciences productively.

Fair not only recounted in detail the heinous attacks heaped on her person in different circumstances, she also went a step ahead and called out those who were responsible for causing her harm. Her actions would have resonated with many women in academia — from the past, present and future — who have suffered a fate no less wretched.

Some of these women may have raised their voices, knocked on the doors of justice, held their silence for fear of jeopardising their careers or, worse still, simply abandoned their ambitions for another path. In an eloquent and hard-hitting Facebook post, Priyamvada Gopal of Cambridge University, in the UK, revealed, the complexity of what we are staring at:

Whether the grievances of women in academies, or other professional spheres, get due redress or not, one thing is abundantly clear: those who dare speak up against sexual harassment are usually made to bear the brunt of their 'audacity'. In a typical illustration, India saw such a phenomenon play out a few days back, as allegations against Khodu Irani, the owner of a bar in Pune, poured out from women on social media.

Even as stories of Irani's obnoxious behaviour piled up, through anecdotes backed by screenshots, it was invariably the women who were subjected to a trial by fire: a litany of whataboutery, ifs and buts, whys and wherefores, dragged the discourse down to the appalling pits of victim-shaming. If that's the arsenal with which men want to hit out at women speaking about a deeply hurtful private experience, it's not so unusual for women to also want to out and shame their abusers in public.

While a trial by social media may, by no means, be an ideal or legitimate route to justice, it's hard not to see its temptation, especially in a society like India.

While a trial by social media may, by no means, be an ideal or legitimate route to justice, it's hard not to see its temptation, especially in a society like India. Recently, the judiciary of this nation set a shameful example by acquitting a rape convict on the ground that the victim's denial of consent wasn't loud enough — her ""feeble no"", the honourable Delhi High Court decided, was ambiguous.

With such a precedent set by ""due process"", it's not all that difficult to imagine victims taking the law into their own hands and seeking out a version of their wild justice. And social media, with its ever-amplifying reach, is the ideal platform to unleash it.

And yet, to bypass the due process, however imperfect its results may turn out to be, is to also allow room for manipulation and vendetta to muddy an already murky situation. As an appeal by a group of activists on Kafila pointed out, the men who are listed on Facebook are being called sexual harassers ""with no context or explanation,"" and with those ""who have been already found guilty of sexual harassment by due process"" being ""placed on par with unsubstantiated accusations"". As the statement goes on to elaborate,

It worries us that anybody can be named anonymously, with lack of answerability. Where there are genuine complaints, there are institutions and procedures, which we should utilize. We too know the process is harsh and often tilted against the complainant. We remain committed to strengthening these processes. At the same time, abiding by the principles of natural justice, we remain committed to due process, which is fair and just.

The road to justice is a rocky one, especially within a system that often feels designed to derail it due to the forces of patriarchy that overwhelm it. But the good fight, which is embodied in the spirit of equality that feminism wants to usher in, aims to usher in change within the parameters of legitimacy, rather than by endangering it.

The focus, as the principles outlined by the feminists in Kafila put it, should be making the judiciary and other allied arms of the state machinery stronger, rather than weaken it by running kangaroo courts and dispensing an informal 'justice' that is unlikely to bring the real offenders to book. A more effective way ahead may perhaps involve approaching all possible formal channels of complaint, then persist in raising hell — till the bubble that protects male privilege finally shatters.

Problème, lui et ses collègues ont été destitués par le gouvernement Rajoy après la déclaration unilatérale d'indépendance de la Catalogne. Et Josep Rull i Andreu n'a donc techniquement pas le droit d'occuper ces bureaux.

Un des enjeux de ce début de semaine -après un week-end où les deux camps ont campé sur leurs positions- était de savoir si les dirigeants séparatistes destitués allaient tenter de résister en gagnant leurs bureaux. La police catalane a reçu la consigne d'autoriser l'accès aux bureaux des ""conseillers"" (ministres régionaux) pour qu'ils prennent leurs effets personnels. Et en cas de refus de quitter les lieux, les policiers doivent dresser un PV à transmettre à la justice.

La réponse est aussi venue de Carles Puigdemont, le président de la région, qui a publié sur Instagram une photo prise à l'intérieur du Palais de la Généralité de Catalogne à Barcelone, notent nos confrères du HuffPost Espagne. ""Bonne journée"", dit la légende accompagnée d'un smiley.

Bon dia 😊 Une publication partagée par Carles Puigdemont (@carlespuigdemont) le 29 Oct. 2017 à 23h39 PDT

Puigdemont ne précise toutefois pas si la photo a été prise ce lundi ou avant. Et la question est légitime, puisqu'une source gouvernementale espagnole a indiqué à l'AFP en début d'après-midi que le président déchu se trouvait lundi... à Bruxelles, où il pourrait demander ""l'asile politique"".

Autre image, partagée par la principale intéressée: l'arrivée à son bureau de Carme Forcadell, présidente du Parlement catalan, elle-aussi destituée. ""Au travail"", dit en substance le message qui accompagne sa vidéo. Une image de normalité, comme une nouvelle marque de défiance à la tutelle de Madrid.

Lundi matin à 9 heures, le drapeau espagnol flottait toujours sur le palais de la Généralité, siège de l'exécutif catalan, devant lequel étaient postés des dizaines de journalistes afin de savoir si oui ou non le président catalan destitué Carles Puigdemont chercherait à reprendre ses fonctions. Reste à connaître la réponse de Madrid qui a fait savoir qu'il ne ferait pas arrêter Puigdemont par la police.

Dimanche, signe d'une région très divisée, des centaines de milliers de partisans de l'unité de l'Espagne sont descendus dans les rues de Barcelone, après les dizaines de milliers qui avaient manifesté leur joie à l'annonce de la naissance de leur ""République"" vendredi.

À peine quelques heures après la proclamation d'indépendance votée au parlement catalan, le gouvernement a mis la région sous tutelle, au titre de l'article 155 de la Constitution, jamais utilisé jusqu'alors. Mariano Rajoy a dissous le parlement et convoqué des élections pour le 21 décembre. Il a destitué Carles Puigdemont et son équipe et la vice-présidente du gouvernement espagnol, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, a été désignée pour diriger la Catalogne.

Plus de pouvoirs, plus de signature, plus de fonds à distribuer

Carles Puigdemont avait appelé samedi ses partisans à s'opposer pacifiquement. ""Puigdemont est et restera le président"" de la Catalogne, a renchéri le vice-président destitué Oriol Junqueras, dans une tribune publiée dimanche. Mais il n'a officiellement plus de pouvoirs, plus de signature, plus de fonds à distribuer. Et le parquet général d'Espagne a prévu d'engager dès cette semaine une procédure judiciaire contre lui pour ""rébellion"", même s'il soupèse aussi des poursuites pour ""sédition"", moins lourdes.

""Nous ne pensons pas qu'il aura les moyens de diriger un gouvernement parallèle"" et ""nous espérons que l'administration, les fonctionnaires en Catalogne, respecteront les mesures qui ont été prises, les ordres, et garantiront les services publics"", a déclaré le ministre espagnol des Affaires étrangères Alfonso Dastis dimanche soir.

Chacun attend en effet de savoir quelle va être l'attitude des quelque 200.000 fonctionnaires, supposés passer sous les ordres de Madrid.

Les Mossos rentrent dans le rang

Tout un symbole: l'ordre a été donné de retirer leur escorte aux dirigeants destitués et d'ôter les photographies de Puigdemont dans les commissariats, a indiqué un porte-parole de la police catalane, dont la direction a été changée.

Un haut responsable indépendantiste voit lui le début d'""une espèce de guerre psychologique"". Evoquant ""un retour à la réalité"", cette source admet que ""le gouvernement de la République n'a pas la capacité de s'imposer"" et de devenir ""un gouvernement étatique"".

Une certaine déception semblait régner dans la mouvance sécessionniste, mobilisée ces dernières années par d'immenses manifestations pacifiques pour réclamer ""l'indépendance maintenant"". Celle qui a été proclamée vendredi n'a été reconnue par aucun Etat à l'étranger et a été vivement contestée, dimanche, dans les rues de Barcelone. Le slogan ""Puigdemont, en prison!"" était régulièrement scandé dans cette marche organisée à l'appel de l'association Société civile catalane.

Je me suis déjà exprimé mille fois, ici et ailleurs, sur les réseaux sociaux et en conférence, par mon métier de baby planner. Je me suis mise à nue au sens propre et figuré... J'ai déjà fait tout ca....

Mon cri ce matin, les chaînes dont je veux me libérer, c'est la culpabilité!

Oui, la culpabilité d'être une pestiférée.

On parle du cancer du sein qui fait des ravages, on incite les femmes au dépistage; toutes unies, toutes responsables. Mais le cancer du col de l'utérus, on en parle? Non.

C'est pourtant le deuxième cancer féminin sur le podium, après celui du sein. Pardon. Je reformule: le deuxième à tuer le plus de femmes. ""Et tout le monde s'en fout"", comme le dirait si bien Fabrice de Boni et Axel Lattuada qui, je l'espère se saisiront du sujet.

Le HPV, l'affaire de tous!

HPV c'est l'acronyme de Human Papilloma Virus. Ce sont des virus qui infectent la peau et les muqueuses. L'infection peut être transmise sexuellement (avec ou sans préservatif), mais également par les mains et la bouche. Plus le nombre de partenaires est grand, plus le risque d'infection augmente. On comptabilise 70% de la population infectée par ce virus en France soit, soit 46.893.700 personnes contaminées (contre 150.000 personnes contaminées par le HIV).

C'est une maladie sexuellement transmissible et chaque fois qu'on me le rappelle, je me sens ou sale ou responsable ou les deux. Je suis porteuse du virus.

Je contamine des hommes qui contaminent des femmes à leur tour. Sur les 70% de la population touchée par le virus, 10% développent des lésions précancéreuse et 5% un cancer. Seuls 10% des femmes opérées ont des récidives comme moi. J'ai déjà subi deux opérations. Je me sais à nouveau porteuse du virus depuis plus d'un an et demi et je fais l'autruche, j'attends, espérant que les lésions partent d'elles mêmes.

Être malade ne me ""dérange"" pas, mais la responsabilité de la maladie des autres m'est insupportable.

Trois solutions:

Être abstinente (désolée de rompre un mythe, mais ça ne va pas être possible);

Subir une nouvelle opération pour retirer les lésions;

L'hystérectomie;

Ou... Me dire que tant que ça ne dégénère pas en cancer, je ne fais rien, égoïstement, et je continue à contaminer les autres.

Aucune de ces solutions ne me plaît. Alors je fais quoi?

Le poids de mon utérus

Parler de ma maladie c'est écouter la réaction des autres:

""Toi, tu as encore papillonné!""

Non, pardon, je suis juste une adulte célibataire de 38 ans, ni plus ni moins. (Je ne lance pas ici le débat de ""la femme, la maman et la putain"", hein...)

""Mais tu préviens tes partenaires au moins?""

Super facile et évident. Premier rendez-vous: ""Ah, au fait, il faut que je te dise, je suis atteinte d'une maladie qui est responsable du deuxième cancer féminin le plus grave; c'est sexuellement transmissible, mais ne t'inquiète pas, hein, de toute façon, tu es déjà sûrement porteur sain... Tu viens? On baise?"" J'ai parlé à deux amoureux de ma maladie: le premier m'a quittée pour cette raison; selon lui, lui dire a posteriori était un mensonge, une trahison. Soit... Le second changeait systématiquement de sujet dès que je l'évoquais. Pas très soutenant, mais au moins, il ne me regardait pas comme une pauvre petite chose comme certains le font.

""Et arrête de dire que c'est un cancer, ce n'est pas un vrai cancer!""

Vas-y, continue à frapper plus fort, ça devrait faire de la musique à un moment ou à un autre. Promis, la prochaine fois, j'attraperai une vraie maladie. Juré craché.

""Mais fais-toi retirer l'utérus, enfin! Tu as déjà deux beaux enfants!""

L'hystérectomie est de toutes, la solution la moins envisageable, parce que, oui, truc de dingue, il n'est pas impossible que je fasse encore un (des) enfant(s). Et enfin, parce que ce n'est absolument pas anodin, au niveau physique, hormonal et psychique.

Œuvre de l'artiste Olga Dupré après ma seconde opération. Je sors de mon suivi gynécologique. Mon médecin n'a pas pu effectuer le frottis tant mon col est sténosé à cause des chirurgies à répétition. Je ne supporte plus un seul examen, mon col est, je crois, traumatisé par les charcutages à répétition. J'ai mis un an à retrouver un stérilet ""à ma taille"" et la pose a été une torture sans nom.

Pourquoi, MOI, je devrais encore supporter une opération, encore souffrir, arrêter de travailler, perdre du chiffre d'affaires, peut-être ne plus supporter aucun stérilet (seul moyen de contraception qui me convienne) et devoir utiliser des préservatifs ad vitam æternam (quand chacun essaie de s'en débarrasser); alors que PERSONNE ne fait rien et qu'à la première occasion je me ferai recontaminer.

Vous faites tous partie du problème

J'en appelle à vous, vous, et vous, là, qui me lisez. Vous êtes un homme, vous faites partie du problème. Vous êtes une femme, vous êtes directement impactée. Il s'agit de nous, mais aussi de nos enfants. Il y a un pendant collectif et un pendant individuel. Nous sommes tous concernés.

J'en appelle aux chercheurs. S'il vous plaît, intéressez-vous à cette maladie. Je sais qu'un projet de vaccin spécifique pour les hommes est en cours. C'est bien. Continuez de chercher, même si notre génération est foutue, au moins nous préservons nos enfants.

J'en appelle aux pouvoirs publics: à quand une vraie campagne de communication et de sensibilisation? Il serait plus que temps d'informer la population, les médecins, que tout le monde ait accès au même degré de connaissance. Certains laboratoires ont mis au point un traitement local, qui éviterait de passer par la chirurgie. Est-ce fiable? Un traitement pour les hommes existe-t-il? Ne pourrait-on pas aussi traiter systématiquement les hommes? Pourquoi les femmes devraient-elles seules supporter le poids de cette maladie qui nous concerne tous, mais qui n'a d'incidence que sur la vie des femmes?

Follow us on Facebook and Twitter for tweets and updates throughout the day, using the hashtag #EIGEIndex The Gender Equality Index is a tool to measure the progress of gender equality in the EU, developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE).","The updated Gender Equality Index shows where Europe stands today. We are moving forward but overall progress is very slow. The EU’s score is just four points higher than ten years ago, now 66.2 out of 100. The top performing country is Sweden with a score of 82.6, while Greece moved to the bottom with 50 points. The award for the most improved country goes to Italy, which made a big leap and gained 12.9 points to place itself at rank 14 on the ladder.

‘We are moving forward at a snail’s pace. We are still a long way off from reaching a gender-equal society and all countries in the European Union have room to improve. In some areas, the gaps are even bigger than ten years ago. Our Gender Equality Index clearly shows whether government policies are matching the specific needs of women and men and whether they are working or not’ said Virginija Langbakk, Director of European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE).

‘The new results of the Gender Equality Index show that across all areas of life inequality prevails. This means Europe has a duty to act. This year I will propose further measures to help empower women and address the gender pay gap. Equality is not about making women more like men, but about creating an environment where both sexes can have equal choices and fully participate in social, work and family life’, said Věra Jourová, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality.

The biggest gains for gender equality are in decision-making

The biggest boost for gender equality over the last ten years has been in the area of decision-making, especially in the private sector. This shows that political and public pressure can work and it did well to bring change on private company boards. Although gender equality in decision-making improved by nearly 10 points over the past decade to reach 48.5, it still has the lowest score. This largely reflects the uneven representation of women and men in politics and marks a democratic deficit in EU governance.

This year, the Gender Equality Index presents a new and more comprehensive picture of power. In addition to political and economic decision-making, the results show who rules in the areas of media, research and sports. In the media landscape, there are clearly more women who study journalism (two thirds of graduates) but few make it to the top. The decision-makers in the media are mostly men (women make up 22% of board presidents of public broadcasters in the EU). In the area of research funding, women make up less than a third (27 %) of the heads of research funding organisations. The situation is even worse in the sports sector, where women hold only 14% of top positions in the sports federations across the EU.



Progress stalled – women still do most of the housework

Progress has slipped backwards in 12 countries when it comes to the time use of women and men. Only every third man engages daily in cooking and housework, compared to almost every women (79%). Men also have more time for sporting, cultural and leisure activities. Migrant women have an especially high burden when it comes to caring for family members, compared to women born in the EU (46% and 38% respectively).

Cutting across gender

For the first time, this edition of the Index shows gaps among different groups of women and men. Depending on a person’s age, education, country of birth, disability and family type their life can be completely different to the rest of the population. For example, people with a migrant background are twice at risk of poverty than women and men born in the EU. Young men are missing out on educational opportunities compared to young women and lone mothers have more difficulties to access health and dental services than couples with children.

Follow us on Facebook and Twitter for tweets and updates throughout the day, using the hashtag #EIGEIndex The Gender Equality Index is a tool to measure the progress of gender equality in the EU, developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). The Index has six core domains - work, money, knowledge, time, power and health – and two satellite domains: violence against women and intersecting inequalities. It gives more visibility to areas that need improvement and ultimately supports policy makers to design more effective gender equality measures.

Seine Online Partnervermittlung ""Secondwife"" hilft muslimischen Männern, Zweit- oder gar Dritt- und Viertfrauen zu finden und hat bereits über 100.000 Nutzer

Kritiker fordern die Abschaffung der Webseite, da sie gegen wesentliche europäische Grundrechte verstößt

Wer mehr als einen Partner heiratet, also in Polygamie lebt, macht sich in allen europäischen Ländern strafbar. In England gibt es dafür sogar bis zu sieben Jahre Haft. Das ist für den Briten Azad Chaiwala kein Hindernis.

Der 33-jährige Geschäftsmann ist Betreiber von secondwife.com, einer Webseite für muslimische Männer auf der Suche nach Zweitfrauen - wer will, kann hier auch eine dritte oder vierte finden.

Laut der britischen Zeitung ""Daily Mail"" zählt die Webseite, die in Dubai angemeldet ist, bereits 100.000 Mitglieder weltweit. Wer denkt, die Seite sei nur in arabischen Ländern ein Hit, der irrt - allein in Großbritannien gibt es 25.000 angemeldete Nutzer von Secondwife.

Und täglich kommen neue Nutzer dieses digitalen Heiratsmarktes dazu.

Der Grund für die starke Nachfrage ist klar

Der Grund für die starke Nachfrage ist für Chaiwala klar. Es gebe eine große Notwendigkeit nach seinem Service und er komme der Nachfrage nur nach.

""Die Idee zu der Webseite kam aufgrund von meinen eigenen Bedürfnissen, und ich denke, dass auch andere Menschen in meiner Situation sind"", sagte er dem britischen Nachrichtensender BBC.

Mit seiner Online-Partnervermittlung will er das Image der Polygamie ändern. Chaiwala, der selbst Polygamist ist, stellt es eins der letzten verbliebenen sozialen Tabus dar, dabei seien monogame Beziehungen als Fundament für die Ehe untauglich. Polygamie führe zu ""größeren und besseren Familien"", sagt Chaiwala.

Und prophezeit: Auch in Europa werde Polygamie bald legal sein, da man Ehen mit ""kühlem Kopf"" schließen und das ""Chaos der Gefühle"" vermeiden solle.

Bei ""Secondwife"" handelt es sich seiner Meinung nach um nichts Verbotenes. ""Altmodische und konservative Werte"" würden durch sein Projekt sogar gefördert, da mehrere Ehefrauen im Islam ausdrücklich erlaubt seien und seine Webseite sich ausdrücklich an muslimische Männer richte.

Seine Leitidee sei ein Auszug aus dem Koran: ""Dann heiratet, was euch an Frauen gut scheint, zwei, drei oder vier. Wenn ihr aber befürchtet, nicht gerecht zu handeln, dann (nur) eine ..."" - Sure 4: an-Nisa.

Die Idee hinter der arabischen Webseite verstößt aber eindeutig gegen die Gesetze in europäischen Ländern.

In Deutschland beispielsweise wird die Mehrfachehe mit einer Freiheitsstrafe von bis zu drei Jahren oder Geldstrafe geahndet. Bundesjustizminister Heiko Maas (SPD) möchte in Deutschland klare Grenzen ziehen. Die Polygamie dürfe hier keinen Platz finden: ""Deshalb dürfen in Deutschland keine Mehrfach-Ehen anerkannt werden"", kündigte er vor einem guten Jahr in der “Bild”-Zeitung an.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Mehrfach-Ehen in Deutschland: Minister Maas will schärfere Gesetze

Frauen wie ""Schmuckstücke""

Aktuell gibt es aber kaum einen Schutz gegen unregistrierte Ehen. Wer in Deutschland in einer polygamen Beziehung lebt, aber diese nirgendwo meldet, hat eine gute Chance, nie erwischt zu werden. Eine Zweitfrau könnte also auch hier vermittelt werden, nur kann sie nicht offiziell geheiratet werden.

Kritiker laufen Sturm und fordern, dass die Webseite abgestellt wird. Frauen würden wie ""Schmuckstücke"" behandelt und gesammelt werden.

Eine Twitter Nutzerin kommentierte seine Aussage, Polygamie führe zu einer ""größeren und besseren"" Familie: ""Polygamie zerstört Familien.""

What is cultural appropriation?
Cultural appropriation is defined as ""the act of taking or using things from a culture that is not your own, especially without showing that you understand or respect this culture.""
When is cultural appropriation bad?
But Black hesitates to draw a definitive line in the sand between the 'good' sort of cultural appropriation and the bad.","Cultural appropriation has been a hot topic of debate lately. Marc Jacobs sparked headlines around the world last year with his spring 2017 show which featured white models such as Gigi Hadid walking down the catwalk in fake dreadlocks.

In recent years so many people have worn Native American war bonnets and feathered headdresses to the popular Burning Man Festival, members of the Burning Man community (note: not the festival organisers, but the HYBYCOZO art crew who regularly contribute artworks to the event) wrote an opinion piece begging festival goers to 'listen up before dressing up'.

In May, Chanel came under fire for selling a boomerang 'accessory' for close to $2000; while Katy Perry was accused of appropriating Japanese culture due to her geisha-inspired performance at the American Music Awards.

While the media interest in the topic has some people throwing their arms up in the air and lamenting, 'am I not allowed to do anything anymore?', others would argue that it's a vital conversation well worth having, and having often. Particularly when incidents of blackface are still taking place, and let's all agree on one thing: blackface is not okay.

So ahead of Halloween, where dressing up in costume is pretty much mandatory (yes, yes, we know it's not an Australian tradition, but you can't sweep it under the rug completely) we thought we'd go back to the basics of cultural appropriation: what it is, how to strike a balance and the things you should definitely, definitely not dress up as next Tuesday.

What is cultural appropriation?

Cultural appropriation is defined as ""the act of taking or using things from a culture that is not your own, especially without showing that you understand or respect this culture.""

While this sounds simple enough, in our digital, globalised society the lines between something that's obviously offensive (blackface) and something that might be considered as embracing another culture (exotic cuisine) can be blurry.

""When I try to think about how to define it, the way I've come to now think of it is not necessarily so much about cross cultural engagement as it is an indication of a strong split that's going on,"" Dr Shameem Black from the department of gender, media and cultural studies at ANU College of Asia and the Pacific told HuffPost Australia.

""To me, the real split is between how enthusiastically a cultural product or process from a part of the world is received and how enthusiastically the people from that region are received.""

Katy Perry performs ""Unconditionally"" at the 41st American Music Awards.

When is cultural appropriation bad? Or not?

It's important to note that it's often perfectly okay to take on aspects of another culture. In fact, there are many benefits.

""I think the benefits are obvious. It can encourage creativity, for instance. There are lots examples in the history of art whereby people borrow from other cultures in a very creative way,"" associate professor at La Trobe University and author of 'Taking Responsibility for the Past', Janna Thompson, told HuffPost Australia.

""For example, Picasso did a lot of borrowing from African art, and Monet and many other artists were inspired by Chinese and Japanese art.

""Another benefit could be a kind of fostering of communication between cultures, especially if it's not all one way. People learning about the preconceptions and ways of thinking of a different culture through their art or other things that are appropriate.

""There are obviously benefits of appropriation and of course it can lead to people in countries, particularly third world countries, becoming known for what they do and appreciated for what they do.

""I think the word appropriation is loaded. It suggests exploitation or taking something away from somebody. I think of appropriation in a sense of making use of ideas and others is quite valuable. I think what's important is, first of all, consent.""

When you look at the Native American headdress, we are talking about a group that has been dispossessed and dis-empowered, with many, many killed -- we're talking really serious histories of violence. Dr Shameem Black

Now this is where we delve into the balancing act between cultural appreciation and causing cultural offence.

""In general I think there is nothing wrong with cultures borrowing ideas [and] artistic styles from each other,"" Thompson told HuffPost Australia. ""But there are two factors which can make this appropriation a 'rip off'.

""One is the commercial advantages that can be reaped by Westerners by 'borrowing' from traditional cultures or disadvantaged groups. The other is that traditional cultures often do not have the same ideas as Westerners about the role of cultural artefacts.""

Take the Native American headdress, for example. Are many Native American communities benefiting from its worldwide commercial use? Probably not. And are the Native Americans thrilled about Americans (or others) pairing their traditional war bonnets with a silver bikini and fur boots for the ultimate Burning Man outfit? If you're unsure of the answer, listen to what Black has to say.

""When you look at the Native American headdress, we are talking about a group that has been dispossessed and disempowered, with many, many killed -- we're talking really serious histories of violence.

The best experience of my life! #burningman #burningman2017 #burnergirls A post shared by Carol Chafauzer (@carolchafauzer) on Sep 1, 2017 at 1:47pm PDT

""So something as small as being able to make economic returns off this kind of interest... I can see how that becomes a real source of concern. That's not to say economic returns solve everything. I think some people would say, even if Native Americans were making money off it, it would still be problematic because of the histories of violence.""

So, yeah. You might want to rethink the war bonnet as being this season's hottest festival accessory.

Black also makes the point that while some aspects of a culture are 'embraced' in Western society, the people from whom that practice or item comes from are not.

""I think where the energy behind cultural appropriation comes from is when people feel they've migrated from a part of the world -- so for example India, where my mother is from -- and people will often come and say, 'Oh today a cultural process like yoga is very popular in Australia and the U.S. That's wonderful.' But by the same token, many people who came from the Indian subcontinent are subject in 'other-ing' in these countries,"" Black told HuffPost Australia.

""I think there's a real question around 'Why is yoga more welcome than I am?' I think there's a lot of frustration around that.

""I want to make it clear I'm just speaking metaphorically [and using yoga] as a kind of rhetorical device, but it is true that a lot of these practices have become more commercially viable or moved into different economies than they once were in.""

A model with fake dreadlocks walks down the catwalk at Marc Jacobs' controversial 2017 Spring show.

How can I appreciate a culture without appropriating it?

This is a good question, especially because many people aren't trying to cause offence, aren't profiting from anything and simply want to admire a culture that isn't theirs.

""I don't necessarily think there are wrong ways or right ways. Perhaps the most productive way to go about it is asking questions about when we are drawn to a culture or practice that isn't something we are automatically connected to,"" Black suggested.

""I think we can certainly use these opportunities to learn about histories and reflect on our own. How did we get to this point? That kind of self searching is really positive on an individual level and societal level.""

But Black hesitates to draw a definitive line in the sand between the 'good' sort of cultural appropriation and the bad.

I will say I think it would be terrible if we only thought we are allowed to hold things close to us that are from our own culture. Dr Shameem Black

""I'm not sure there ever are lines,"" she said. ""Or if there are lines, they are mobile and they will change as our conversations in society will change.

""I will say I think it would be terrible if we only thought we are allowed to hold things close to us that are from our own culture.""

Thompson is more concrete.

""I don't think anyone should expropriate things without asking the people who created them for their consent,"" she said. ""If they don't give their consent, you should try to communicate with them about what can be taken or used. And they should always get a proper return, if commercialisation is involved. As much as possible there should be a two-way equal exchange.""

Not cool.

But what if you're just a Jane Doe, with no commercial interest?

""I think people should understand at least where these things come from,"" Thompson said. ""For instance, most people would know it's wrong to blacken their faces because of the history, it's an insulting thing to do. People need to be aware of the history of these things and ensure they're not just insulting others.""

And while you might be a small fry in the scheme of things, it doesn't mean you can absolve responsibility completely.

Does the culture you're interested in have a history of violence and/or oppression? Would an indigenous culture have benefit from the commercialisation of this particular product? Are you able to simply remove something when you get bored of it (for example, black face paint or a fake tribal tattoo) when others can't?

Which, finally, brings us to...

Halloween costumes (and all other forms of dress up)

We get it. Dressing up is fun, and pretty much the whole point of it is to be able to pretend you're something different to yourself. (Unless you're Kit Harington who went to a costume party as his own character Jon Snow, but that's another story for another time).

But can we please remind people of the literal MILLIONS of costumes you can dress up in that aren't offensive to others?

""When it comes to costumes, the problematic area seems to be people dressing up in costume form someone else's traditional culture,"" Jeffrey Browitt, associate professor in Latin American studies at the University of Technology Sydney told HuffPost Australia.

""And often people who dress up in costumes like that are not setting out to be insulting. But it can be insulting to the people whose culture they are mimicking.

""When you dress up as an American Indian on Halloween or do blackface or put on a hijab or something like that, that's when it becomes a question of cultural appropriation. Because often we are talking about people who are or have been an oppressed minority. If you are in the U.S. and are dressing up as a Native American, I would say that's highly offensive because of the power differentials.""

Better.

You might say people are being overly sensitive, but as both Browitt and Black point out, it's a sensitive and uncertain time.

""In some ways we are seeing the failures of the promise of globalisation. It was meant to provide this easy wonderful borderless world, but the realities are much more complicated,"" Black said.

""There are very complex and often disturbing experiences people have had in the last few decades, and this question has now started to have an intensity [that wasn't there] when people were more optimistic where the future might go.""

So. Costumes. Here's the lowdown.

""The best rule of thumb is to play it safe, dress up as a witch or a goblin and leave the ethnic costumes to one side,"" Browitt said. ""No Indian headdress, no ethnic dress from cultures that don't belong to you in any way, and which, by the way, have nothing to do with Halloween. Halloween is a pagan Celtic tradition, so if nothing else [ethnic dress] would be inappropriate for the occasion, anyway.""",What Exactly Is Cultural Appropriation?

The Taj Mahal has been at the centre of controversy over the last few weeks. And even as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visits the most famous historic monument in the country, reports suggest that there are no takers for the monument under the government's 'Adopt A Heritage' project.

The Times of India reports that while Qutub Minar, Jantar Mantar, Purana Qila, Safdarjung's Tomb and Agrasen ki Baoli in Delhi, Odisha's Sun Temple, the Ajanta Ellora caves have found private players who would maintain the monuments, the Taj Mahal is still waiting for adoption.

The Adopt A Heritage project started by the government assigns the responsibility of heritage sites and monuments ""to private sector companies, public sector companies and individuals for the development of tourist amenities. They would become 'Monument Mitras' and adopt the sites. The basic and advanced amenities of the tourist destinations would be provided by them. They would also look after the operations and the maintenance of the amenities"".

Tourism secretary Rashmi Verma told the Times of India that the Taj Mahal would still be up for adoption in case a private entity wanted to take it up for adoption.

Meanwhile, Adityanath has already reached Agra was his much publicised visit to the heritage structure.

IANS reported that a cleanliness drive has already been launched at the monument for Adityanath's visit.

Indian Express, meanwhile, reported that the CM will lay foundation stone for a tourist pathway from Taj Mahal to Agra Fort.

His visit comes close on the heels of controversy after controversy regarding the monument. First, the Taj Mahal, which is arguably one of the most visited tourist spots in India, was left out of the Uttar Pradesh government's official tourism booklet. It was later added to it.

This gaff was followed by BJP leader Sangeet Som's highly controversial opinions of the Taj Mahal, where he said it was a blot on the Indian culture because it was built by 'traitors'.

NEW YORK — Two New York City police detectives are accused of threatening an 18-year-old woman with arrest over a bottle of prescription pills, handcuffing her, driving her around and then raping her.

Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez says the detectives, Eddie Martins and Richard Hall, were arraigned Monday on a 50-count indictment that includes kidnapping and rape counts.

The woman says the detectives assaulted her on Sept. 15 in their van while they were on duty. The prosecutor says DNA recovered from the woman matched both defendants.

Nach seiner Absetzung und einer Anklage wegen Rebellion ist der katalanische Regionalpräsident Carles Puigdemont nach Belgien gereist. Der Anführer der Unabhängigkeitsbewegung habe dort am Montag mit einem Anwalt gesprochen, berichtete die belgische Nachrichtenagentur Belga am Abend unter Berufung auf den Juristen.

Unklar blieb zunächst, ob der Katalane in Belgien Asyl beantragen will.

Der Chefkoordinator der Volkspartei (PP) des spanischen Ministerpräsidenten Mariano Rajoy, Fernando Martínez Maíllo, kommentierte die Medienberichte mit den Worten: ""Ja, das ist anscheinend bestätigt."" Die Flucht zeuge ""von Verzweiflung"", sagte er am Montag vor Journalisten in Madrid.

Anklage wegen Rebellion

Die spanische Staatsanwaltschaft hatte am Montag Anklage gegen Puigdemont und weitere Angehörige der abgesetzten Regionalregierung erhoben. Die Vorwürfe gegen die Angeklagten lauteten unter anderem auf Rebellion, Auflehnung gegen die Staatsgewalt und Unterschlagung öffentlicher Gelder, sagte Generalstaatsanwalt José Manuel Maza am Montag in Madrid.

Am Wochenende hatte Belgiens Staatssekretär für Asyl und Migration, Theo Francken, für Empörung gesorgt, weil er sein Land als möglichen Zufluchtsort für die abgesetzten Politiker ins Spiel brachte. Katalanen, die sich politisch verfolgt fühlten, könnten in Belgien um Asyl ansuchen, sagte der Flame dem flämischen Sender VTM News.

Der belgische Premierminister Charles Michel wies ihn laut Nachrichtenagentur Belga zurück: ""Ich bitte Theo Francken, kein Öl ins Feuer zu gießen.""

Hätte ein Asylantrag Puigdemonts Erfolg?

Ob ein Asylantrag Puigdemonts in Belgien Chancen hätte, gilt als sehr fraglich. Über den EU-Vertrag ist geregelt, dass sich die Mitgliedstaaten im Zusammenhang mit Asylangelegenheiten untereinander als sogenannte sichere Herkunftsländer betrachten - das heißt, es wird grundsätzlich davon ausgegangen, dass es in EU-Staaten keine Verfolgungsgefahr gibt.

Deshalb wurde festgelegt, dass der Asylantrag eines Staatsangehörigen eines Mitgliedstaats von einem anderen Mitgliedstaat nur unter ganz besondereren Bedingungen berücksichtigt werden darf.

Möglich wäre die Berücksichtigung des Asylantrages demnach nur dann, wenn Spanien unter Berufung auf einen Notstand die Verpflichtungen der Konvention zum Schutz der Menschenrechte und Grundfreiheiten aussetzen würde - oder wenn gegen das Land ein EU-Verfahren wegen des Verdachts auf schwerwiegende Verstöße gegen die Rechtsstaatlichkeit laufen würde.

Da beides nicht der Fall ist, müsste Belgien auf jeden Fall den Rat der EU-Mitgliedstaaten einschalten. Dieser dürfte wenig begeistert sein, wenn Belgien der spanischen Zentralregierung mit Asyl für Puigdemont in den Rücken fallen würde.

Bislang stehen die EU-Partner geschlossen hinter der Zentralregierung in Madrid, unter ihnen auch der belgische Premierminister Charles Michel, der nicht der flämischen Partei N-VA abgehört.

Je me disais que cela mettrait les femmes et les hommes dans deux camps différents, celui des victimes contre les agresseurs, au lieu de lutter ensemble contre ces comportements ignobles.

Je me disais aussi que ce mouvement serait récupéré et instrumentalisé par des personnalités politiques, lesquels d'habitude n'en avaient que faire lorsque nous tentions de les mobiliser sur le sujet.

Je me disais encore que ce n'était pas au peuple de juger, mais aux juges d'un tribunal. Et qu'un hashtag ne pourrait pas remplacer le dépôt de plainte nécessaire pour que tous ces salauds soient enfin condamnés pour leurs actes. Et que la Démocratie, cette chère République en pâtirait, dévoilant ainsi ses faiblesses.

Et puis toute cette communication virtuelle réduisant la souffrance des femmes à trois mots précédés d'un hashtag ne correspondait pas à ma génération préférant le contenu, l'explication, le raisonnement, et le débat.

J'étais donc bien assise sur mes positions lorsque certains commentaires ont commencé à apparaître sur les réseaux sociaux.

J'ai entendu tout d'abord les interventions d'Eric Zemmour, d'Elisabeth Levy et d'Alain Finkielkraut et là aussi je me sentais en total désaccord, trouvant que l'intellectualisation de ce débat coupée de toute émotion vécue dans la chair n'avait rien à faire là non plus. Que leur posture allait blesser de nombreuses femmes qui avaient profité de ce grand déballage pour oser enfin parler.

Et puis, cette petite curée commençait à dévoiler le véritable visage de certains hommes, des amis éloignés, mais des hommes que j'estimais. Ils s'en donnaient à cœur joie avec leurs petits commentaires salaces. Ils écrivaient ""avoir mis des mains au cul à certaines femmes et qu'elles avaient aimé ça"". Ou encore que ""toutes ces bonnes femmes qui se mettaient des robes sexy l'avaient bien cherché"". D'autres connaissances disaient qu'ils voyaient dans l'affaire Wekstein, un complot antisémite.

Evidemment il y aurait toujours des antisémites pour profiter de cette affaire pour cracher leur venin. Mais Weinstein n'était pas tombé parce qu'il était juif mais parce que ses actes étaient condamnables.

Et qu'il ne pouvait pas y avoir d'amalgame dans un esprit sain. Les viols et les agressions sexuelles étant largement commis par un large panel d'hommes, de toutes confessions, de toutes origines, de tous âges, et de tous milieux sociaux.

Et puis durant ces derniers jours, j'ai vu aussi les langues de femmes qui m'entouraient se délier et oser enfin parler de ce qu'elles avaient subi. Il y avait des témoignages de très jeunes-filles qui racontaient leur première agression à l'âge de 10 ans. Puis il y avait de très vieilles dames qui se décidaient enfin à en parler. Elles avaient été agressées parfois plus d'une fois dans leurs vies. Sur leur lieu de travail, par des amis de leurs parents, par un jeune homme qu'elle venait de rencontrer, dans le métro, dans la rue, dans une cave de cité comme dans un appartement du 16e arrondissement... Il n'y avait aucune règle.

Nous étions presque toutes passées par là comme un passage obligé dans notre vie de femme, un droit de cuissage qui finalement n'aurait jamais cessé d'exister. Un atroce héritage transmis de mère en fille.

Et ce, malgré des décennies de luttes féministes acharnées.

Ce combat était trans-générationnel. Mariée de force, ma grand-mère s'était battue pour divorcer et épouser l'homme qu'elle aimait. Et moi, je m'étais battue pour que d'autres femmes ne subissent pas ce que j'avais subi. Et à son tour, ma fille avait été harcelée.

Alors en réalisant tout cela, je me suis levée ce matin en me disant que ce hashtag lancé était finalement une main tendue vers toutes ces femmes qui se taisent, un outil certes insipide, mais qui avait eu le mérite de déverrouiller les bouches et les consciences mettant la pression sur tous ces hommes qui usent de leur pouvoir et de leur force pour nous agresser.

Il avait eu aussi le mérite de me permettre d'oser dire que comme toutes ces femmes, que moi aussi j'ai été agressée en faisant mon travail de journaliste, dans une période de ma vie où mon ventre de femme abritait une nouvelle vie. J'étais enceinte de 7 mois et demi lorsque cet homme m'a agressée.

Ma colère est intacte. Je ne dirai jamais son nom, c'est trop tard. Et puis, j'ai su me défendre et mon fils est venu au monde malgré cette agression. Et c'est tout ce qui compte aujourd'hui. De toute façon, le mal est fait et la prescription dépassée. Mais je n'oublie pas...

Et je voulais comme toutes ces femmes qui ont eu ce courage que je n'ai pas su trouver en moi avant, le dire, l'écrire afin de lui dire que je n'avais désormais plus peur de lui. Alors peu importe la façon de faire, qu'il s'agisse de vengeance ou de courage, de dénonciation ou de délation, ce qui est important aujourd'hui, c'est de dépasser nos divergences et de nous battre ensemble, hommes et femmes réunis, afin de protéger les futures générations de femmes.

L'héritage du pire, transmis de mères en filles doit prendre fin.

Ricardo Ramos, executive director of PREPA, said at a press conference he would honor Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s Sunday morning request to terminate the business deal, which has raised questions from several lawmakers and government agencies.

“I want to clarify, so it’s very clear, that the cancellation of this contract does not respond to an acceptance that there was something outside of the law or out of line with [PREPA’s] procedures of emergency contracts,” Ramos said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday that it had “significant concerns” over PREPA’s decision to award Whitefish the contract earlier this month and would be conducting a review.

Whitefish, a two-year-old firm based in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s Montana hometown and financially backed in part by a major donor to President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, had just two full-time employees when Hurricane Maria hit the island more than a month ago.

Language in the contract ― a full copy is here ― appeared to give Whitefish a sweetheart deal as the people of Puerto Rico struggle to recover from the devastation of the hurricane.

The contract stated that, “In no event shall [government bodies] have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements.” That gave Whitefish wide discretion and privacy over how it used $300 million in U.S. taxpayer money.

It also waived “any claim against Contractor related to delayed completion of the work,” which means the government couldn’t do much if Whitefish dragged out its job restoring electricity to the 3.4 million Americans living on the island.

Alvin Baez / Reuters Employees of Montana-based Whitefish Energy Holdings were at work last week in Puerto Rico.

Ramos said Sunday that $300 million was the maximum amount of money Whitefish could have been paid for its completed services and denied that PREPA had already committed to paying the full amount.

So far, PREPA has paid or been billed for over $20 million by Whitefish, according to Ramos. He said there wouldn’t be a penalty for canceling the contract, but that PREPA would have to pay for Whitefish to remove their equipment from the island as well as whatever work they complete by mid-November, which he expected to total at least an additional $10.9 million.

The contract’s cancellation, which won’t go into effect for 30 days per the contract’s terms, isn’t expected to stop any work the company currently has in progress. But it could delay other grid restoration efforts by 10 to 12 weeks, Ramos said.

“The controversy that the contract has generated is truly immense,” said Ramos, adding that he had been summoned by Congress to answer questions. “It’s a huge distraction. So as I understand it, it’s the better of two evils to cancel the contract.”

Whitefish said it would finish any work that PREPA asks them to complete before leaving the U.S. territory, according to a statement the company emailed to HuffPost on Sunday.

“We are very disappointed in the decision by Governor Rosselló to ask PREPA to cancel the contract which led to PREPA’s announcement this afternoon,” reads the statement. “We only wish the best for the great people of Puerto Rico. We are very proud of our contributions to the island’s recovery and proud of the tremendous work that our team has done under very challenging conditions.

It’s been more than a month since the hurricane destroyed Puerto Rico’s infrastructure and nearly 70 percent of people still have no power ― a particularly precarious situation for hospitals that have been relying on temporary generators to keep people alive.

HuffPost reached out to experts in government contracting to see if this was as bad a deal for Puerto Rico as it sounded. The answer was a resounding yes.

“Outrageous,” said Charles Tiefer, a professor of government contracting at the University of Baltimore law school.

“The clause that shields the contractor from audit or review is a red flag of overcharging,” said Tiefer. “The contractor works for PREPA, not the other way around. I can’t imagine how any responsible government official could put such an anti-audit clause into a government contract.”

Anthony Varona, a professor and vice dean at American University’s Washington College of Law and an expert in contracts law, said it was “entirely inappropriate” for a private contractor to prevent the government from auditing how taxpayer money was spent.

“The prohibition as written in this agreement is a blatant attempt to blindfold and tie the hands of the government officials responsible for overseeing the contract’s performance,” said Varona. “It strikes me as an open invitation for fraud and abuse.”

There were other concerning details in the contract, like the high rates Whitefish was charging for labor. The company was paying $240 an hour for a general foreman and $227 for a lineman. For some context, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said first-line supervisors of construction sites make about $43 an hour and construction laborers make about $23 an hour.

Whitefish was also paying for expensive food and lodging for its employees. The contract stated that each person could spend nearly $80 a day for meals and $332 a day for lodging. Flights for employees were being billed at $1,000 each way.

Neither PREPA nor Whitefish responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment on the contents of the contract.

Mario Tama via Getty Images A man clears destroyed tree branches in a neighborhood in San Isidro, Puerto Rico, that's been without grid electricity for weeks. Eighty percent of the island hasn't had power for more than a month.

Ramos emphasized that it was “tabloid” reports ― not any wrongdoing on the part of the company ― that prompted Rosselló’s request to cancel the contract on Sunday.

“Certainly, if the situation that is going on in the U.S. with the media was not happening ... there [would be] no need for the cancellation of the contract,” Ramos said. “We’re managing risks. There is a perception risk, a reputational risk, and a delay risk in continuing with the contract.”

Steve Schooner, a former high-ranking government contracting official who is now a law professor at George Washington University, said the Whitefish contract has given him great material for his classes because there are so many problems with it.

“The contract ― both the process and the content ― rivals, and in some ways exceeds, some of the best final exams I’ve written for my students over the last two decades,” he said.

Not everyone said the contract was stunningly out of the ordinary. Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project On Government Oversight, wrote a blog post about why he thinks the contract raised concerns but was mostly normal, given bigger problems surrounding many federal contracts.

Still, Amey told HuffPost that it’s “odd” that the contract gave Whitefish the ability to delay its work without any accountability. He said that clause allowed the company to potentially prolong its work so it got paid the entire $300 million ― and then push to extend the contract for even more money.

“Damage provisions often are included to incentivize the work’s completion,” he said. “Waiving claims could jeopardize the completion of the work in the agreed on one-year term.”

As fishy as it has looked that a tiny company in the Montana hometown of the U.S. interior secretary landed such a big contract, Zinke has insisted he had nothing to do with it.

Tiefer said while all the facts aren’t out yet, it’s clear that something “went very wrong” with the way the contract was awarded.

“Let’s put it this way,” he said. “Whitefish didn’t make the shortlist because of a world-class reputation.”

Across the Philippines, thousands of people live with the dead.
Most families earn a small wage -- around $2 per week, per grave -- cleaning and looking after the graves they live on.
We cannot do anything about that,"" Christina Tuason, an employee of the cemetery, tells me from her office that sits above the crematorium.
They live in the big trees... if you are weak, you will be possessed"".","Rey and Ralph have been digging this grave for two days. Their job is made harder by the monsoonal downpour overnight -- mud and rubbish has washed back into the grave. But they can't stop work. Someone is being buried in just a couple of hours.

""Who is this?""

""She's a girl.""

""Put it in the sack.""

The grave they're digging isn't a new plot. They're evicting the body of a young girl, whose family can't afford to pay for the grave any more. With bare hands, they lift up her skull and place it carefully in a bag. Rey grabs the neck of her shirt, revealing the bones of her torso.

Graves like this typically have a five year lease. When that time is up, the bones are removed, placed in a sack and the families are called to collect them. Many don't. Dozens of old bags are strewn across the cemeteries. Skulls and bones are left out in the baking sun.

Grave digging is a common job for men at Pasay City Cemetery -- a crowded public cemetery in the heart of the Filipino capital, Manila. Women nearby are hanging washing from trees, while young children play games and laugh beside the grave. For workers like Rey and Ralph, this isn't just a workplace, it's also a home. Around 300 families call this cemetery home, making a living among cement crypts and mausoleums.

I'm here with 'Dateline' to get an insight into the lives of these people and ask why are they living in cemeteries? Across the Philippines, thousands of people live with the dead. For many of the poor, it's a choice between life in the overcrowded slums and life in the cemetery.

When I arrive at Pasay Cemetery, dozens of young kids come running out. They guide me inside a place that for them is more like a playground than a place for the dead. Narrow dirt alleyways are full of life: a middle-aged man is carefully chiseling a marble headstone; two women have set up a stall selling grilled meat; young boys are playing basketball while a young woman is having a lunch-time nap on top of a mausoleum.

The young boys nick-name me 'Spiderman' -- a name they shout from the rooftops of tombs. They test out their English with me and imitate my Australian accent.

One of those boys is 10-year-old Eijee. He moved to this cemetery five years ago with his parents and two sisters from a small rural province outside of Manila. His youngest sister, Alexandra, was born in the cemetery. His family hoped that a city life would bring more work opportunities -- but with no money for a home they made a life here at Pasay.

Eijee leads me to his home, where his mother is cooking rice on a small campfire. He shows me inside the small living room and an upper level where the entire family sleeps side by side. On the walls, made out of scrap metals and wood, are Eijee's drawings of manga characters. They're the same cartoon characters I watched when I was a kid.

I ask him what he thinks about living here.

""Jumping from one place to another,"" he says. ""There are no enemies and I have many play mates here.""

But quickly, his smile disappears.

""Now, we're going back to the province, my mum told me. I'll be sad [to leave here],"" he says, looking across at his mum, Joan Abellar.

Most families earn a small wage -- around $2 per week, per grave -- cleaning and looking after the graves they live on. Joan's husband sells soft drinks along the streets that surround the cemetery, but it isn't enough money to survive.

""In a day, sometimes we only eat once. That's why life is really difficult,"" she tells me. She has decided to move the family back to the province, to try and make a living on a family farm and make sure the kids study.

It's a decision that will make the administrators of Pasay City Cemetery happy.

""We can't stop 300 families who steal electricity and water from us. We cannot do anything about that,"" Christina Tuason, an employee of the cemetery, tells me from her office that sits above the crematorium.

""The truth is we don't like them living here. Not because we don't like them, but because it's not fair. The ones staying here should be the dead ones, not the living.""

To make a life here you need to be resourceful. Residents tap electricity into their home illegally -- wires twist up from their home and connect to nearby meters. Water is collected from a nearby well. Many of the residents say they've been kicked out of the cemetery by the local government but, as one resident tells me, ""like rats"", they find a way back in.

As the sun begins to set, many of the children run home before it gets dark. Most of the homes don't have lights at night. At the entrance to the cemetery, some adults are celebrating a birthday on top of a tomb, drinking beers and laughing. Beside them is a row of gambling machines. The man behind them asks us not to film them -- gambling in public spaces isn't legal.

We hear about a family home that's notorious for a favourite Filipino past-time. Making our way through the dark pathways is a little unsettling, but when we finally reach Daniel Pangilinan's home, we are welcomed inside a massive living area. His wife and three grandchildren are watching TV, using a tomb as a couch.

Daniel is an elder of the cemetery -- he's lived here for 55 years. As a 12 year old, he found a way to make a living digging graves and carving tombstones. He tells me he knew the people that are buried inside his home. He buried them himself.

I can't help but ask him if he feels like his home is haunted.

His face lights up, telling me endless stories about ""lost spirits just hovering around. They live in the big trees... if you are weak, you will be possessed"". It's something that fascinates him, rather than spooks him.

But Daniel's home isn't just filled with spirits; it's also full of unexpected stories of life. He lives with his daughter, Carmela, who is seven months pregnant with her third child. He tells me about delivering her second child himself, right on top of a tomb.

""I was the one who delivered her before she was brought to the hospital. I already cut the umbilical cord. I dressed her up"".

Before we leave, Daniel shows me just what makes his home famous in this area. He plugs a microphone into the TV; connecting to two large speakers he bought from a local scrap market. He switches on a karaoke song that made him win countless local competitions -- Tom Jones' 'I Know'.

As his surprisingly smooth voice echoes around the cemetery, I think about how different life here is to how I imagined. I thought life among the dead would be macabre and sad, but the people here have built a warm, welcoming community.

Daniel wouldn't have it any other way. He says one day he will be buried in this cemetery and knows that many other families will keep his grave company.

They are appearing for the alleged murder of their three-year-old daughter, Poppie van der Merwe. On top of murder, they are also facing two charges of assault with intent to seriously injure, and child abuse of not only Poppie, but also her brother and stepsister.

The alleged incidents took place between September 2015 and October 2016 in various places.

The couple was arrested after their daughter, Poppie, died near Mamogaleskraal outside Brits, in October last year.

Kobus, the stepfather, was arrested first, followed by 45-year-old Louisa.

An application was made for the charges against the Koekemoer couple to be centralised, as the various alleged incidents on the charge sheet had taken place in Brits, Orania, and Hopetown – all with their own court jurisdictions.

It was previously reported that according to the charge sheet, social workers considered removing the children from the accused's care after monitoring and assessing the children's surroundings. Louisa and Kobus then fled Orania with Poppie and her brother in September 2016, moving to Brits in October.

Poppie was allegedly seriously assaulted on October 25 last year, and died of injuries allegedly resulting from a beating, upon arrival at the hospital.

Kobus was arrested at the hospital after hospital staff alerted authorities. Louisa was subsequently arrested when she could not explain herself to the investigating officer and had different versions of the truth.

""The deceased's body was riddled with bruises and marks. The cause of death: head injuries as a result of assault with a blunt instrument,"" the investigating officer told the court.

Later, when Louisa made a statement as a State witness against her husband, she said Poppie's stepfather hit Poppie's head against a cupboard the day before her death, adding also that her husband had kicked Poppie in the stomach.

Getötet wurde er ausgerechnet - oder: gerechterweise - durch Sansa Stark, eigentlich Ramsays Ehefrau, die er so lange drangsaliert und missbraucht hatte. Nicht nur Sansa, sondern auch alle Zuschauer und ich haben gelächelt, als Ramsay endlich sein verdientes Ende fand. Darf man das?

¿Quién es Paul Manafort?

Paul Manafort se entregó este lunes al FBI para enfrentar los primeros cargos producidos por una investigación especial, sobre la presunta injerencia rusa en las elecciones presidenciales de Estados Unidos de 2016.

Él es un hombre de negocios y agente del Partido Republicano desde hace mucho tiempo: trabajó como cabildero de Washington y asesor político internacional. Sus antiguos clientes incluyen líderes autoritarios como el difunto Ferdinand Marcos de Filipinas y empresarios y políticos rusos y ucranianos.

Pero su ocupación más conocida sea quizás que fue gerente de campaña de la campaña de Donald Trump en el verano de 2016.

Él, junto con su asociado Rick Gates, fueron acusados ​​por un gran jurado federal con 12 cargos que incluye: conspiración contra Estados Unidos, conspiración para lavar dinero, ser un agente no registrado de un principal extranjero, hacer declaraciones falsas y engañosas y siete cargos de no presentación de informes de bancos extranjeros y cuentas financieras.

¿Quién es Rick Gates?

Rick Gates era el adjunto y socio comercial de Manafort. Según dos antiguos empleados de alto nivel de Trump, él funcionó esencialmente como el gerente de campaña de Trump por más de dos meses... sin cobrar un sueldo.

The New York Times informó en junio, que se había ordenado al equipo de transición de Trump que conservara los materiales relacionados con las investigaciones en curso sobre la supuesta intromisión rusa en las elecciones de 2016. Según el Times, el memorando de la oficina del asesor especial para el ex equipo de transición también buscó información específica sobre cinco personas, incluidas Manafort y Gates.

Según la acusación, entre al menos 2006 y 2015, Manafort y Gates actuaron como agentes no registrados del gobierno ucraniano, un partido político ucraniano encabezado por el entonces presidente de Ucrania, Victor Yanukovich, y el propio Yanukovich. La acusación dice que ambos generaron decenas de millones de dólares en ingresos como resultado de su trabajo en Ucrania.

Yanukovich ha estado viviendo en el exilio en Rusia desde que fue derrocado por las protestas callejeras masivas en Kiev en 2014. Su partida encendió la mecha para la anexión de Crimea en Moscú y un levantamiento separatista en el este de Ucrania, principalmente de habla rusa.

La acusación dice que Gates ayudó a Manafort a obtener dinero de cuentas en el extranjero y que Gates utilizó ese dinero para pagar gastos personales, incluidos ""su hipoteca, la matrícula de los hijos y la decoración de interiores de su residencia en Virginia"".

¿De qué se les acusa?

La acusación contra Manafort y Gates dice que ambos generaron decenas de millones de dólares en ingresos del trabajo de Ucrania y lavaron dinero a través de decenas de entidades estadounidenses y extranjeras para ocultar los pagos a las autoridades estadounidenses entre 2006 y al menos hasta 2016.

En junio, Manafort y Gates se registraron retroactivamente en el Departamento de Justicia como agentes extranjeros, en una presentación de la Ley de Registro de Agentes Extranjeros que demostró que ganaron 17.1 millones de dólares por cabildear en nombre del Partido de las Regiones (un partido político pro Rusia en Ucrania), entre 2012 y 2014

La acusación dice que ocultaron a Estados Unidos su trabajo y sus ingresos como agentes de los partidos políticos ucranianos. Y que usaron su riqueza para llevar un ""estilo de vida lujoso"" sin pagar impuestos sobre los ingresos.

La acusación dice que más de $ 75 millones fluyeron a través de las cuentas en el extranjero de Manafort y Gates. Manafort, según la acusación, blanqueó más de $ 18 millones.

La acusación también alega que Manafort y Gates, junto con otros, conspiraron para defraudar a Estados Unidos ""obstaculizando, perjudicando, obstruyendo y derrotando las legítimas funciones gubernamentales"" del Departamento de Justicia y el Departamento del Tesoro entre 2006 y 2017.

Manafort fue acusado de nueve cargos y Gates fue acusado de ocho.

¿Cuáles son los vínculos de Manafort con Trump?

Manafort se unió a la campaña presidencial de Trump en marzo de 2016 y más tarde se convirtió en gerente de campaña, pero se vio obligado a renunciar en agosto cuando surgieron preguntas sobre su trabajo anterior para el partido político del ex presidente ucraniano Viktor Yanukovich, respaldado por el Kremlin.

Business Insider informó que Manafort y Trump se han conectado desde la década de 1980, cuando Trump contrató a la firma de cabildeo de Manafort para ayudar a la Organización Trump.

En 2006, Manafort y su esposa compraron un apartamento en la Torre Trump en la ciudad de Nueva York, que Manafort aún posee y donde vive cuando se encuentra en Manhattan.

¿Cómo se relacionan los cargos con Trump?

""No tiene nada que ver con la campaña o las acusaciones de colusión con Rusia"", dijo el abogado de Washington John Dowd, quien representa a Trump en la investigación sobre Rusia.

Un confidente de Trump dijo: rn lo que se refiere al presidente, esto no es nada. Todos los 12 cargos de la acusación que se presentaron hoy, todos son anteriores a su mandato en la campaña.

La acusación del abogado especial dice que Manafort y Gates lavaron el dinero a través de decenas de corporaciones, sociedades y cuentas bancarias de Estados Unidos y extranjeras desde aproximadamente 2006 hasta ""al menos 2016"".

¿Qué tan significativo es el arresto de Rick Gates?

La acusación establece el grado de participación de Gates con Manafort desde hace años. Esto podría potencialmente abrir la puerta para que Gates testifique contra Manafort y otros en el futuro. David Sklansky, profesor de la Facultad de Derecho de Stanford y ex fiscal federal, dijo que Gates podría sentir la presión de cooperar y dar testimonio contra Trump.

¿Y George Papadopoulos?

George Papadopoulos fue uno de los asesores de la campaña electoral de Donald Trump y tenía como tareas toda la política exterior de la campaña.

Se dice que se reunió con funcionarios rusos en Londres en marzo del 2016, para obtener datos ""sucios"" sobre Hillary Clinton, además de que se encontró con una mujer, que se dice podría ser sobrina del presidente Vladimir Putin, así como con el embajador ruso en Londres.","#Rusiagate ¿Quiénes son Paul Manafort, Rick Gates y George Papadopoulos? ¿Qué tienen que ver con Trump?",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/10/30/rusiagate-quienes-son-paul-manafort-rick-gates-y-george-papadopoulos-que-tienen-que-ver-con-trump_a_23261117/

Den Personen wird vorgeworfen, Terrorismus unterstützt zu haben

Nach dem gescheiterten Putsch 2016 in der Türkei haben Regierungskritiker Zuflucht in Deutschland gesucht. Etwa Hundert von ihnen droht nun eine Anklage wegen Terrorverdachts, berichten die ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"", NDR und WDR am Sonntag.

Demnach handelt sich dabei um türkische Akademiker, die 2016 einen offenen Brief an die türkische Regierung unterzeichnet hatten. In dem Brief wird der Umgang der türkischen Regierung mit den Kurden kritisiert.

In der Anklageschrift, die der ""SZ"", dem NDR und dem WDR vorliegen, heiße es, der Brief trage den Charakter ""der offenen Propaganda für die Terrororganisation PKK"". Die kurdische Arbeiterpartei (PKK) gilt in der Türkei - und auch in der EU - als Terror-Organisation und ist daher verboten.

Die Türkei und die PKK

In dem offenen Brief wird das Vorgehen der türkischen Sicherheitskräfte in kurdischen Siedlungsgebieten als ""Vernichtungs- und Vertreibungspolitik"" bezeichnet.

Der türkische Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan geht hart im eigenen Land gegen die kurdische Minderheit vor - und unterstützt die militärische Offensive der irakischen Regierung gegen das kurdische Autonomiegebiet.

In einem UN-Bericht vom März 2017 wurden der Türkei schwere Menschenrechtsverletzungen im Umgang mit der kurdischen Minderheit vorgeworfen.

Türkische Sicherheitskräfte hätten zwischen Juli 2015 und Dezember 2016 ganze Stadtteile im Südosten des Landes niedergemäht und bis zu einer halben Millionen Menschen vertrieben.

Ankara dagegen macht die verbotene PKK für Gewalt und Zerstörung verantwortlich. Die Unterzeichner des ""Friedensappels"" hatte Erdogan nach der Veröffentlichung des Briefs als Sympathisanten kurdischer Terroristen bezeichnet.

Auslieferung ist unwahrscheinlich

Nun folgt also die offizielle Anklage. Nach Informationen von ""SZ"", NDR und WDR sollen mindestens fünf Unterzeichner eine Anklage in den vergangenen Tagen erhalten haben. Auch die übrigen Unterzeichner müssten sich auf eine Anklage einstellen, heißt es in dem Bericht unter Berufung auf die türkische Staatsanwaltschaft.

Eine Auslieferung drohe den betroffenen Personen allerdings nicht, berichten ""SZ"", NDR und WDR weiter. In Deutschland sei dafür das örtlich zuständige Oberlandesgericht zuständig - und bei den Gerichten herrsche mittlerweile eine ""erhöhte Skepsis"" gegenüber Vorwürfen aus der Türkei.

Allerdings drohe den nach Deutschland geflohenen Türken, dass sie international zur Fahndung ausgeschrieben werden würden. Dann könnten sie nicht mehr gefahrlos reisen.

Diese 10 Bilder machen das Ausmaß der Schäden deutlich

Abgedeckte Häuser, umgestürzte Baugerüste, überflutete Straßen: Sturmtief ""Herwart"" hat am Wochenende Europa verwüstet. Mehrere Menschen starben, zwei von ihnen auch in Deutschland.

Als der Sturm abflaute, begann vielerorts das große Aufräumen. Die Deutsche Bahn stoppte am Sonntag in sieben Bundesländern ihren Fernverkehr, weitergehen soll es erst wieder am Montag.

Bilder zeigen versperrte Straßen und beschädigte Häuser. Diese 10 Fotos machen deutlich, wie schwer ""Herwart"" in Europa gewütet hat.

In Osteuropa starben mehrere Menschen. In Polen kam ein Mann bei einem sturmbedingten Autounfall ums Leben.

In Tschechien wurde eine Frau bei einem Waldspaziergang bei Trebic (Trebitsch) von einem Baum erschlagen. Ein Mann starb, als er in der böhmischen Kleinstadt Jicin (Jitschin) von einem Baum getroffen wurde, wie die Agentur CTK berichtete.

Hunderttausende Haushalte waren in ganz Tschechien ohne Strom, weil Freileitungen beschädigt wurden.

Wegen der schweren Schäden durch Sturm ""Herwart"" kann die Deutsche Bahn den Betrieb wichtiger Strecken im Fernverkehr erst am Montag wieder aufnehmen.

► Zahlreiche Reisende strandeten am Sonntag daher im Hauptbahnhof in Hamburg:

Ein Mann starb auf einem Campingplatz in Niedersachsen. Er übernachtete in einem Bulli und wollte sich beim Herannahen des Wassers zu fuß in Sicherheit bringen, erklärte die Polizei.

Der 59 Jahre alte Bruder konnte sich noch an einem Mast festhalten. Er wurde am frühen Morgen von einer DLRG-Schlauchbootbesatzung gerettet und unterkühlt in ein Krankenhaus gebracht. Der 63-Jährige wurde wenig später tot geborgen.

► Dieses Foto zeigt den überflutete Campingplatz:

Der Wind erreichte Geschwindigkeiten von bis zu 176 Kilometer pro Stunde am Fichtelberg und 144 Kilometer pro Stunde auf Fehmarn. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern brachte “Herwart” wesentlich stärkere Orkanböen als sein Vorgänger “Xavier” Anfang Oktober, beispielsweise 140,8 Stundenkilometer über Hiddensee-Dornbusch, wie der Meteorologe Uwe Ulbrich vom Wetterstudio Hiddensee sagte.



Der Wind wird sich in Deutschland zu Wochenbeginn wieder abschwächen, zugleich fallen die Temperaturen. In der Nacht zum Montag sollte es bis auf 600 Meter hinunter schneien, wie der Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) am Sonntag in Offenbach mitteilte. Am Montag bleibt es überwiegend trocken.

Fiji, Lebanon & Tonga singing in the sheds. War dances & hymns. Tartan shorts. Straw hats. What a weekend. — Name cannot be blank (@tyhrblue) 29 de outubro de 2017

Every game was great on the weekend. Even the predictable blowouts had their lovely moments. The whole thing was just great fun. Which when you think about it, is what sport's supposed to be.

The RLWC has been held 14 times previously. Australia has won ten times, England thrice and New Zealand once. It was kind of exciting in 2008 when the Kiwis won. But the tournament as a whole has always been a pale imitation of the Rugby World Cup (as in: the one for rugby union).

That's because rugby league is player in fewer nations than rugby union. And the only way rugby league could even stage a world cup was to co-opt Australian NRL players with ethnic backgrounds into playing for teams like Lebanon and Italy.

That's still happening this year, which is why Parramatta's Mitchell Moses is standing attractively in his striped undies in the video above after Lebanon beat France in a thriller in Canberra.

But something else happened in the lead-up to the 2017 Cup that has helped spice up this tournament. Top NRL players who could have been picked for Australia or New Zeaalnd chose instead to play for the countries of their birth, or their parents' birth.

Jason Taumololo -- named the NRL's equal-best player in 2016 -- turned his back on the Kiwis because he ""wanted to give something back"" to Tonga (where his parents were born).

Rugby league authorities had two choices at this point. They could kick up a stink, or they could allow it to happen for the greater good of the game. The great good prevailed. And the result? Tonga spanked Scotland 50-4, after having lost to them at the 2013 RLWC. And the sport became ever so slightly more genuinely international.

Even the opening match between Australian and England had a lovely vibe. The match itself was tense, as Australia really only put England to to bed with a late try. As a bonus, Melburnians got one last chance to farewell halfback Cooper Cronk, who is off to the Roosters.

The best moment of the weekend? You mean apart from the Lebanon players dancing?

And the Lebanon supporters dancing?

And the scene in the Fiji room after they easily beat the U.S.A.?

The weekend highlight had to be the crowd noise at Port Moresby. Did you know that Papua New Guinea is the only country in the world where rugby league is the national sport? Well you do now.

The Rugby League World Cup goes for another four weeks. The last two weeks of that feature the women's World Cup too.

This all seemed like some pretty low grade sporting spakfilla before the cricket season at first, but not now.

Von Januar bis Dezember räkelt sich eine andere Traumfrau auf der Motorhaube, als hätte sie nicht verstanden, wie sie anders in den Innenraum des Autos gelangen soll. Frauen werden seit der Erfindung des Rades des völligen Unverständnisses für die Männerträume auf vier Reifen verdächtigt. Wohl kaum ein anderes Klischee hat es in der Popkultur derart weit gebracht und wird so häufig in Büchern, Filmen und augenrollenden Gesprächen thematisiert. Dass Frauen durchaus etwas mit Autos anfangen können und was an den größten Mythen dran ist, zeigt unser Vorurteilscheck in Zusammenarbeit mit der Allianz.

Mythos 1: Tücke der Parklücke – Frauen können nicht einparken

Es ist der Klassiker der Klischees: Frauen können ohne lastergroße Lücken und unendliche Weiten zum mehrzügigen Rangieren einfach nicht einparken. Der Mythos mangelnder weiblicher Parkkünste hält sich hartnäckig, dabei erheben sich aus Studien protestierende Gegenstimmen. So zeigten beispielsweise Untersuchungen der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, dass vor allem das negative Selbstbild der Fahrerinnen zu schlechten Parkergebnissen führe. Andere Studien beschäftigten sich mit dem sozialpsychologischen Phänomen der „Bedrohung durch Stereotypen“. Die Tatsache, dass Frauen sich am Steuer ständig mit dem Vorurteil vermeintlicher Parkunfähigkeit konfrontiert sehen, verunsichert und schafft Misstrauen gegenüber den eigenen Fahrkünsten. Ein britischer Parkplatz-Betreiber will sogar herausgefunden haben, dass sich Männer einfach schneller mit ihrer Parkleistung zufriedengeben. Frauen hingegen strebten nach Perfektion und bräuchten dementsprechend länger. Die Mutter aller Mythen fußt somit auf vorurteilsbedingtem Mangel an Selbstbewusstsein bei Frauen und der unbescheidenen männlichen Begeisterung über die eigenen Parkfertigkeiten. Als Gegenmittel empfehlen wie den Damen an dieser Stelle, nie müde zu werden, süffisant grinsende Fahrer auf ihr schief geparktes Auto hinzuweisen.

Mythos 2: Spaß am Gas – Frauen kennen keine Fahrfreude

Während der Gedanke an Pferdestärken männliches Blut zur Wallung bringt, können Frauen darüber nun wirklich nicht jubilieren. Bei diesem Vorurteil scheint die Zeit irgendwann in den 1950er Jahren stehengeblieben zu sein. Das Klischee, der unmotivierte Fahrer vor dem eigenen Auto müsse ein Opa mit Hut oder eine Frau sein, kann relativ leicht ausgehebelt werden. Eine Umfrage des Autobauers Ford ergab Anfang des Jahres beispielsweise, dass Männer und Frauen bei der Fahrt eines schnittigen Sportwagens den gleichen Fahrspaß empfinden. Die Emanzipation ist längst am Gas-Pedal angekommen und so genießen auch Fahrerinnen den Sprint über die Straße. Zwar sind die Männer in Flensburg punktemäßig stärker vertreten, allerdings ist das häufigste Vergehen unter weiblichen Punktesünderinnen die zu schnelle Fahrt. Doch wehe dem, der da jetzt den Finger hebt und auf ein erhöhtes Unfallpotenzial verweist. Die Verkehrsunfallszahlen des Statistischen Bundeamtes beweisen regelmäßig, dass Frauen weniger unfallanfällig sind als Männer. Eine gute Kfz-Versicherung ist hingegen geschlechtsunabhängig der Garant für Fahrspaß mit sicherem Gefühl. Die Allianz bietet dazu individuellen Schutz für jeden Fahrer – und jede Fahrerin.

Mythos 3: Porsche statt Püppchen – Mädchen spielen nicht mit Autos

Wie viel neidisches Gebrüll mag es unter Weihnachtsbäumen schon gegeben haben, wie viele tränennasse Puppenkleidchen angesichts von vier Kubikmetern Lego und den Rennstrecken großer Brüder. Doch da lässt sich leider nichts machen, denn Barbie und Co. sind die idealen Spielsachen für Mädchen. Dass dieser Mythos eher von klassischen Rollenbildern als kindlichen Neigungen am Leben gehalten wird, zeigen verschiedene Erhebungen. Dem Bundesverband des Spielwareneinzelhandels zufolge gibt es immer mehr Mädchen, die lieber mit Autos spielen. Studien zufolge fördere der Rollentausch von Miniatur-Schönheitssalon und Rennbahn die kognitive und emotionale Entwicklung. Gewisse Vorlieben lassen sich natürlich nicht absprechen, doch freuen sich auch die meisten Prinzessinnen über Rennautos. Ein Experiment der französischen Supermarktkette Les Magasins U kommt zu einem ganz ähnlichen Ergebnis. Kaum waren Jungs und Mädchen mit der vollen Bandbreite von Auto bis Zauber-Barbie allein, griffen kleine Superhelden zu Puppen, Mädchen nach Bohrmaschinen und Bentleys.

Mythos 4: Wo bin ich? Frauen haben keinen Orientierungssinn

Wenn es einen Zusammenhang gibt, über den sich Wissenschaftler nicht einigen können, dann ist es der zwischen Geschlecht und Orientierungssinn. Den Wissenschaftlern der Norwegian University of Science and Technology zufolge sind Männer dank des Testosterons und der Orientierung an Himmelsrichtungen im Orientierungsvorteil. Frauen orientierten sich eher an festen Wegpunkten. Zwei Wissenschaftlerinnen der University of Edinburgh zufolge bietet dieser Umstand jedoch auch Vorteile. Zwar hätten Frauen ein schlechteres Gedächtnis für räumliche Anordnungen, doch gewährt die Navigation nach optischen Fixpunkten in mancher Umgebung bessere Auskunft. Dass sich Männer und Frauen unterschiedlich orientieren, setzt sich übrigens auch bei Ahnungslosigkeit fort. Eine Studie des Instituts Fly Research belegte die männliche Unbelehrbarkeit. Demnach nimmt jeder Vierte eine halbstündige Irrfahrt mit ungeahntem Ausgang in Kauf, bevor er nach dem Weg fragt.

Mythos 5: Fluchen und Funkeln – Männer donnern, Frauen dekorieren

Müssten Eigenschaften wie das Anschreien anderer Autofahrer oder Faustschwenken vor dem Abbiegen einem Geschlecht zugeordnet werden – die meisten würden auf die Männerwelt tippen. Doch eine Studie der Scout24-Gruppe wies nicht nur die Deutschen als Fluch-Europameister aus, sondern krönte zudem die Frauen zum fluchenden Geschlecht, das deinem Ärger lautstark Luft macht. Da wir schon einmal beim Thema Luft sind, ein dekoratives Vorurteil ist nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen. Ob Duftbäume mit Käsekuchen-Aroma, Kinderschühchen und Einhörner, die es zur 50 Liter Tankfüllung gratis dazu gab: Frauen stehen im Verdacht, ihren Rückspiegel als eine Art Hort für jegliches Sammelsurium zu nutzen. Das Resultat: Beim Fahren schwankt und funkelt allerhand am Rückspiegel und irritiert weit über die Grenzen des eigenen Autos hinaus. Beim Blick in manches Auto fällt es schwer, diesen Mythos auszuhebeln.

Alles andere als mythisch: Gut versichert mit der Allianz

For as long as I could remember I viewed anxiety as an enemy. Something that had bullied me since a child. A nagging voice. Something that had slowly taken a tight grip on my life.

At first I did not understand anxiety, I did not understand the overwhelming feelings of worry and dread and the irrational thoughts that had filled my head over the years. As a child I would lay awake frozen by fear and nightmare thoughts. My parents had gone out for the evening but what if something happened to them? What if they had gotten into an accident and died?

I became in a constant state of anxiety and hyper awareness, looking out for dangers before they could happen and believing that I could somehow stop them.

As I grew into my teenage years my anxiety manifested itself into depression and anger. I became confused by my own feelings, often unable to control them which swiftly followed on with bouts of frustration and sadness. I suddenly became superstitious, believing that if I walked over three drains on the pavement something horrendous would happen or if I came across the number 13 I had to cancel that number out and don't even get me started on if I had walked under a ladder in the street.

After all those years I was actually showing early signs of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. An anxiety disorder fuelled by unwanted thoughts and doubts.

As my anxiety grew stronger over the years, so did my thoughts. A 24 hour loop of unwanted sexual, harmful thoughts and images flickering through my head, my anxiety eating me away, taking my life bit by bit.

For as long as I could remember I had viewed anxiety as something abnormal, something I had associated with the worst times of my life. I began to fear the feeling, not allowing one little ounce of anxiety to creep in. The stomach churns petrified me, I avoided anything anxiety induced, anything which made the uncomfortable feelings creep back in. I could not face it, it became a phobia. I stopped going out, I stopped seeing friends, I stopped living my life.

What I did not realise was that anxiety was actually something that had been with me through the good times as well as the bad. It had been with me on my first day at university, my first day at my new job, my first date with my boyfriend. It was something that had stopped me from making mistakes, something that had made me step back from the wrong situations.

I had to learn that anxiety was in fact a normal human reaction, it was something that would never go. It was an emotion that was built within me, within all of us and acceptance of this had to be key to start my recovery.

I had to view it as a friend, a gauge for my health and for my wellbeing. It was not something to fear but something that I had to learn to live alongside. I had to be aware of when anxiety was starting to take over and also when it was there as a completely normal response. I knew it would take time, a long time but it had to be done.

It was something I would learn to control when it was bad but to let it be there in the right situations.

It is now something that I hope to eventually learn to accept as part of me.",Why I Had To Stop Fearing Anxiety,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/gina-hadden/why-i-had-to-stop-fearing_b_18400288.html

All across India, air quality plummets each autumn starting with the end of the monsoon season. Contributing factors include increased fuel burning, crop burning, and changing weather patterns. Then Diwali celebrations notoriously lead to spikes in air pollution, prompting bans on the sale of firecrackers this year in Delhi-NCR, with mixed results.

Air pollution consists of toxic gases and small, inhalable particles. Exposure to high levels of air pollution leads to acute and chronic diseases and even premature death. Particles 2.5 micrometres in diameter and smaller are also known as PM 2.5 . These particles are the most likely to lead to negative health effects since larger particles cannot penetrate deeply into the lungs. For this reason, the level of PM 2.5 in the air is the most useful metric for understanding the health impacts of particulate air pollution.

This figure shows a summary of measured PM 2.5 data for September 2016-October 2017 for cities across India. The pie charts show the number of days in the past year that the average PM 2.5 level fell into the following three categories: Green days (PM 2.5 < 35.4 μg m-3) are healthy or moderate, yellow days (35.5 μg m-3 to 55.4 μg m-3) are unhealthy for sensitive groups such as children, the elderly or those with lung disease, and red days (PM 2.5 > 55.5 μg m-3) is unhealthy for all. More details about the figure and data are available here.

The data show in concrete terms that Indians across the country are exposed to unhealthy air much of the year. Indeed, a 2017 report on the state of global air indicated that ""...Bangladesh and India now have the highest exposures to PM 2.5 , having experienced the steepest increases since 2010."" Therefore, our results were not a surprise, however, these data for PM 2.5 were not available in many locations until recently. Many more monitoring stations have come online in the past year. Some previous estimates of PM 2.5 exposure in India were based on extrapolations from measurements of larger particles (e.g., PM 10 ), and can be improved now that additional PM 2.5 data are available.

Show me the data

The first step towards improving air quality is collecting reliable data and making it open and available, however, high-quality PM 2.5 data are still not available for many locations across India, including entire states and major cities. India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) conducts routine measurements of PM 2.5 in some locations and established a national air quality index (AQI) in late 2014 as a simple means to communicate air quality data to the public. Collecting and maintaining data on emissions from pollution sources is a monumental task, and efforts by CPCB and local and state pollution control boards have been supplemented by university researchers and independent groups such as the U.S. diplomatic posts. Efforts by organisations like OpenAQ to aggregate and archive publicly available, ground-based data are important for analysis, and to help raise public awareness. Spatial and temporal resolution for air quality monitoring is improving, especially in the greater Delhi area, but more continuous monitoring coverage is needed across the country. Monitoring must eventually extend beyond the urban centres to understand the country-wide impact of air pollution.

On the sidelines of a lecture given to Stellenbosch University's Business School on Friday night, Motlanthe told Business Day that the elective conference was increasingly flawed owing to electoral irregularities.

He reportedly said that branches and the leagues should take the lead in the electoral process.

""Once all of those processes and requirements are disregarded and delegates to the conference are not elected by members but handpicked by leaders on the basis of perceived support, it defeats the purpose of the majority of delegates being delegates from branches.

Also on Friday, Motlanthe warned that democracy should not be taken for granted, according to Fin24. He said that ""strategic action"" should be taken to address challenges, and said that inclusive growth was necessary to address inequality.

""This view is increasing, questioning the capitalist system's ability to attend to challenges... It is important for countries to focus on competitiveness while keeping an eye on other factors. We always operate in a wider economic community,"" Motlanthe reportedly said.

Motlanthe has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the ANC. He lost to President Jacob Zuma in a presidential election at Mangaung in 2012.

In an address to the launch of the Olof Palme Youth Education Initiative at Midrand High School earlier this month, Motlanthe was critical of the frequent Cabinet reshuffles that have occurred during Zuma's tenure.

According to News24, he said: ""[The new minister comes with] 14 to 16 new senior managers without first going into the department and understanding the strength and institutional memory which resides in the department. You know what that means? It means that the state is being destabilised and weakened...

Wer könnte besser wissen, was es damit auf sich hat, als Fantasy-Autor und Historiker Stephan M. Rother (49), der mit ""Ein Reif von Eisen"", dem ersten Teil der ""Königschroniken"", gerade die deutsche Antwort auf ""Game of Thrones"" vorgelegt hat?

Darum geht es bei den ""Königschroniken""

Hier gibt es die Buchvorlage zu ""Game of Thrones"" zu kaufen

Rother entwirft darin eine mittelalterliche Welt, die germanische und nordische Mythen, staufisches Kaisertum und orientalische Kulturen mit fantastischen Elementen kombiniert. Das Schicksal der Welt liegt in den Händen dreier Frauen: der Sklavin Ildris, die geheimnisvolle Kräfte besitzt, der jungen, ehrgeizigen Leyken aus dem Oasenvolk des Südens und Sölva, der unehelichen Tochter des Stammesfürsten Morwa. Können sie gegen die Dunkelheit bestehen? Kann eine von ihnen das Land aus der Dunkelheit führen?

Doch wie viel Wahrheit steckt in den Chroniken? Was ist dran an den Mythen, die uns heute noch erschauern lassen? Wie gruselig war das Mittelalter wirklich? Die Antworten darauf liefert der Fantasy-Autor der Nachrichtenagentur spot on news.

Stephan Rother über die Ursprünge von Halloween

Rother: Samhain, der Ursprung des Halloweenfestes, markierte bei den Kelten den Beginn des Winters. Die Natur stirbt dahin, der Gedanke an menschliche Vergänglichkeit liegt nahe, und die Schleier des Nebels können Sie in diesen Tagen beinahe mit Händen greifen. Die Toten sind unterwegs; mit dem Allerheiligenfest konnte die christliche Kirche die Auswahl auf die freundlicheren Toten beschränken. Allerdings hat das Mittelalter auch insgesamt einen eher praktischen Umgang mit dem Tod. Wenn sie an einer Krankheit leiden, fesseln sie diese Krankheit nach den Anweisungen eines Rituals an einen Riemen aus Hirschleder, den sie anschließend einem Toten mit ins Grab geben. Dem Toten kann die Krankheit nicht mehr schaden, und sie sind ihr Gebrechen los.

In ""Ein Reif von Eisen"" wimmelt es von solchen Ritualen, von Hexen und von finsterer Magie. Haben die Menschen des Mittelalters tatsächlich an so etwas geglaubt?

Rother: Sie haben daran geglaubt, wie ein Kranker an die Wirksamkeit seiner Medizin glaubt, selbst wenn es sich in Wahrheit um einen Placebo handelt. Obwohl das Präparat gar keine Wirkstoffe enthält, wird schon dieser Glaube eine positive Wirkung haben. Wenn Sie selbst und alle Menschen um Sie herum davon überzeugt sind, dass im Sumpf der Geist eines Gehenkten umgeht, werden Sie in nebligen Nächten womöglich die erstaunlichsten Dinge zu sehen bekommen.

Für die Figuren in ""Ein Reif von Eisen"" scheinen solche gruseligen Erscheinungen fast zum Alltag zu gehören.

Rother: Heute haben wir den Bewegungsmelder, der unsichtbar den Gartenzaun bewacht. Das Mittelalter kennt ein ähnliches System: Die Hage-Zussa, die geisterhafte Hecken-Sitzerin, aus der sich unser Wort 'Hexe' entwickelt hat. Oder nehmen Sie eine freundlich-sprudelnde Quelle: Für das Mittelalter ist sie zugleich ein unheimlicher Ort. Wo das Wasser aus der Welt des Unsichtbaren in die Welt des Sichtbaren tritt, muss das auch umgekehrt möglich sein. Quellen gelten als Einstieg in das Totenreich der Göttin Hel, die 'Hölle'. Als 'Frau Holle' hat die düstere Göttin bis heute überlebt. Unsere Wohnungstür sichern wir mit einem Türalarm. Im Mittelalter wird ein Bauopfer unter der Türschwelle beigesetzt, an dem die Unholde sich gütlich tun können, so dass sie keinen Grund mehr haben, die Wohnung zu betreten.

In einer besonders blutigen Szene in ""Ein Reif von Eisen"" kauert der junge Dieb Pol unter dem Schafott. Auffällig ist, dass die Henker offenbar eine Fülle von Regeln zu beachten haben.

Rother: Da war das Mittelalter penibel. Zur Enthauptung kniet der Verurteilte aufrecht vor dem Henker, der ihm aus der Körperdrehung heraus mit dem Richtschwert den Kopf abschlägt. Ein Bewegungsablauf, der Golfspielern vertraut sein dürfte. Wobei Henker vor Missgeschicken keineswegs gefeit sind: Geht der erste Schlag in Nacken oder Hinterkopf, wird meist um Nachschlag gebeten. Das ist tatsächlich der Fachbegriff. Besondere Stümper unter den Henkern mussten bis zu einem Dutzend Mal zuschlagen und konnten dann froh sein, wenn sie von der Menge nicht ihrerseits gelyncht wurden. Andererseits wird von wahren Meistern ihrer Kunst berichtet, denen es gelang, zwei Verurteilte mit ein und demselben Schlag zu enthaupten oder aber mitsamt dem Opfer auch noch einen Blumenstrauß zu köpfen, den dieses in der Hand hielt.

Enthauptungen gehörten also zu den grausamsten Strafen?

Rother: Ganz im Gegenteil. Beim Vierteilen wird das Opfer von Pferden auseinandergerissen, die an seine Arme und Beine gebunden werden. Meist ist der Körper des Verurteilten zu diesem Zeitpunkt aber bereits ausgeweidet worden. Chroniken der Kreuzfahrerzeit wiederum berichten davon, dass lediglich der Anfang der Gedärme an einen Pfahl gebunden wurde, woraufhin man die Opfer solange unter Peitschenhieben im Kreis trieb, bis sie tot zusammenbrachen. Und wo die eigene Fantasie versagt, holt man sich Anregungen. Im Epos von Tristan und Isolde soll die Königin wegen ehelicher Untreue auf dem Scheiterhaufen verbrannt werden. Da macht eine Gruppe von hundert grässlich entstellten Aussätzigen den Vorschlag, man möge sie doch lieber ihnen übergeben. Die Krankheit steigere ihre Begierde. Was Isolde da erwarte, sei schrecklicher als jede Todesstrafe.

Sie selbst, Stephan M. Rother, sind ein Mensch unserer eigenen Zeit. Warum sind Sie selbst so fasziniert von dieser unheimlichen Zeit, dass Sie diese Geschichte geschrieben haben, ""Ein Reif von Eisen"", mit all ihren unheimlichen Details?

Rother: Ich halte mich selbst nicht für besonders abergläubisch. Doch gilt nicht der Skorpion als unheimlichstes unter den Tierkreiszeichen? Nicht ohne Grund fällt auch Halloween in das Zeichen des Skorpions, und ich selbst bin als Skorpion wenige Tage vor Halloween zur Welt gekommen. Mein Großvater war übrigens ein sehr gefragter Wünschelrutengänger und hätte mit Sicherheit eine Menge über die Welt des Unsichtbaren zu erzählen gewusst. Leider habe ich nichts von seiner Gabe geerbt - doch vielleicht habe ich ja meinen eigenen Weg gefunden?",Stephan M.

Spacey, 58, issued the statement after a BuzzFeed News report alleged that the “House of Cards” star had sexually harassed Rapp when he was just 14. In his statement, Spacey did not deny the incident but said he could “not remember the encounter.”

“If I did behave then as [Rapp] describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior,” Spacey wrote.

The Oscar-winning actor then came out as gay, saying Rapp’s story had “encouraged me to address other things about my life.”

Spacey’s statement was met with fury online, with many accusing him of coming out as a “PR smokescreen.” Others lambasted Spacey for using drunkenness as an apparent excuse for his alleged behavior. Here’s a sampling of the online censure:

Das Urteil löste im ganzen Land heftige Kritik und Empörung aus. Hunderte Menschen gingen am Freitagabend in Lissabon, in Porto - wo das umstrittene Urteil gefällt wurde - und anderen Städten des Landes auf die Straße, um gegen das Urteil zu protestieren.

In der Hauptstadt skandierten die Demonstranten unter anderem ""Machismo ist ein Verbrechen"". Sie trugen auch Plakate mit Aufschriften wie ""Im 21. Jahrhundert wollen wir keine Richter des 19. Jahrhunderts!""

SMITH FALLS, Ont. — Constellation Brands has signed a deal to acquire a nearly 10 per cent stake in Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth Corp. for $245 million.

The companies said Monday the agreement will see Constellation provide marketing and brand development support to Canopy.

They will also collaborate in the development of cannabis-based drinks.

Constellation Brands bills itself as the third-largest beer company in the U.S., ""with high-end, iconic imported brands such as Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Pacifico."" It also sells numerous wine and spirit brands.

Watch: Constellation Brands profit soars 40%

Constellation said the deal is part of its strategy to stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, while maintaining focus on its core beverage alcohol business.

""Canopy Growth has a seasoned leadership team that understands the legal, regulatory and economic landscape for an emerging market that is predicted to become a significant consumer category in the future,"" said Constellation chief executive Rob Sands.

Constellation added that it has no plans to sell any cannabis products in the U.S. or any other market unless or until it is legally permissible to do so at all government levels.

Canopy said the deal gives it a strategic ally.

""We have also strengthened our balance sheet to fund the ambitious expansion efforts we have planned heading into 2018 – a year that will see unprecedented growth in medical and adult-use opportunities,"" Canopy chairman and chief executive Bruce Linton said.

Under the deal, Constellation will buy a 9.9 per cent stake or nearly a 18.9 million shares in Canopy for $12.9783 per share. It will also acquire an equal number of common share purchase warrants for Canopy.

Canopy shares fell 16 cents to close at $12.79 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday.

Zuspruch kam aus der Wirtschaft, Kritik von der SPD

Kaum ist die große Koalition Geschichte, wird eines ihrer Rentenprojekte zerpflückt: die Rente mit 63.

CDU-Präsidiumsmitglied Jens Spahn verlangte in der ""Rheinischen Post"" ihre Abschaffung. Diese ""Form der Frühverrentung"" sollte auslaufen und das Geld lieber in die Renten von Witwen und Erwerbsgeminderten investiert werden, argumentierte er. ""Die Rente mit 63 für langjährig Versicherte wird vor allem von männlichen Facharbeitern genutzt, die wir eigentlich noch brauchen.""

IW-Direktor ist für die Abschaffung

Der Direktor des arbeitgebernahen Instituts der deutschen Wirtschaft (IW) Köln, Michael Hüther, sagte der ""Welt"", die Rente mit 63 müsse ""rückabgewickelt"" werden. Mehr als 200.000 Arbeitskräfte hätten deswegen schon zu arbeiten aufgehört – alles gut verdienende Menschen mit mittlerer und höherer Bildung.

""Wenn ich Grüne und FDP wäre, würde ich die Union da vor mir hertreiben"", sagte Hüther mit Blick auf die Jamaika-Sondierungen. Zudem müsse man darüber nachdenken, ab 2029 das Renteneintrittsalter auch über 67 Jahre hinaus zu erhöhen.

Nach Angaben der Deutschen Rentenversicherung Bund haben bis Ende August 160.000 Versicherte einen Antrag auf abschlagsfreie Rente mit 63 gestellt. Im Vorjahreszeitraum waren es noch 165.000.

Kritik von der SPD

Wer mindestens 45 Jahre in die Rentenversicherung eingezahlt hat, kann seit Juli 2014 ab 63 Jahren ohne Abschlag in Rente gehen. Allerdings wird diese Altersgrenze seitdem pro Jahr um zwei Monate angehoben, so dass die Jahrgänge ab 1964 erst mit 65 nach 45 Jahren abschlagsfrei in Renten gehen können. Die ""Rente mit 63"" ist insofern etwas missverständlich.

Die frühere Bundesfamilienministerin Manuela Schwesig (SPD) wies den Vorstoß Spahns zurück. ""Das zeigt, wie die CDU heute tickt. Da ist mehr soziale Kälte als soziale Verantwortung zu spüren"", sagte sie dem SWR.

Das Vorstandsmitglied des Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (DGB), Annelie Buntenbach, hielt Spahn entgegen: ""Wer die Rente mit 63 zurückdrehen will, ignoriert schlicht die Lebenswirklichkeit vieler Menschen. Wir brauchen nicht weniger Möglichkeiten für Beschäftigte, vor dem 67. Lebensjahr in Rente gehen zu können, sondern mehr."" Viele erreichten heute schon den regulären Rentenbeginn nicht.

Der Wirtschaftsrat der CDU sieht in einem Jamaika-Bündnis die große Chance, das SPD-Projekt der Rente mit 63 zu beerdigen, und unterstützt den Vorstoß Spahns.

Die Mütterrente

Die CSU wollte in den Jamaika-Sondierungen auch eine weitere Erhöhung der Mütterrente fordern. Dabei geht es um Mütter, deren Kinder vor 1992 geboren wurden. Sie sollen einen Rentenpunkt mehr bekommen und damit genauso viel wie Mütter, deren Kinder nach diesem Datum geboren wurden. Ein Rentenpunkt für diese Frauen kostet zwischen sechs und sieben Milliarden Euro.

Die Grünen-Fraktionsvorsitzende Katrin Göring-Eckardt sagte im ARD-""Morgenmagazin"": ""Für mich ist das Entscheidende, dass wir keine Altersarmut mehr haben."" Die Mütterrente sei dafür nicht das richtige Instrument. Besser wäre eine ""Garantierente"". Wer lange gearbeitet habe, solle mehr haben als die Grundsicherung.

Die Präsidentin des Sozialverbands VdK, Ulrike Mascher, forderte die vollständige Angleichung der Mütterrente sowie eine Stabilisierung des Rentenniveaus und dessen Anhebung auf 50 Prozent.

Die aber gibt sich unbeeindruckt - und ruft ihre parteiinternen Kritiker auf den Plan

Von Rücktritt ist die Rede - und einem Neuanfang mit einem neuen Kanzlerkandidaten

Es ist der Tag nach der Niedersachsen-Pleite. Doch Kanzlerin Merkel wirkt, als kommentiere sie das fröhliche Herbstwetter.

Ihre Partei sei durch die Wahl nicht geschwächt, sie gehe ""selbstbewusst in die Sondierungsgespräche zu Jamaika"", erklärt sie am Montag im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus.

Viele andere in der Partei starren nur auf die schlechten Ergebnisse in Niedersachsen und bei der Bundestagswahl zwei Wochen zuvor. Sie sprechen von einem Ende der Ära Merkel - und laden ihren Frust ab.

Wie etwa bei der Bundestagsabgeordneten Sylvia Pantel.

Unter der Oberfläche brodelt es

Ihr Telefon stand am Morgen nicht mehr still. Bei ihr meldeten sich aufgebrachte Parteifreunde, denen die Geduld ausgeht. ""Sie fürchten, dass wir noch weitere Stimmen an die AfD verlieren und sorgen sich um das Profil unserer Partei"", sagt sie im HuffPost-Gespräch. ""Ich kann das nachvollziehen"".

Pantel erwartet von ihrer Partei nun Veränderungen. Und die müssen ganz oben anfangen. Es brauche einen Merkel-Nachfolger.

""Die CDU muss einen Kandidaten aufbauen"", fordert sie. ""Nichte heute, nicht morgen, aber in der Mitte der Legislatur brauchen wir hier Klarheit."" Vor vier Jahren habe man die Nachfolgeregelung versäumt. Jetzt sei es höchste Zeit. ""Ich bin überzeugt davon, dass ein Großteil der CDU-Wähler kein ""Weiter so"" will.""

""Ein Kandidat, der Merkel ablösen soll""

Pantel ist klar, dass sie damit ein Tabu in der Politik bricht.

In der Öffentlichkeit wird nicht über die Zeit nach dem Amtsinhaber spekuliert. Pantel macht das trotzdem - und hofft, dass möglichst viele in der CDU mitmachen. ""Häufig ist es doch so: Wer sich zuerst mit einer guten Idee herauswagt, wird öffentlich an den Pranger gestellt. Zwei Jahre später wollen es dann alle gesagt haben.""

Ganz alleine ist sie in der CDU mit ihrer Forderung aber nicht.

""Unreflektiertes Weiterso""

Die Werteunion, ein Zusammenschluss konservativer Kreise der Partei, fordert gar Merkels Rücktritt. Der Zusammenschluss verschickte eilig nach den ersten Hochrechnung einen ""Fahrplan zur Übergabe der Kanzlerschaft"".

Merkel müsse als Parteivorsitzende zurücktreten, heißt es darin. Die Wähler in Niedersachsen hätten ein ""unreflektiertes Weiterso der Kanzlerin nach der desaströsen Bundestagswahl abgestraft"".

Solche Maximalforderungen liegen auf der Empörungsskala freilich ganz weit oben und sind sicher nicht merheitsfähig in der CDU. Auch wollen einflussreiche CDU-Politiker davon nichts wissen. Die Frage stelle sich nicht, sagen sie - oder drücken sich moderater aus.

""Unangreifbarkeit von Merkel ist nicht mehr aufrechtzuerhalten""

Der CDU-Wirtschaftsrat etwa gab der Kanzlerin am Sonntag eine Mitschuld an dem niedersächsischen Ergebnis.

""Der Schlüssel für die Niederlage in Hannover liegt leider im Berliner Wahlabend am 24. September, als man die verheerenden Verluste von über acht Prozent zu einem strategischen Sieg schöngeredet hat"", sagt der Generalsekretär Wolfgang Steiger der ""Bild"".

Und CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer sprach von einem ""Alarmsignal für die gesamte Union"".

Angesichts solcher Äußerungen beschreiben Beobachter Merkel mindestens als angeschlagen.

""Die Position von Merkel ist in ihrer Unangreifbarkeit nicht mehr aufrechtzuerhalten"", sagt etwa der Politik-Experte Wolfgang Oberreuter im Gespräch mit der HuffPost.

""Merkels Beruhigungspillen werden einige in der Partei nicht mehr anstandslos schlucken"", sagt er. Und in dem Augenblick, in dem über ihre Nachfolge offen diskutiert werde, sei ihre Führungskraft geschwächt.

""Massive inhaltliche Auseinandersetzungen""

Noch deutlicher drückt sich der Berliner Politologe Albrecht von Lucke aus. ""Merkels Ende ist eingeleitet"", sagte er dem Nachrichtensender N24. Es gehe vor allem um eine ""massive inhaltliche Auseinandersetzung"" in der Partei - eine Art Stellvertreterkrieg der Merkel-Anhänger und -Gegner.

""Eine Fraktion macht sich stark, die die Union nach rechts ziehen will"". Dass das sogar die Sondierungsgespräche mit den Jamaika-Parteien treffen könnte, gab sogar Merkel indirekt zu.

Die Gefahr ist groß, dass sich die Verhandlungsparteien mit ihren Forderungen und roten Linien überwerfen, allen voran die angeschlagene Union. Die Gespräche werden deswegen einige Wochen dauern, sagte die Kanzlerin.

Wenigstens das klang nicht so, als ginge es gerade ums Wetter.

Le chef du gouvernement espagnol Mariano Rajoy avait lui-même annoncé ces élections régionales, placées sous son contrôle. Il avait déchu de leurs fonctions le président de l'exécutif catalan et son équipe, et chargé la vice-présidente du gouvernement espagnol, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, d'administrer la région.

Participer tout en qualifiant ces élections d'""illégitimes""

Oriol Junqueras, président du parti Gauche républicaine de Catalogne (ERC, membre de la coalition indépendantistes avec le PDeCAT de Puigdemont) -par ailleurs vice-président destitué de l'exécutif catalan- a également indiqué son intention de ""participer"" d'une manière ou d'une autre à ces élections, bien qu'il les juge ""illégitimes"".

""Les Catalans ne craignent pas les urnes (...) et le 21 décembre doit être une opportunité supplémentaire pour consolider la république"" catalane, a déclaré le porte-parole de ERC, Sergi Sabria, à l'issue d'une réunion de son parti à Barcelone.

Bush of groping them from his wheelchair during photo-ops, the sexual harassment conversation that exploded three weeks ago with Harvey Weinstein is poised to fell yet another social more: the idea that the actions of a “dirty old man” should be simply shrugged off.

“Dirty old man” just joined “boys just being boys,” “the casting couch” and “harmless locker room talk” on the list of sexual harassment excuses that are in their death throes, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioner Chai R. Feldblum told HuffPost. “But just don’t pronounce them dead until we see the coffin.”

The Bush story is definitely a sign of the times though. Back in 2007, we all thought it was adorable that No. 41 ― at age 82 ― gave actress Teri Hatcher a peck on the cheek and a pat on the behind after their lunch together. He was labeled “frisky” then. What a difference a decade makes.

“There is no doubt that this greater focus on sexual harassment is a good thing,” Feldblum said, “because it won’t go away on its own.” And, no, she cuts no slack for men of any age ― even former presidents ― who behave or touch anyone else inappropriately.

Actresses Heather Lind and Jordana Grolnick both reported that they were posing for photos with the elder Bush when he groped their behinds and made an off-color joke. Grolnick and author Christina Baker Kline said he quietly joked about his favorite magician or his favorite book.

Grolnick said, “I felt his hand dig into my flesh” as they smiled for the photographer and Bush delivered his joke’s punchline: “David Cop-A-Feel.”

Some have suggested that Bush, 93, who suffers from a form of Parkinson’s disease and has been in a wheelchair for five years, should be given a pass and excused from the accusations of sexual harassment. NBC anchor Andrea Mitchell tweeted to that end:

Mrs Bush was at his side. He is in a wheelchair with Parkinson's syndrome. Really? Someone should be ashamed and it isn't '41. https://t.co/CGhy8yNX5i — Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) October 26, 2017

Not all agreed though that what Bush did was defensible.

Touching women's ""rears"" without consent is not cute even if you are a 93 year old former President in a wheelchair. 😐 — SocialnnPolitics (@SocialnnPolitic) October 26, 2017

The non-apology apology

Other possible excuses for Bush’s groping were offered up on social media, most notably that as people become elderly, they develop certain medical conditions that can result in a loss of impulse control.

Some suggested that if he cannot control himself in public, those who are responsible for his care must stop putting him in situations where inappropriate behavior can occur ― not just laugh uncomfortably at it and then look away.

Two statements of apology issued from Bush’s office indicated that the former president should be let off the hook because of his age or illness. Women saw the behavior as just another example of powerful men treating women and their bodies with a sense of entitlement.

The former president’s spokesman Jim McGrath initially told CNN that “President Bush would never — under any circumstance — intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended Ms. Lind. ” McGrath issued a followup statement after Grolnick told Deadspin that she too had been groped by the former president. The statement read: At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures. To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.

But Feldblum said that when it comes to harassment, it doesn’t matter what people think might be OK but rather how they behave.

Manafort left his Virginia condo and, with his attorney, walked into the FBI field office in Washington early Monday. A 12-count federal grand jury indictment unsealed shortly after his surrender includes charges of conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, failure to file foreign bank reports and false statements.

Manafort and Gates both pleaded not guilty to the charges in federal court.

Separately, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about Russian “dirt” he was offered on Hillary Clinton, according to a plea deal prosecutors unsealed Monday. George Papadopoulos, 30, pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 and has been cooperating in the Russia probe.

The charges are the first in the probe led by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director. Monday’s arrests come three days after news broke that a federal grand jury in Washington had filed charges stemming from Mueller’s investigation.

“Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work,” the indictment says. “In order to hide Ukraine payments from United States authorities, from approximately 2006 through at least 2016, Manafort and Gates laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and bank accounts.”

Failing to pay taxes allowed Manafort a “lavish lifestyle in the United States,” according to the indictment, which alleges he “spent millions of dollars on luxury goods and services for himself and his extended family through payments wired from offshore nominee accounts to United States vendors.”

Manafort laundered more than $18 million, which he used to buy property, goods and services in the U.S., the indictment alleges. He’s accused of spending $849,215 at one clothing store, $520,440 at another clothing store, about $934,000 at an antique rug store, $62,750 for a Mercedes Benz, and $47,000 for a Range Rover.

Reports have suggested federal investigators could use criminal charges as way to pressure those arrested into providing more information about alleged collusion between President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin to influence the election.

US President Donald Trump today said he will release all files associated with the assassination of former president John F Kennedy to end all ""conspiracy theories"".

Trump said this in a tweet a day after the National Archives, at his direction, released more than 2,800 secret files related to the assassination of Kennedy on November 22, 1963.

At the same time, he agreed to the request from various intelligence and security agencies mainly FBI and CBI, to withhold quite a number of such files, which remains away from the public domain, thus increasingly providing fodder to conspiracy theories.

In his tweet, Trump said after strict consultation with his Chief of Staff, General John Kelly, the CIA and other agencies, ""I will be releasing ALL JFK files"" other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living.

""I am doing this for reason of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest,"" Trump said, a day after he ordered a large number of JFK files still be under the wraps.

At the same time he ordered for a 180-day review of all such files.

""This temporary withholding from full public disclosure is necessary to protect against harm to the military defence, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure,"" Trump said in a memo.

The American public expects -- and deserves -- its government to provide as much access as possible to the Kennedy assassination records so that the people may finally be fully informed about all aspects of this pivotal event, Trump argued.

Trump's Attorney General Jeff Sessions agreed and said that there is need to expedite the process.

""We are working this weekend. We are going to be working every way possible to expedite the production of these documents as completely as possible and they will be virtually, completely revealed from the FBI files,"" he told Fox News in an interview.

Sessions said Trump is right to say to get these materials out.

""Some of documents have already been produced today and they will be moving faster, there will not be, I believe, any significant redactions - redaction that may have been suggested will not be in there,"" he said.

""There's going to be virtually complete disclosure. Some people who are alive may not need their names or their current addresses revealed.

Dans un teasing digne d'une télé réalité, Donald Trump a annoncé le 27 septembre être sur le point de dévoiler son choix pour le poste de présidente du Conseil des gouverneurs de la Réserve fédérale, la fameuse ""Fed"".

Son choix doit intervenir avant son départ pour une tournée asiatique le 3 novembre, le 2 novembre selon toute vraisemblance. ""Les gens attendent avec impatience ma décision sur l'identité du prochain président de la Fed, a indiqué Donald Trump. Ce sera quelqu'un qui, je l'espère, fera un travail fantastique.""

""J'ai quelqu'un de très précis en tête et je pense que tout le monde sera très impressionné"", a-t-il encore dit.

Janet Yellen, nommée en 2014 par Barack Obama, peut prétendre à un nouveau mandat de quatre ans. Mais elle ne fait pas partie des favoris. Selon les rumeurs les plus tenaces, et les plus crédibles, deux hommes tiennent la corde: Jerome Powell, un proche de Yellen, ancien de Wall Street, réputé pragmatique; et John Taylor, l'intellectuel de Stanford, plus dogmatique.

Si quelques autres noms circulent, comme ceux de Kevin Warsh et Gary Cohn, leurs chances de victoire semblent improbables. Voici ce qu'il faut savoir des deux prétendants à l'un des postes les plus influents des Etats-Unis, et du monde.

Le favori: Jerome Powell, le pragmatique de Wall Street

Pour l'instant, il a la faveur des sites de paris et des confidences de ""proches du président"". Collaborateur direct de Janet Yellen depuis 2012, il n'a jamais voté contre une de ses décisions, et est coutumier du fonctionnement de la Fed. ""C'est le candidat de la continuité. Il s'est très peu exprimé sur la politique monétaire, mais on imagine qu'il fera pareil qu'elle"", analyse Marc-Antoine Collard, chef économiste de Rothschild & Cie Gestion.

Avocat d'affaires de formation, il a commencé sa carrière à la banque d'investissement Dillon, Read & Co. Entre 1997 et 2005, il est aussi associé du fonds d'investissement Carlyle, l'un des plus importants au monde. Un pur produit de Wall Street qui a aussi eu un rôle secondaire au secrétariat du Trésor sous l'administration de Georges Bush (1989-1993).

S'il remporte le poste, il deviendra le premier président de la Fed à ne pas détenir un doctorat d'économie. Malgré cela, les marchés ne devraient pas, ou peu, réagir.

L'outsider: John Taylor, le théoricien de Stanford

En revanche, celui-là pourrait bien faire bouger les lignes. John Taylor, célèbre professeur de l'encore plus célèbre université de Stanford, est surtout connu des milieux économiques pour sa règle, dite ""règle de Taylor"", énoncée en 1993.

Sa formule permet, en théorie, de calculer de manière objective le taux d'intérêt le plus adapté à l'économie des Etats-Unis. Cela tombe bien, c'est justement le job du gouverneur de la Fed.

""Sauf que cette règle dépend de variables qu'on ne peut pas connaître à l'instant T, et qu'il faut donc estimer, avertit Marc-Antoine Collard, de Rothschild & Cie Gestion. Avec toute l'honnêteté du monde, c'est très compliqué. La probabilité que la Fed fasse une erreur me semble plus importante.""

Sa position serait favorable à une hausse des taux d'intérêt plus rapide que le rythme très modéré prévu par Janet Yellen. Quelle serait la réaction des marchés en cas de victoire? Difficile à dire, tant cela dépendrait de son comportement d'ici sa prise de fonction en février.

""Il pourrait y avoir une réaction initiale avec une hausse des taux à court terme, et peut-être à long terme aussi. Mais si le marché pense que la Fed se trompe, que cette décision va provoquer une récession, cela peut aussi se traduire par une baisse des taux à long terme"", tente de résumer Marc-Antoine Collard.

En clair, si les marchés redoutent un retournement économique, les investisseurs pourraient être tenté de placer leur argent en sûreté, en achetant des bonds du trésor américain, d'où la baisse de leur rendement.

A total of 48% of all people living with psoriasis in the UK are lonely, compared to 33% living with psoriasis globally. Around 40% of women and 39% of men in the UK feel isolated due to psoriasis, compared to the global averages of 26% and 21% respectively.

The first World Psoriasis Happiness Report shows the UK ranks third from bottom based on wellbeing responses from more than 120,00 people living with psoriasis across 184 countries.

Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that can cause red, flaky, crusty patches of skin that are sometimes covered in silvery scales. As well as causing physical symptoms, psoriasis can lead to psychological distress and feelings of social isolation.

There are 1.3 million people in the UK living with psoriasis , but the vast majority (84%) feel there is a lack of public awareness around the condition.

“The impact the condition has on your mental wellbeing is often overlooked.”

Pete, 32, began suffering from psoriasis at the age of eight.

“I suffer with psoriasis on my face, scalp, ears, back, legs, knees, arms and elbows so hiding it from public view is at most times impossible.

“I often find myself being very self-conscious, covering my skin to avoid awkward looks from the scars left by the condition, which are a permanent reminder that this autoimmune disease will be with me for life.

“As we move into cooler months my anxiety levels go through the roof as I know it’s the time of the year where my psoriasis will flare up and be at its worse, the plaques will worsen and be more visible and the itch can cause me to have multiple nights without sleep.

“Psoriasis has been part of my life from about the age of eight, but I was only formally diagnosed with psoriasis three years ago when I moved GP, prior to that it was misdiagnosed as dermatitis.

“Around Christmas 2016 a new GP arrived at our doctor’s surgery and he was the first person in 23 years to ask me how the condition makes me feel, I now see him exclusively for ongoing treatment.

“Ultimately the lack of understanding from family, friends and colleagues can at times make you feel out of place and alone.”





“Psoriasis is not contagious.”

Sam Winters, 25, had his first psoriasis flare up at 19.

“When you have visible patches of psoriasis, people ask what it is (if they bother to ask at all). If they don’t know about psoriasis, quite often people are visibly disturbed which doesn’t make you feel brilliant. I’ve been asked at the gym if I should really be exposing areas affected by psoriasis in communal spaces in case I infect others.

“It definitely puts me off going into public spaces during a bad flare up. Fortunately mine tends to be on my arms, legs and scalp so can be covered, but it must be a lot harder for those who aren’t so lucky.

“You’d think people think you had leprosy or something from some reactions. Psoriasis definitely has a strong mental impact along with the physical discomfort.”





“Psoriasis is not a cosmetic issue.”

Ciena Rae Nelson, 25, began experiencing symptoms aged four.

“I think that the one thing I want people to know is that Psoriasis is not a cosmetic issue. It is not simply a rash.

“It is an autoimmune disorder that can have a negative impact on the quality of life and sometimes very serious negative affects on the general health of its sufferers.

“Sometimes it feels like I’m trapped in my own body. Unbearable itchiness that feels like stinging instead of itching. I suffer from sleep deprivation because I itch in my sleep. Dehydration is also a side effect, which at one point put me in the hospital when I had a psoriasis flare of 80% of my body.

“As long as we treat it like a cosmetic issue, we are not going to raise the awareness we need to find a cure.”





“It makes dating hard.”

Holly Dillon, late twenties, was diagnosed with guttate psoriasis aged 14.

“I’m a single late 20-something gal and I’m on the dating scene and between finding the perfect rom-com boyfriend and swiping through all dating apps, I have found that living with psoriasis and dating is yet another added layer that comes with the condition. When do you tell your date? What will they say? How will they react? As if the first date wasn’t awkward enough!

“In all truth, bringing it up and hitting preconceptions out of the park has been my go-to - no it’s not contagious, not an STD, yes it can hurt, especially during the friction that can come with sex.

“Sometimes I don’t feel sexy, sometimes I’m embarrassed, but overall I’m comfortable in my skin and you should be to if you’re dating me. Living with psoriasis absolutely flips the societal vision of sex on its head - your skin can flake and be all over the sheets, you can bleed, your skin isn’t smooth like every poster girl we see, it can get messy. But hey, this is real life, this is reality, and this is passion with your psoriasis.

“So my advice would be never be afraid to be you living with psoriasis. If anyone rejects you for living with it, be it dating or a one night stand, then they aren’t worth it and have far bigger issues than psoriasis. Be empowered by your condition, #getyourskinout and start a conversation around living with psoriasis and definitely keep having sex.





“It affects every part of life.”

Michael, 44, began suffering with psoriasis aged 14.

“It’s restrictions go beyond the purely physical and affect psychological, sociological, emotional aspects of life; eg. Issues around self-esteem and interaction.

“It can affect what you wear, how you carry yourself before others, responding to comments, feeling unable to go swimming publicly, intimacy, effects of constant itch and pain, awareness of stares, brushing off dandruff, hoovering up skin, embarrassment of giving lifts in car with shed skin. I could go on.”



“It can be a sign of a deeper problem.”

Jane Austin, 52, began experiencing psoriasis at the age of 25.

“My dad died when I was 24. We didn’t know each other well - he was largely absent in my childhood - but I guess his ‘absence’ was as significant as if he’d been an involved parent. A year after his death I suffered from depression and that’s when my psoriasis began.

“Over the last 20-odd years, it’s been my companion, sometimes being more vocal or obvious than I would like, but I have learnt to realise that its presence is a clanging bell that something is upsetting me and I need to take stock. Stop drinking red wine for a while, get some early nights, remove myself from the company of people that drain me.

“What I have learnt from my psoriasis is to try to welcome it and use it on my body as a barometer for how I’m living my life. I would ask people not to stare or point at my hand, elbows and knees on public transport, don’t move your children away from me. Don’t loudly ask ‘Whassat?’ You’re not a fucking moron, it’s some dead skin, there because I’m temporarily feeling vulnerable, lost or bereft.

“To go back to the bereavement point: in the old days, mourners would wear a black armband for a year just to let people know that they were a bit sad, shaky and not quite in the game. Please treat my psoriasis like a black band and show consideration.”",World Psoriasis Day: This Is What People With Psoriasis Want You To Know,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/world-psoriasis-day-this-is-what-people-with-psoriasis-want-you-to-know_uk_59f34039e4b077d8dfc9305b

Liebe Frau Merkel,

jetzt regieren Sie also wohl weiter, und das auch noch mit einer starken AfD und FDP im Bundestag. Schlimmer hätte es für uns Alleinerziehende kaum kommen können.

Dass Sie an der Macht bleiben werden, ist nicht überraschend. Und trotzdem tue ich mich schwer, mich damit abzufinden. Denn vier weitere Jahre CDU an der Regierung bedeuten, eine Frau als Kanzlerin hin oder her, dass wir Alleinerziehenden weiterhin als Randgruppe bedauerlicher Einzelfälle angesehen werden.

Wobei das mit dem Bedauern auf wackeligen Füßen steht: Den Quatsch mit dem selbstverschuldeten Lebensmodell, den die AfD verzapft, gehen Sie zwar so offen nicht mit. Bei der CDU herrscht Barmherzigkeit, wir können uns etwas Mitleid abholen - und dann sollen wir Alleinerziehenden aber gefälligst auch ruhig sein.

Wir wuppen das, was in Familien zwei Erwachsene tun, ganz alleine

Aber wenn ich genau hingucke, dann ist das Bild, das die AfD von Alleinerziehenden zeichnet, gar nicht so weit entfernt von dem, das ich bei Ihnen in der Partei finde.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 15 Dinge, die eine Alleinerziehende dir sagen will

Denn für die tiefgläubigen Katholiken, und mit denen ist die CDU ja schon vom Parteinamen her im Pakt, ist eine Alleinerziehende eine Frau, die mit einem Bein in der Hölle steht. Schon die Scheidung ist verpönt, die Ehe ein Sakrileg – und folgerichtig stellen Sie und Ihre Partei die Ehe über alles, sogar über Kinder.

Sie sehen uns nicht – und wenn, dann als gescheiterte Existenzen, als Mütter zweiter Klasse, die mit durchgefüttert werden, weil es der christliche Gedanke gebietet. Aber Sympathien, oder gar Hochachtung für uns, das haben Sie nicht.

Dabei sind wir die heimlichen Leistungsträgerinnen in diesem Land! Ja, das meine ich ganz ernst. Wir wuppen das, was in Familien zwei Erwachsene tun, ganz alleine, oft noch unter Anfeindungen von missgünstigen Mitmenschen, die nur darauf warten, dass bei uns irgendwas schiefgeht, und sei es nur der vergessene Kuchen zum Klassenfest.

Wir sind Mütter mit Makeln

""Die ist alleinerziehend, die packt das nicht!“, tuscheln die Leute dann oder schauen einfach tadelnd. Oder sie schicken uns gleich das Jugendamt auf den Hals, weil die Kinder schon wieder krank sind oder Mama nach der Arbeit erst um 17 Uhr nach Hause kommt, und das Grundschulkind seit dem Mittagessen alleine Zuhause ist.

All dies ist Alltag für alleinerziehende Mütter. ""Wenn euch Alleinerziehenden nicht die Männer weglaufen würden, dann müsste ich jetzt nicht die Gewerbesteuer erhöhen, um Kitaplätze zu schaffen"", sagte allen Ernstes ein CDU-Bürgermeister zu einer Leserin von mir.

Er sagte es nicht öffentlich, so wie derjenige ältere Herr aus der CDU, der mir deutlich zu verstehen gab, dass ich als Alleinerziehende per se versagt habe, weil die Ehe um jeden Preis zu erhalten sei, und ich als Frau, die ihren Mann verließ, gesündigt hätte.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Die etablierte Politik vernachlässigt Familien und Alleinerziehende - und die AfD nutzt das gezielt für sich aus

Hätte er mich verlassen, dann hätte ich übrigens auch versagt, weil ich ihn nicht halten konnte. Alleinerziehende können eigentlich gar nichts richtig machen, wir sind Mütter mit Makeln. Ausgestoßene gewissermaßen, von der Teilhabe ausgeschlossen, auch wegen der Armut, unter der viele von uns trotz Arbeit und guter Bildung leiden.

""Ja, aber wir tun doch auch was für Alleinerziehende! Wir planen den Rechtsanspruch auf einen Hortplatz!"", mögen Sie sagen. Schon – aber das machen Sie, liebe Frau Merkel, für die Wirtschaft. Nicht für die Eltern, und schon gar nicht für Alleinerziehende.

Die meisten sind froh, wenn sie am Ende des Monats noch Geld für Essen haben

Denn im Grunde finden Sie ja, dass alles gut so ist, wie es ist, das ist das Kernstück von wahrem Konservativismus. Das Ehegattensplitting muss bleiben, sagen Sie, das mit der Altersarmut werde schon nicht so schlimm, eine Frauenquote brauche man nicht, und hey, Sie wollen sogar ein Kinderbaugeld zahlen.

Da muss ich allerdings ziemlich bitter lachen – als ob Alleinerziehende das Geld für Wohneigentum hätten. Die meisten sind froh, wenn sie überhaupt am Ende des Monats noch Geld für Essen haben. Aber daran sieht man ja ganz klar, welches Familienbild die Union propagiert: keins, in dem eine Mutter oder ein Vater mit den Kindern alleine lebt.

Dann schon lieber ein homosexuelles Paar mit Kindern. Damit haben sich ja zumindest Teile Ihrer Partei angefreundet. Am besten, ich rate meinen Kindern, schwul oder lesbisch zu werden. Alleinerziehend jedenfalls sollten sie unter Ihrer Regierung nicht sein.

That's why maid of honour Sharilyn Wester decided to go all out when her best friend's photographer asked her to help with the veil toss at her July wedding in Bonnyville, Alta.

In a series of images shared on Facebook, Wester is seen epically photobombing her bestie Rebecca Foster and her husband, James. Naturally, the results were hilarious!

If you're wondering why the bride looks fairly oblivious to her friend's charades compared to her new husband, it's because Foster was in on the prank.

""The groom had no idea what we decided to do, but once we started acting goofy, he played along and was laughing,"" Wester, who lives in St. Paul, Alta., told HuffPost Canada via email.

""We had been outside in the 36 C weather in the sun all day in formal attire for hours, and we figured we could try and perk everyone up and make them laugh.""

Although Wester says her poses were done in the spur of the moment, the 23-year-old noted that the idea for the photobomb was actually conceived years earlier.

""It was based off a photo Rebecca saw that we both decided we had to recreate,"" she explained. ""This was two years before the actual wedding!""

It was so funny. The whole bridal party was cracking up.

In addition to the groom, Bonnyville-based photographer Ashley Hempel was also caught off guard by the maid of honour's antics.

""Sharilyn was like 'Oh we want to do this one photo of me tossing her veil,' and I was like 'Sure, okay,' thinking to myself we had already done a few with my assistant tossing it,"" Hempel said. ""So I posed Becca and James, and then Sharilyn started HER posing and I died. It was so funny. The whole bridal party was cracking up.""

Hempel added that the hilarity of the photo was definitely thanks to the two best friends and their silly sense of humour.

""They are hilarious,"" she said of Foster and Wester. ""They have each other's backs — constantly striking poses and goofing off even during the getting ready photos.""

""I think they're the type of friends who will be 75 at an old folks' home pantsing the orderlies,"" she added with a laugh.

Clearly Foster and Wester are serious BFF goals.

But in keeping with its role as the most ardent proponent of universal health care in Canadian history, the NDP got its fair share of the limelight.
And aside from Sanders, Singh was clearly a crowd favorite, drawing raucous applause when he entered the room and took his seat in the front row.","TORONTO ― The leader of Canada’s most left-wing political party vowed to stand up to President Donald Trump if elected prime minister and called on current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to do the same.

“I believe that you have to stand up to a bully. You can’t back down from a bully ― that’s what they want you to do,” Jagmeet Singh, the recently elected leader of the National Democratic Party told HuffPost following Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ speech on health care at the University of Toronto.

Asked whether he believes that Prime Minister Trudeau, leader of the center-left Liberal Party, has done an adequate job standing up to Trump, Singh said, “I don’t think so.”

“He could be stronger. He could stand up,” Singh said.

Trudeau has developed a close working relationship with the U.S. president since Trump took office in January, notwithstanding their major disagreements on issues like trade and immigrant rights. Trump appeared to get along well with Trudeau during the prime minister’s first visit to Washington, D.C., under the new presidency in February. Trudeau returned for renegotiation talks earlier this month among the U.S., Canada and Mexico on the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trudeau praised Trump in June as someone who “knows how to interact socially on a very effective level.”

“I’ve always found that whenever he has made an engagement to me or a commitment to me on the phone or in person, he has followed through on that,” Trudeau said. “And that’s someone you can work with.”

Andrew Francis Wallace/Getty Images Jagmeet Singh celebrates his win as leader of the New Democratic Party on Oct. 1. 2017.

Singh was elected head of the New Democratic Party, or NDP, Canada’s most left-wing major party, on Oct. 1. If Singh remains leader of his party in two years, he will run for prime minister against Trudeau and the Conservative Party leader, a post currently held by Andrew Scheer. The next national elections are on Oct. 21, 2019.

Singh, a 38-year-old criminal defense attorney and member of Ontario’s provincial parliament, rose to international fame thanks to a viral video capturing him patiently reasoning with a xenophobic heckler at a town hall meeting.

In September, Singh, who is a practicing Sikh, was holding one of his “JagmMeet and Greet” community forums in the Toronto suburb of Brampton when a woman began interrupting the event with anti-Muslim vitriol directed at Singh. (Practicing Sikh men, who typically wear turbans and grow large beards, are often subject to Islamophobic hate crimes and other prejudice based on the uninformed perception that they are Muslim.)

Singh encouraged the audience to chant “love and courage” to drown out her yells.

“We welcome you. We love you. We support you, and we love you,” he told the woman.

Even as he declared Sunday that he would adopt a confrontational stance toward Trump as prime minister, Singh advised Americans concerned about rising xenophobia and other forms of bias under Trump’s leadership to emulate the high-road approach he modeled at the town hall.

“We all need love and courage to tackle the issues of the day, to keep that love in your heart, that we’re all connected, we’re all in this together, and it requires courage for us to demand better, dream bigger and fight for a better world,” he told HuffPost. “That love and courage is a big part of why I do what I do, and I think that will motivate other people as well.”

Sen. Sanders arrived in Toronto on Saturday for a two-day tour of Canada’s publicly financed health care system. The trip was aimed at learning about its successes and challenges as he continues his push for the United States to adopt a similar system. On Saturday, Sanders visited several hospitals in downtown Toronto alongside Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne of the Liberal Party, several American medical professionals and Canadian physicians and health care advocates.

Wynne introduced Sanders on Sunday ahead of his speech to an audience of over 1,000 people, most of them University of Toronto students.

But in keeping with its role as the most ardent proponent of universal health care in Canadian history, the NDP got its fair share of the limelight.

In his speech, Sanders sang the praises of Tommy Douglas, who was the first leader of the NDP and is credited as the forefather of Canada’s national health care system. The party is now fighting for universal coverage of pharmaceutical drugs, which the government does not guarantee across the board, as well as dental care, which is entirely private. (Wynne said she also supports universal pharmaceutical coverage, and has overseen the expansion of Ontario’s health insurance program to cover pharmaceutical drugs for all provincial residents from birth through age 24, which will take effect in January.)

And aside from Sanders, Singh was clearly a crowd favorite, drawing raucous applause when he entered the room and took his seat in the front row.

Speaking after Sanders, Ed Broadbent, who led the NDP from 1975 to 1989, gave Singh a shout-out.

A bill the NDP introduced in parliament that would provide universal pharmaceutical coverage, Broadbent noted, “didn’t pass, but I can tell you the struggle for it will continue.”

“And I also want you to know that it pleases me a lot that the man who will lead that battle is Jagmeet Singh,” he added.

The applause at the mention of Singh’s name was so loud that he stood up and waved to acknowledge the ovation.

Singh met with Sanders on Sunday morning prior to his speech, a conversation Singh described as “awesome.” He asked Sanders what motivated him to fight so hard for universal health care.",Progressive Canadian Leader: Justin Trudeau Should ‘Stand Up’ To Donald Trump,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jagmeet-singh-justin-trudeau-should-stand-up-to-donald-trump_us_59f63f4fe4b07fdc5fbecde8

Un acte pour la bonne cause

Sa tenue l'atteste (un t-shirt noir flanqué d'une tête de mort), tout comme les objets qu'il tient dans ses mains, en l'occurrence le gentil cow-boy Woody et une loupe. Les fans du film d'animation auront sans doute compris la référence à la célèbre séquence durant laquelle le cruel garçon torture le pauvre jouet.

Présent dans les épisodes 1 et 3 de ""Toy Story"", Sid Philipps est l'auteur de maltraitances et autres tortures sur ses jouets. La ressemblance (physique) avec Will Poulter est frappante et l'acteur a donc décidé de s'en inspirer pour faire passer un message limpide.

""En plus de rire à mes dépens, je voulais essayer d'attirer l'attention pour une cause pour laquelle je suis ambassadeur!

Will Poulter évoque directement l'organisme de bienfaisance britannique fondé en 2011, ""l'Anti-Bullying Pro"" dont la mission est de former les jeunes à devenir des ambassadeurs ""anti-harcèlement"" dans les écoles. Ces derniers peuvent alors promouvoir une culture anti-intimidation célébrant la tolérance et le respect des autres. En 2013, l'association a reçu des fonds provenant du Ministère de l'Éducation, signe de son caractère institutionnel.

A growing number of analysts are predicting the loonie is in for a rough few months.

Among the most prominent voices calling for a lower Canadian dollar is CIBC, which in a report issued Friday suggested that betting against the loonie is a good idea these days.

""We suggest that the Canadian dollar is still mispriced,"" the bank's deputy chief economist, Benjamin Tal, wrote. ""Too many factors are pointing in unison to one direction — a lower loonie.""

Tal predicts that the loonie will fall to around 75 cents U.S. in the first few months of 2018. It was trading at 77.8 cents U.S. on Monday morning, already down from highs above 82 cents in September.

Watch: How NAFTA talks are impacting the loonie and Mexican peso

Tal argued that U.S. President Donald Trump's pick for a new Federal Reserve chair will likely be more aggressive than their predecessor, Janet Yellen, so interest rates are likely to rise faster in the U.S. than Canada, driving up the U.S. dollar against the loonie.

He noted that, when it comes to policy decisions from the Trump administration, ""the current level of expectation ... is basically zero.""

So if Trump and congressional Republicans manage to pass a tax reform package, that ""could lead to a notable market reaction ... putting downward pressure on our currency,"" Tal wrote in a report titled ""Short the Loonie.""

Other analysts are making similar arguments. Kurt Reiman of global investment management firm BlackRock noted that a failure of NAFTA renegotiations could also push the loonie lower, as so far, investors haven't priced in that risk.

""Since NAFTA re-negotiations began, the loonie has risen one per cent while the Mexican peso weakened seven per cent. The Canadian dollar arguably has more room to reflect concerns of a bleak NAFTA outcome,"" he wrote.

Reiman also noted that Canadians have accumulated one of the largest household debt burdens in the developed world, so he expects the Bank of Canada to move cautiously in raising interest rates in the coming months. That, again, will put downward pressure on the loonie.

CIBC's Tal agrees. He notes that the markets have priced in a 28-per-cent chance of the Bank of Canada raising interest rates in December.

""That's 28 per cent too high,"" Tal wrote.

Zuspruch kam aus der Wirtschaft, Kritik von der SPD

Kaum ist die große Koalition Geschichte, wird eines ihrer Rentenprojekte zerpflückt: die Rente mit 63.

CDU-Präsidiumsmitglied Jens Spahn verlangte in der ""Rheinischen Post"" ihre Abschaffung. Diese ""Form der Frühverrentung"" sollte auslaufen und das Geld lieber in die Renten von Witwen und Erwerbsgeminderten investiert werden, argumentierte er. ""Die Rente mit 63 für langjährig Versicherte wird vor allem von männlichen Facharbeitern genutzt, die wir eigentlich noch brauchen.""

IW-Direktor ist für die Abschaffung

Der Direktor des arbeitgebernahen Instituts der deutschen Wirtschaft (IW) Köln, Michael Hüther, sagte der ""Welt"", die Rente mit 63 müsse ""rückabgewickelt"" werden. Mehr als 200.000 Arbeitskräfte hätten deswegen schon zu arbeiten aufgehört – alles gut verdienende Menschen mit mittlerer und höherer Bildung.

""Wenn ich Grüne und FDP wäre, würde ich die Union da vor mir hertreiben"", sagte Hüther mit Blick auf die Jamaika-Sondierungen. Zudem müsse man darüber nachdenken, ab 2029 das Renteneintrittsalter auch über 67 Jahre hinaus zu erhöhen.

Nach Angaben der Deutschen Rentenversicherung Bund haben bis Ende August 160.000 Versicherte einen Antrag auf abschlagsfreie Rente mit 63 gestellt. Im Vorjahreszeitraum waren es noch 165.000.

Kritik von der SPD

Wer mindestens 45 Jahre in die Rentenversicherung eingezahlt hat, kann seit Juli 2014 ab 63 Jahren ohne Abschlag in Rente gehen. Allerdings wird diese Altersgrenze seitdem pro Jahr um zwei Monate angehoben, so dass die Jahrgänge ab 1964 erst mit 65 nach 45 Jahren abschlagsfrei in Renten gehen können. Die ""Rente mit 63"" ist insofern etwas missverständlich.

Die frühere Bundesfamilienministerin Manuela Schwesig (SPD) wies den Vorstoß Spahns zurück. ""Das zeigt, wie die CDU heute tickt. Da ist mehr soziale Kälte als soziale Verantwortung zu spüren"", sagte sie dem SWR.

Das Vorstandsmitglied des Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (DGB), Annelie Buntenbach, hielt Spahn entgegen: ""Wer die Rente mit 63 zurückdrehen will, ignoriert schlicht die Lebenswirklichkeit vieler Menschen. Wir brauchen nicht weniger Möglichkeiten für Beschäftigte, vor dem 67. Lebensjahr in Rente gehen zu können, sondern mehr."" Viele erreichten heute schon den regulären Rentenbeginn nicht.

Der Wirtschaftsrat der CDU sieht in einem Jamaika-Bündnis die große Chance, das SPD-Projekt der Rente mit 63 zu beerdigen, und unterstützt den Vorstoß Spahns.

Die Mütterrente

Die CSU wollte in den Jamaika-Sondierungen auch eine weitere Erhöhung der Mütterrente fordern. Dabei geht es um Mütter, deren Kinder vor 1992 geboren wurden. Sie sollen einen Rentenpunkt mehr bekommen und damit genauso viel wie Mütter, deren Kinder nach diesem Datum geboren wurden. Ein Rentenpunkt für diese Frauen kostet zwischen sechs und sieben Milliarden Euro.

Die Grünen-Fraktionsvorsitzende Katrin Göring-Eckardt sagte im ARD-""Morgenmagazin"": ""Für mich ist das Entscheidende, dass wir keine Altersarmut mehr haben."" Die Mütterrente sei dafür nicht das richtige Instrument. Besser wäre eine ""Garantierente"". Wer lange gearbeitet habe, solle mehr haben als die Grundsicherung.

Die Präsidentin des Sozialverbands VdK, Ulrike Mascher, forderte die vollständige Angleichung der Mütterrente sowie eine Stabilisierung des Rentenniveaus und dessen Anhebung auf 50 Prozent.

Brandan Odums Brandan Odums spray-paints a wall for ""Exhibit Be"" in 2014.","For the past four years, Brandan “BMike” Odums has been transforming blighted spaces in New Orleans’ poor neighborhoods through powerful art.

Odums spray-paints larger-than-life murals of African-American icons like Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman and Martin Luther King Jr. at abandoned sites, some of which have been falling apart since Hurricane Katrina.

The New Orleans native aims to criticize how the city neglected under-resourced neighborhoods after the 2005 natural disaster ― but also wants to celebrate the residents of these mostly-black neighborhoods and the pride and beauty of their communities.

“Think about the spaces, they were in black, poor communities,” Odums told HuffPost. “[The art is] just to feel like you matter and you have value, so people can see themselves reflected in this portrait of Mohammed Ali or Maya Angelou.”

“Seeing a 12-foot painting of a person of color, it immediately asks a question of why it’s this large: It must be valuable,” he added.

“Project Be”

He and other artists covered the buildings’ decaying walls with enormous murals of famed civil rights figures, from the Black Panthers to Malcolm X to Coretta Scott King.

“New Orleans is a magical city, it’s amazing ― the resilience of the people has always surfaced,” Odums said. “My goal is to speak to issues happening in the community. We have to create the change we want to see.”

But the Housing Authority of New Orleans boarded up the property after reportedly deeming it unsafe for public visitors. So Odums moved on to a vacant apartment complex in the Algiers neighborhood, which was full of blighted properties after Katrina.

“Exhibit Be”

There, Odums ran into some luck: Bill Thomason, a director at the RDLN Foundation, a small nonprofit dedicated to charitable building projects that owned the property, came across Odums’ art in the space and loved it.

Rather than kick him out, he told Odums to keep going. So in 2014, Odums brought together dozens of artists to contribute their talents and launch “Exhibit Be,” a multistory art show celebrating black history and culture with images of Harriet Tubman and quotes like “You are your ancestors’ wildest dreams.”

“The goal of that space was to be intentional about where that property stood, to reflect the reality of living in a poorly managed housing unit that ended up being an abandoned space,” Odums told HuffPost. “I wanted [people] to understand they would not have been standing on that spot without that art, they would have been too afraid of going down the street.”

When “Exhibit Be” opened to the public in 2014, it quickly became a local success, attracting thousands of visitors, national media coverage and school trips to the space.

“It was a crazy story of how we turned lemon into lemonade,” Odums told HuffPost. “It was a space so many people avoided, and now there was a line. Erykah Badu came to the block party.”

Thomason said it was “amazing” to watch thousands of people coming to see the art.

“Especially in these times, with all this turmoil, you had people coming to visit, having conversations together ― black, white, all creeds, colors, religions ― who would just sit there, enjoying the artwork,” Thomason told HuffPost.

“Studio Be”

Odums’ first solo show, “Studio Be,” which kicked off in early 2016 and is currently on view in a warehouse in New Orleans’ Bywater neighborhood, is the first “Be” project to start up entirely legally.

In “Studio Be,” Odums’ large-scale murals reflect social justice issues like civil rights and police brutality. One portrait series features unarmed black men killed by police: Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Oscar Grant.

Odums says he makes a point of hosting school tours there to teach kids about lesser-known black history figures, such as Fred Hampton, a leader of the Black Panthers who was assassinated at age 21.

“It’s full circle, from starting painting in the streets without permission to coming to this space. Think about the power of art,” Odums said. “It’s about me speaking as a young black man from New Orleans, and speaking truth to that existence ― the hope, the pain, the beauty.”

His face hidden by a headdress, a man who identified himself as Lushsux said against the backdrop of a cement section of the Israeli wall in Bethlehem that he hoped his painting would draw attention to Palestinians stuck in ""an indoor prison"".

The Bethlehem wall has become a showcase of protest art voicing Palestinians' fears that Israel's West Bank fence-and-concrete barrier is a land grab that may deny them a state. Israelis deem the project a bulwark against Palestinian attack.

""The wall is a message in itself,"" the man, who said he painted the mural overnight, told Reuters. ""I don't need to write 'Free Palestine' or something like that, something really direct ... that people will ignore.

""I just paint what I usually paint and maybe people will start looking at the background and looking at the razor wire and looking at people stuck in here, and maybe that'll work better,"" he said in Australian-accented English.

Murals on the barrier believed to be the work of Lushsux include one showing Trump kissing an Israeli watchtower and another depicting him placing his hand on the barrier and thinking about building a similar wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

This isn't the first politically-charged Lushsux work to make headlines.



In August last year the artist depicted then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a bikini on the wall of a shop in Footscray, Melbourne. When the Maribyrnong council determined that the image was too offensive, Lushsux changed the illustration to show Clinton in a niqab.

Katie Nicholl, a journalist and royal expert based in the U.K., reveals in the doc that the prince was a huge fan of Markle, 36, in the TV series ""Suits,"" in which she plays paralegal Rachel Zane.

According to Nicholl, Harry, 33, had told friends that Markle was his ""ideal woman"" after watching the series, which is now in its seventh season.

He was single at the time, so she said, 'Harry, who's your ideal girl?' And he said 'Meghan Markle from 'Suits.'

""He had a crush on Rachel Zane two years before he met Meghan and the reason I know is because I was having drinks with one of his friends,"" Nicholl says in the documentary.

""She [Harry's friend] told me she'd been on a night out with Prince Harry. He was single at the time, so she said, 'Harry, who's your ideal girl?' And he said 'Meghan Markle from 'Suits.'""

Cue our reaction:

The couple, who are said to be nearing an engagement, finally met in the summer of 2016, when Harry asked their mutual friend Markus Anderson, a consultant for Soho House, a private social club, to set up an introduction in London.

""He asked Markus if he could set up, not a date, but an opportunity for them to meet and that happened in one of the private rooms of Soho House,"" recounts Nicholl.

""There were about seven or eight of them altogether and it was a perfect opportunity for Harry and Meghan to come together in a really informal environment and actually talk.""

Since that encounter, the couple have been going full-speed ahead with their relationship, from making their first public appearance together as a couple at the Invictus Games in Toronto this past September (where they engaged in a ton of PDA) to Markle's supposed introduction to the Queen just recently.

The couple is also reportedly looking for a home together in London, with insiders saying that Markle will be moving to the bustling city full-time after she's wrapped up ""Suits.""

According to Vanity Fair, Markle has already met Harry's dad, Prince Charles, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Prince William.

And while an engagement is practically inevitable, a wedding most likely won't happen until later in 2018 because of certain other royal events that are happening, including the arrival of William and Kate Middleton's third child, which is due in April.

""William and Kate are expecting their third baby mid April, and Harry won't want to overshadow the birth of another prince or princess, and, of course, the Duchess will need some time to recover before she is at such a high-profile event. The most likely date is early summer 2018, which neatly ties in with Harry and Meghan's second anniversary,"" a source told Vanity Fair.

What Is A Staph Infection?
Approximately one to two percent of people have an antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria living on them.
In 2015, there were more than 2,300 cases of severe MRSA infections in Australia.
At the turn of the century, nine out of 10 antibiotic-resistant staph infections were caught in hospitals.","The golden staph 'superbug' once synonymous with hospitals and the elderly is now primarily affecting young people in the community, not medical institutions -- and medical researchers believe the overuse of antibiotics is likely to blame.

Golden staph, or 'Staphylococcus aureus', usually occurs when a cut or break in the skin becomes infected, causing redness, swelling, irritation or a boil.

""What happens for most people is they get a cut or they get a boil and that's a staph infection, an accumulation of puss -- when you get red, hot and get a bit of a fever around it,"" explained research author Dr Jason Agostino from the Australian National University.

""For most people it stays there only on the skin either as cellulitis or a boil. But for some people it gets into the blood stream.""

What Is A Staph Infection? Staph is a common bacterium, 'Staphylococcus aureus', which lives on the skin and in the noses of around one in five Australians. Approximately one to two percent of people have an antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria living on them. Infections usually occur due to cuts, grazes or following medical procedures and are generally treatable with antibiotics, but if the bacteria enters the bloodstream it can cause a life-threatening infection. Antibiotic-resistant staph, also called MRSA, is harder to treat and more likely to prove deadly. In 2015, there were more than 2,300 cases of severe MRSA infections in Australia. One in five of those infected will die within 30 days.

Skin infections generally aren't serious and can be treated with antibiotics but if the staph bacteria enters the bloodstream, it causes a deadly infection that will kill more than one in five of its victims within 30 days.

Staph bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, known as MRSA, are harder to treat and more likely to be deadly than their antibiotic-susceptible counterparts.

At the turn of the century, nine out of 10 antibiotic-resistant staph infections were caught in hospitals.

Improved hand hygiene practices by doctors and nurses and increased screening rates for staph bacteria have seen these rates drop, but the number of people infected outside of hospitals is steadily climbing.

Between 2008 and 2014, the majority of MRSA cases (56.9 percent) were contracted by people who haven't been to hospital in the past year, a study of almost 40,000 people in northeastern NSW has found.

Some patients will have to have limbs amputated to stem the spread of disease.

Worryingly, its putting teenagers and young people at risk.

The average age of those who catch the bug outside of hospitals was just 26 years (compared to 65 years old inside hospitals) and teenagers aged 10-19 were the single most infected group.

Overuse of antibiotics is largely to blame, Dr Agostino told HuffPost Australia.

Australian GPs prescribe antibiotics at up to nine times the recommended rate, with around five million Aussies taking them unnecessarily each year.

""Australia prescribes more than double the amount of antibiotics than some countries in Europe and it's in these environment that drug-resistant bugs such as staph develop,"" Dr Agostino said.

The more antibiotics are being used in any one region, the more a process of natural selection will favour the staph bugs resistance to those antibiotics, making them more likely to thrive and spread, he explained.

""So the more we can bring that rate down, the less beneficial it is for bugs to develop this antibiotic resistance.""

Improved hygiene practices has helped to reduce the rates of infection within hospitals.

Young people were more likely to contract staph infections because they had more skin-to-skin contact than other age groups and were frequently cut and grazed during sports and other activities.

Indigenous Australians and those in nursing homes are also high-risk groups, according to the research published on Monday in the Medical Journal of Australia.

As well as reducing antibiotic use, simple hygiene practices such as regular hand washing and keeping cuts and grazes covered until they're healed can counter the spread of the bug, Dr Agostino said.",Antibiotic Overuse Means Golden Staph 'Superbug' Is Now More Common Outside Of Hospitals Than In,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/29/antibiotic-overuse-means-golden-staph-superbug-is-now-more-common-outside-of-hospitals-than-in_a_23260081/

Meanwhile a survey conducted by Mind earlier this year found 43% of women have taken time off for poor mental health at some point in their career, compared with just 29% of men.

The findings present a sharp contrast to previous audits on masculinity, many of which suggested men were not prioritising their mental health, or perhaps didn’t know how to.

In comparison, just 32.1% of men in the same age group said they believe their physical health is “very important”.

The youngest men involved in the survey were found to place the most importance on mental health, with a total of 46.2% of men aged 18-29 saying they consider mental health to be “very important”.

A new masculinity audit shows men now view their mental health as more important than their physical health, regardless of their age.

Men are three times more likely to die from suicide than women in UK, but a new report suggests education on suicide prevention and mental health is starting to pay off.

Countless campaigns have sought to raise mental health awareness in recent years, with famous faces from the royal family to Freddie Flintoff getting involved.

While nationwide suicide rates are falling overall, men aged between 40 and 44 continue to have the highest suicide rate in the UK.

However, the masculinity audit of more than 2,000 men, conducted by researchers at the University College London and co-authored by journalist Martin Daubney, indicates a hopeful future for this age group.

Almost half (45.9%) of men aged 40-49 consider their mental health to be “very important” compared to 35.6% who would say the same about their physical health.

Commenting on the findings, Craig Butler, a 24-year-old who writes about his own experiences of depression, said he thinks mental health is “equally important” to physical health.

“For me, my mental health directly impacts my physical health. When my mental health isn’t as good as it could be I tend to look after myself less, which then has a collateral effect on my physical health,” he told HuffPost UK.

“Conversely, having poor physical health can also impact mental health because of demanding societal expectations on how I should look.”

Mental health campaigner and vlogger Joshua Hewitt, 19, agreed that “a balance of both is great” when looking after your physical and mental health.

“The two really do help each other out, with positive mental health putting you in a happier place to focus on your physical health too,” he told HuffPost UK.

Hewitt said in his experience, men are starting to be more open with one another about their mental health.

“It’s so great because we can all help each other and a lot of us can relate. It’s thankfully ending the stigma,” he said.

However, Butler said now is not the time to rest on our laurels, as a culture of silence still surrounds mental health.

“I think it’s changing. I don’t think it’s changing quickly enough and there’s still far too much taboo in the work place that makes it difficult, but in general, I think men are slowly becoming more open about it which is so important,” he said.

The men surveyed were also asked about the core values they aspired to in their professional, personal and private lives.

Attaining the perfect body was the least desired of all core values, with only 7.42% ranking it as very important.

Instead, top of the list of core values were selfless qualities such as reliability and dependability, with 97% of men saying these were moderately to very important to them.

The survey also identified what makes men happiest in life, which the researchers said could be used within strategies to improve mental health.

Among men who were found to be above average in positivity, 78% said they are satisfied with their work, making a rewarding job by far the strongest predictor of positive state of mind.

Having a strong long-term relationship was also found to make men happier than being single.

The researchers said the findings counteract the image of men sometimes presented by the media, in which men are presented as wanting to be single, carefree bachelors.

“Our findings counter the fashionably negative view of men and masculinity as being somewhat tainted by toxicity,” the report reads.

“This distorted view probably impacts how men are treated and how men feel about themselves. A more rounded view of men is needed.”

In a statement Dr John Barry of UCL Department of Psychology, who led the research, added: “There has been a very welcome increase in focus recently on male-specific issues such as the appallingly high male suicide rate and the

underachievement of boys and young men in education.

“The findings of this survey provide important insights into what men need to live their lives in a positive way and how they should be represented. The findings should be of enormous interest to policy-makers as they seek improved strategies to address these pressing social problems.”

Not a good start Kevin - especially as Rapp has discussed the incident with friends and family over the years.
As the publisher of lesbian title DIVA and LGBT+ news site OutNews Global, I can confirm that Spacey's sexuality has been an open secret for years.
Spacey, Weinstein and those who will follow put the parents of aspiring performers in a quandary.
Instead, he has issued an apology so feeble it hardly counts as an apology, and has succeeded in conflating child abuse with being gay.","Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp has alleged that when he was just 14, more than 30 years ago, he was sexually harassed by Hollywood A-lister Kevin Spacey.

Spacey responded swiftly, saying ""if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour."" He then goes on to confirm that he is now ""living as a gay man.""

Let us not examine too closely the details of the alleged assault, which involved Spacey carrying Rapp on to a bed and then lying on top of him, but instead focus on what is so wrong with Spacey's statement, a form of words which bears only a passing resemblance to an apology.

Spacey claims that he does not remember the incident and here we must give him the benefit of the doubt, although failure to recall assaulting a child does seem odd for someone whose job involves remembering lines. Yet, by using the phrase 'if I did behave...' implies that the incident may not have happened, introducing the possibility that his accuser may be lying. Not a good start Kevin - especially as Rapp has discussed the incident with friends and family over the years. You've managed to make the story about yourself, with no more than a passing nod to the pain caused to Anthony Rapp.

We then come to the first excuse, Spacey's self-confessed 'drunken behaviour'. I don't know about you, but many people I know sometimes get drunk. I have to admit that even I have occasionally had one too many at a party. And, yes, I accept that, when drunk, we sometimes say and do stupid things. But sexually assaulting a minor is not something that can be excused by too many G&Ts, and describing his own behaviour as 'inappropriate' is unacceptably dismissive. 'Inappropriate drunken behaviour', Mr Spacey, doesn't begin to cover it.

Sadly, in the age of Weinstein and those who, inevitably, will follow, the fact of the alleged assault is no surprise to me. I have no doubt that allegations against Weinstein, and now Spacey, represent the tip of the iceberg. What is especially galling is Spacey's implication that being 'in the closet' somehow contributed to his behaviour, and that because he is now 'living as a gay man' he is coming to terms with his past and 'examining [his] own behaviour'.

As the publisher of lesbian title DIVA and LGBT+ news site OutNews Global, I can confirm that Spacey's sexuality has been an open secret for years. Choosing when, or if, to come out is a matter for the individual, and it is not for the press to 'out' people, unless we are exposing the hypocrisy of public figures (for example MPs who vote against LGBT equality while gay themselves). But by addressing the allegations and admitting his sexuality at the same time, Spacey has given new life to the age old homophobic trope that male homosexuality and paedophilia are somehow connected. This can only fuel the fires of homophobia which, let's face it, is unhelpful in a world of Trump, the rise of the European far right, and the horrific suicide figures relating to LGBT+ youth. It's bad enough for young people to have to struggle with their sexuality to the detriment of their mental health, but throw in a connection between child abuse and homosexuality, and Spacey is not only guilty of the alleged assault, but of linking a perfectly normal sexual orientation with a predilection to child molestation.

Many people I know have come out in the face of huge adversity, facing many hardships, yet have been true to themselves and faced down whatever difficulties their coming out has presented. For Spacey to acknowledge his sexuality only after it has been exposed reinforces the view that being gay is something to be ashamed about. It is clear to me that Spacey has many things about which to be ashamed, but his sexuality is not one of them.

Spacey, Weinstein and those who will follow put the parents of aspiring performers in a quandary. I have twins, one of which wishes to become an actress. Were my daughter, or anyone else, to follow their dream and wish to seek fame and fortune in Hollywood, they'll be looking to work in an industry where the abuse of power - almost always by rich men - is endemic, and often finds its form in sexual harassment, abuse and rape. As long as people like Kevin Spacey try to excuse their misdeeds as somehow a result of too much alcohol, being in the closet or both, Hollywood remains a place where young men and women either have to risk being abused to succeed, have their careers ruined for refusing sex (as has been alleged in the case of Harvey Weinstein) or have to forget about their career aspirations and do something else instead.

Kevin Spacey is a powerful figure in American movies and on the London stage. He had an opportunity to do the right thing... to apologise unreservedly and to accept what Rapp's allegations. Instead, he has issued an apology so feeble it hardly counts as an apology, and has succeeded in conflating child abuse with being gay.

It's too late for Anthony Rapp, but not too late for Spacey to make amends. I urge him to rethink and to apologise properly.",Kevin Spacey's Coming Out Story Will Go Down In History As The Worst Ever,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-riley/kevin-spacey-statement-_b_18420122.html?1509380984&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Die Magen-Darm-Krankheit gilt als hochansteckend

Daher sollte jeder die Symptome kennen und sein Verhalten anpassen

Der Norovirus breitet sich in Berlin aus: In den vergangenen Wochen haben sich die Zahlen verdoppelt. Mitte Oktober infizierten sich demnach in einer Woche 52 Menschen mit dem hochansteckenden Magen-Darm-Virus, in der Woche zuvor waren es 56.

In den 20 Wochen waren es durchschnittlich nur halb so viele Menschen. Das geht aus den jüngsten Wochenberichten des Landesamts für Gesundheit und Soziales hervor.

Insgesamt liegt die Zahl der für dieses Jahr erfassten Norovirus-Erkrankungen in Berlin bei 2224. Die meisten Meldungen kamen aus Treptow-Köpenick, Pankow und Steglitz-Zehlendorf. Das liegt aber noch unter dem Mittelwert der vergangenen fünf Jahre.

Besonders in Kitas und Altenheimen breitet sich die Krankheit aus

Grund zum Panik ist der Anstieg also nicht - er ist viel mehr typisch für die Jahreszeit. Normalerweise ist bis März mit einer stärkeren Ausbreitung der Krankheit zu rechnen.

Gerade in Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen wie Kindertagesstätten und Altenheime sind dann betroffen. Denn der Norovirus ist extrem anstrengend. Müssen Infizierte erbrechen, gelangen kleinste virushaltige Tröpfen in die Luft - die Krankheit kann sich so beinahe unbemerkt ausbreiten.

Wie ihr eine Norovirus-Infektion erkennt

Die Krankheitssymptome kommen in der Regel plötzlich. Typisch sind starker Durchfall und Erbrechen. Auch klagen die Betroffenen über Übelkeit, Kopfschmerzen und Mattigkeit. Die Norovirus-Symptome dauern bis zu 70 Stunden.

Das Gesundheitsamt Berlin rät zur Bettruhe in der akuten Phase und gut durchgegarten Speisen. Auch wenn es bei den Symptomen vermutlich leicht fällt: Verzichtet möglichst auf Kontakt zu anderen. Und achtet auf eine gute Handdesinfektion.

Wenn die Symptome abgeklungen sind, kann das Virus noch 48 Stunden übertragen werden und weitere sechs bis 14 Tage kann der Patient das Virus ausscheiden, warnt das Gesundheitsamt Berlin.

The Congress and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are locked in a particularly acrimonious debate after former Union minister P. Chidambaram pitched for greater autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir.

The word has clearly spooked the party. A barrage of verbal reprimands poured forth from senior government leaders, including the PM himself, criticizing Chidambaram for raising the unholy 'A' word at an interaction in Rajkot, that they said translated to 'azaadi' or independence.

Modi said Congress is ""speaking the language used in Pakistan"".

""The mother who lost her son and the sister who lost her brother and the children of soldiers who fought to protect Kashmir are asking questions and the Congress shamelessly uses the language of the separatists in Kashmir and the language used in Pakistan.""

He went on to say, as reported by the Indian Express, that, ""Those in power until yesterday have suddenly taken a U-turn and are shamelessly raising their voice for autonomy in Kashmir. Those doing politics over the lives of martyrs cannot be expected to develop India. They have no shame in doing this. The Congress must give an answer for this.""

On cue, BJP's IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya hit Twitter with this comment:

Congress now advocates Azadi for Kashmir! pic.twitter.com/BFUYgTjGKl — Amit Malviya (@malviyamit) October 28, 2017

Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani too called the comment ""disgusting"". ""I think it is quite shocking and disgusting that P Chidambaram today speaks about breaking the Union of India into pieces,"" she said.

""The position the Congress has taken with regard to 'azaadi' or autonomy to be given to Jammu and Kashmir, goes directly contrary to India's national interest,"" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said.

This is what Chidambaram had said: ""The demand in the Kashmir Valley is to respect in letter and spirit Article 370. And that means that they want greater autonomy. My interactions in Jammu and Kashmir led me to the conclusion that when they ask for azadi, most people — I am not saying all — an overwhelming majority want autonomy. Therefore, I think we should seriously examine that question and consider on what areas we can give autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir.""

The fact is, autonomy is a sensitive word for political rulers in Delhi. On social media, siding with those who want self-rule is enough to get one labelled as an anti-national. Stating, like Union minister Jitendra Singh did, that ""there is no such thing as the Kashmir issue"", is living in a state of denial. There is a reason why the central government has appointed a new interlocutor, Dineshwar Sharma, for the troubled state with the mandate for holding ""sustained dialogue"" with stakeholders.

In fact the government's own representative is open to talks with separatists, according to this report.

As a former minister told the Telegraph: ""If autonomy is not to be mentioned, what will the interlocutor discuss, the weather?""

Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted strongly to the bashing Chidambaram took after his comment.

""If seeking autonomy under Indian Constitution is anti-national, then we are ready to be branded anti-national.""

""Yesterday Chidambaram shared his experiences on J&K regarding autonomy but union ministers attacked him and said anyone who talks about autonomy within the country is also anti-national. If seeking autonomy under Indian Constitution is anti-national, then we are ready to be branded anti-national,"" said Abdullah. Article 370 of the constitution gives autonomous status to Jammu and Kashmir.

A Union minister, who was not named, told The Telegraph that ""The autonomy question is embedded in the accession treaty and Article 370, and has survived accords between Indira Gandhi and Sheikh Abdullah and Rajiv Gandhi and Farooq Abdullah. It is settled that devolution of power will happen within the constitutional framework.""

GISHARU, Kenya, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On the edge of Mt. Suswa, an active volcano in southwest Kenya's Rift Valley, Kipas Ole Masiodo checks on volcanic steam rising from cracks in the ground, careful not to let any go to waste.

As prolonged drought dries water reserves across Kenya, harvesting these fleeting wisps of water vapour near Masiodo's home has been a lifeline for his family and community.

""It is clean and safe for drinking,"" the 35-year-old said. ""It is not much, but it is better than travelling to distant sources to look for water.""

Using aluminum sheets and a concrete tank, his community traps the steam, which when cooled can become drinking water. Masiodo said a single steam trap is able to collect at least 200 litres (53 gallons) of water every day – and his village now has 20 of the traps.

The community began building the structures seven years ago, with help from the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD), which donated 8 million Kenyan shillings (about $8,000) to the effort.

The result is that families no longer have to spend large amounts of time searching for scarce water. Previously, Masiodo said, his wife spent several days a week travelling 10 hours a day with the family donkey to fetch water from the distant Ewaso River.

""We are able to use time (otherwise) spent fetching water ... to raise money for school bursaries and build community enterprises like beekeeping,"" the father of five told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

His community got the idea of turning volcanic steam into drinking water in the 1980s, from an overseas visitor.

Although the visitor described the technology needed to harvest water, using iron sheets, it wasn't until 2009 that villagers had the money to put the idea into use.

Now the community has harvesting units, made with aluminum sheets and concrete, as well as collecting tanks ""to store water in large volumes,"" Masiodo said.

He said one unit costs about 200,000 Kenyan shillings (about $ 2,000) to build. Today over a thousand families in his village are using the volcanic steam water, he added.

FINDING AND STORING WATER

As droughts become more frequent in Kenya, many communities are looking for new sources of water and new ways to store it, from building new water ponds to creating sand dams in rivers to hold fresh water in wet sand.

But some water sources have struggled to keep up with demand, particularly during long droughts, said Ole Timoi, a programme manager for Dupoto-e-maa, a community-based organisation that works with pastoralist communities in the Rift Valley.

""Water pans collect and store water when the rain falls,"" said Timoi, whose organisation worked with CAFOD to set up the steam harvesting in Gisharu.

""The stored water can last up to three months before the next rainy season sets in. (But) if the rains fail, the water dries up and the stress cycle continues,"" he said.

Volcanic vapour, in comparison, can provide year-round water, regardless of rainfall – though so far many poor communities lack funding to harness the steam, Timoi said.

Tapping all of the vents around Mt. Suswa would cost more than $100,000, he said.

GEOTHERMAL ENERGY

Those hoping to use volcanic steam for water in Kenya more widely, however, face competition from another user: geothermal energy plants.

Kenya has built three geothermal plants to take advantage of natural steam energy in the area north of Mt. Suswa, giving the country a green and reliable energy source.

But ""marginalised communities need water more than they need electricity,"" insisted Timoi.

Wilson Irungu Nyakera, the Ministry of Planning's principal secretary, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that Kenya's government recognises the need to build more sustainable water infrastructure over the next decade to deal with changing climate conditions.

But budgetary restrictions mean the country will likely need donor funds and private investment to make that happen, he said.

For now, Masiodo is happy his village has reliable water, even in the face of drought. But he hopes more communities will be able to find the funding to put steam harvesting systems in place.

""If there was no water life would be very difficult,"" he noted.

""Las opiniones sobre la economía están fuertemente relacionadas con la satisfacción con la democracia.
Los autócratas envalentonados y los populistas en ascenso han sacudido los supuestos sobre la futura trayectoria de la democracia liberal, tanto en naciones donde aún no ha florecido como en países en los que parecía estar fuertemente arraigada.","El 93% de los mexicanos afirman estar en desacuerdo con el funcionamiento de su sistema democrático, lo cual ubica a México como el país con el mayor desencanto por la democracia entre 36 países evaluados por el Pew Research Center, con sede en Washington.

""Los mexicanos y los libaneses son los más insatisfechos, con al menos nueve de cada diez que dicen que su sistema político actual no funciona bien"", señala el estudio Globally, Broad Support for Representative and Direct Democracy (A nivel global, un amplio apoyo a la democracia representativa y directa).

En todos los 36 países que formulan la pregunta, ""¿qué tan satisfecho está con la forma en que la democracia está funcionando en nuestro país?"", una media global del 46% dice estar ""muy o algo satisfecha"" con la forma en que funciona su democracia, en comparación con el 52% que ""no está muy satisfecho o nada satisfecho"".

En este sentido, México se ubica al fondo del ranking, con 93% de desaprobación ciudadana sobre el actual sistema democrático, con apenas un 6% de satisfacción. La cifra más baja a nivel mundial y a nivel América Latina, región donde existe la mayor desconfianza y desencanto en los sistemas democráticos actuales.

Algo similar ocurre con los niveles de desconfianza que los mexicanos tienen a su gobierno, ya que México registra uno de los peores niveles de confianza a nivel global.

Cuando se le preguntó a la gente ""¿qué tanto confía usted en que su gobierno nacional está haciendo lo correcto por su país?"", apenas el 2% de los mexicanos respondió que ""mucho"" y un 15% respondió que ""algo"". Es decir, que el 83% restante se muestra desconfiado sobre las medidas que realiza el gobierno encabezado por el presidente Enrique Peña Nieto.

""Algunos países se destacan por su falta de confianza. Una mediana global del 14% dice que confían mucho en su gobierno nacional para hacer lo que es correcto para el país. Si bien este porcentaje es bastante bajo, el 5% o menos del público expresa este nivel de confianza en su gobierno nacional en 10 de los 37 países que hicieron la pregunta: España, Chile, Perú, Francia, Corea del Sur, Brasil, México, Líbano, Italia y Grecia"", señala el documento.

El estudio también encontró que en América Latina hay una brecha generacional en los puntos de vista en torno a la democracia directa. ""En Brasil, Chile, México y Venezuela, las personas de entre 18 y 29 años apoyan más que las personas mayores de 50 años la postura de tener ciudadanos y no funcionarios electos, que voten directamente sobre asuntos de gran importancia nacional"", indica el estudio.

Asimismo, la investigación señala que ""los países que se clasifican como más plenamente democráticos y que tienen un mayor porcentaje del público comprometido con la democracia representativa también tienden a ser más ricos"".

De este modo, existe una correlación entre el desencanto de la gente con el gobierno y el mal desempeño de la economía. Por ejemplo, en India, donde la economía ha crecido en promedio un 6.9% desde 2012, el 85% de la gente confía en su gobierno nacional. Mientras tanto, solo el 26% de los italianos tienen confianza en su gobierno, país cuya economía se ha contraído en los últimos cinco años.

""Las opiniones sobre la economía están fuertemente relacionadas con la satisfacción con la democracia. En casi todos los países, las personas que afirman que la economía nacional está funcionando bien, son más propensos a decir que está mal lo que se está haciendo para estar satisfechos con el sistema político"", señala el Pew Center.

En este sentido, México se ubica en la parte baja de la gráfica, donde un crecimiento económico menor al 3% anual en lo que va del sexenio de Peña está correlacionado con una opinión favorable del gobierno menor al 20% de la población.

""Una ansiedad cada vez mayor sobre el futuro de la democracia en todo el mundo se ha extendido en los últimos años. Los autócratas envalentonados y los populistas en ascenso han sacudido los supuestos sobre la futura trayectoria de la democracia liberal, tanto en naciones donde aún no ha florecido como en países en los que parecía estar fuertemente arraigada. Los estudiosos han documentado una recesión democrática mundial y algunos ahora advierten que incluso las democracias consolidadas establecidas desde hace mucho tiempo podrían perder su compromiso con la libertad y caer hacia una política más autoritaria"", concluye el estudio.

Schwarz, aromatisch und auch durchaus gesund - Kaffee ist für manchen nicht ohne Grund das liebste Getränk: Nach einer Studie eines Kaffeerösters mit Brand Eins Wissen und Statista hat der Durchschnittsdeutsche vergangenes Jahr 162 Liter getrunken.

Kenner wissen, es kommt dabei vor allen auf die Bohnen an. Weltweit gibt es 40 Sorten. Die Unterschiede zeigen bereits die zwei bekanntesten Sorten:

Robusta gilt als stark koffeinhaltig. Zusammen mit einem hohen Gehalt von Chlorogensäure macht diese Sorte für manchen schwer verträglich. Ganz anders die Arabica-Bohne. Diesen Kaffee definieren Kenner als süßlich, klar, leicht und rund.

""España, Una, Grande, Libre!"", a tweeté le fondateur du Front national, reprenant la devise instaurée par le général Franco en 1936.

Une façon -très provocatrice- de défendre l'unité nationale espagnole qui choque outre-Pyrénées, comme le montre la photo publiée en réponse à ce tweet par un journaliste espagnol.

Si le Front national ne plaide pas officiellement pour l'unité de l'Espagne et dit appeler ""au dialogue"" entre les deux parties, le parti d'extrême droite (opposé au régionalisme) ne cache pas son hostilité envers le pouvoir catalan.

Dès le lendemain du référendum, alors que de nombreux observateurs s'étonnaient de la violence de la répression ordonnée par le pouvoir central, David Rachline renvoyait les Catalans à leur responsabilité, indiquant qu'il y avait eu ""des violences des deux côtés"".

Identité, référendum: deux carburants frontistes

Au vrai, le parti de Marine Le Pen est bien embarrassé par la situation. Alors que la candidate frontiste brandissait le ""peuple"" comme argument de campagne lors de la présidentielle, la députée du Nord ne peut pas se permettre de condamner trop sévèrement ce qui peut être perçu en France comme une aspiration légitime et populaire à revendiquer une identité, thème ô combien important au FN. La formation lepéniste a donc choisi trois angles d'attaque pour contester l'aventure de Carles Puigdemont: l'Union européenne, le gouvernement catalan et l'illégalité du scrutin.

""Il est à noter que le PP espagnol soutenu par l'Europe technocratique de Bruxelles porte une grande responsabilité dans ces événements. En effet, la politique européenne en soutenant les revendications régionalistes ou séparatistes a placé certains États de l'Union dans des situations intenables"", dénonce le parti dans un communiqué du 2 octobre, pointant également ""l'attitude sectaire des indépendantistes soutenus par l'extrême gauche catalane totalitaire et antidémocratique"".

Élu dans les Pyrénées-Orientales (en Catalogne française), le député FN Louis Aliot ne dit pas autre chose. ""Je regardais les chiffres, le fameux référendum, c'est quand même 90% de 46% de votants, paraît-il, sans aucun contrôle, ni quoi que ce soit"", déclarait-il juste après la déclaration d'indépendance. Plutôt surprenant venant d'une formation politique qui soutenait le référendum (tout autant illégal) en Crimée.

Dimanche 29 octobre, Marine Le Pen est allée jusqu'à accuser Bruxelles de pousser au séparatisme, alors que les États membres dans leur ensemble font bloc derrière Madrid (vidéo ci-dessous).

Une vision des choses que partage complètement Florian Philippot. ""L'UE est bien embêtée, mais elle a joué avec le feu, en encourageant les régionalismes"", a estimé ce lundi 30 octobre le président des ""Patriotes"".

Le Front national a aussi demandé ce lundi la dénonciation d'un accord entre la Catalogne et la Région IDF. ""Il ne nous est pas permis, en tant que collectivité régionale française, d'encourager la division d'autres peuples et d'autres territoires par l'entretien de relations procurant à leur désir d'autonomie une forme de reconnaissance internationale"", écrit dans un communiqué, Wallerand de Saint-Just, président du groupe FN au Conseil régional.

""Vive la Catalogne libre""

D'autres voix se font entendre à l'extrême droite de l'échiquier politique, et parmi les alliés du FN. C'est notamment le cas de Robert Ménard, qui a livré un véritable plaidoyer pour l'indépendantisme catalan au nom de la promotion de l'identité.

""Comment ceux-là même qui n'ont à la bouche qu'un seul mot –l'identité– peuvent-ils vouer aux gémonies un peuple –parce qu'il y a bien un peuple catalan, comme il y a un peuple français, un peuple corse, un peuple espagnol– qui veut prendre son destin en main"", interroge le maire de Béziers sur Boulevard Voltaire, site fondé et dirigé par... Emmanuelle Ménard, laquelle siège avec les députés frontistes à l'Assemblée nationale.

""Vive la Catalogne libre"", s'enthousiasme encore l'édile élu avec le soutien du FN, qui se félicitait dans un tweet de voir ""l'identité plus que jamais d'actualité"".

#Catalogne indépendante : l'identité plus que jamais d'actualité ! — Robert Ménard (@RobertMenardFR) 27 octobre 2017

""On ne maintient pas de force au sein d'un pays dans lequel, à tort ou à raison, il ne se reconnaît plus, un peuple qui veut s'instaurer en État"", estime-t-il. Soit peu ou prou ce que disait le vice-président du Front national en PACA, Philippe Vadon, en marge du référendum sur l'indépendance de l'Ecosse en 2014.

""À un moment n'est-ce pas la volonté des peuples qui fait aussi les nations?"", avait tweeté le co-fondateur de Nissa Rebela. Philippe Vardon avait été évincé du Rassemblement Bleu Marine l'année précédente car jugé ""européistes et régionalistes"" par la présidente du FN (avant son retour en grâce dans le sillage de Marion Maréchal Le Pen en 2015).

@gabirobfrance @DonatienVeret @DMdoubleV Vrai bien sûr, mais à un moment n'est-ce pas la volonté des peuples qui fait aussi les nations ? — Philippe Vardon (@P_Vardon) 18 septembre 2014

À noter que celui qui se définit comme ""enraciné"" sur son compte Twitter reste particulièrement silencieux sur les événements en Catalogne.

Car au delà de la seule divergence ""jacobins VS régionalistes"", c'est le dilemme auquel est confronté le Front national qui s'exprime à travers la crise catalane. À savoir, l'arbitrage entre les revendications identitaires qui s'accommodent d'une politique économique libérale (ce qu'incarne notamment Robert Ménard) et un souverainisme fondé uniquement sur la contestation de Bruxelles.

Un clivage exprimé on ne peut plus clairement par Florian Philippot. ""Ménard est ultra-européiste, ultra-libéral.

These young people are the future workers and leaders of our society, and if they're struggling, and not functioning optimally, it bodes ill for the rest of us.

According to an article by Kristin Rushowy in the Toronto Star, a new report released in Ontario shows that the mental health of our college and university students is at an all-time low.

Linda Franklin, president of Colleges Ontario, warns in the Star story that ""we are seeing the acceleration of these challenges beyond what we might have expected to see."" This means that the size of this problem is worse than what we might expect under ordinary circumstances.

CBC recently reported on the dire situation in East Coast universities in Canada, where young people arecommitting suicideat an alarming rate.

The article quotes Elizabeth Cawley, the regional mental health coordinator with the Association of Atlantic Universities, who states that it's ""absolutely urgent that we begin tackling student mental health.""

In both of the above stories, a variety of possible solutions to the problem is discussed, but there's no mention in either article of the possible causes. I suggest that helicopter parenting, which has become more and more common these days, could be in part what's at fault.

We're living in extremely challenging times due to a variety of political, social and economic reasons. Because of this, it's essential that our youth are raised to be independent thinkers, good problem-solvers, self-sufficient and resilient in dealing with the ups and downs of young adulthood.

Helicopter parents, while having the best of intentions, inadvertently cripple their children by doing too much for them. Their hovering and smothering leaves their kids unable to cope with the typical challenges they might face when they arrive at college or university.

The more parents bubble-wrap their children, the less confident, independent and self-sufficient these kids will be. The more the parents solve their kids' problems, the less these young people are equipped to deal with their own difficulties, if and when they should arise.

Helicopter parenting is, to some extent, a backlash against the previous, harsher and more negligent parenting styles, as well as an over-reaction to perceived (but non-existent) threats, such as ""stranger-danger.""

Many parents these days are overly-invested in the progress of their children, doing everything they can, including their kids' homework, to ensure that their children are accepted into the best schools and receive the best grades.

Unfortunately, over-parenting doesn't make for more successful kids, it leads to children who grow up unable to function at their best. I believe that this is one reason why we're seeing a disproportionately large number of young people suffering from anxiety disorders today.

The more parents bubble-wrap their children, the less confident, independent and self-sufficient these kids will be.

We can throw more money into treatment, but this will only be a drop in an ever-expanding bucket. I think that it will be a lot more cost-effective and more importantly, beneficial to our young people, to address the root cause of the problem.

That's why I believe that it's time we start teaching parents that helicoptering is the worst thing they can do for their kids. We have to show parents that hovering over their kids, over-protecting them, fighting all their battles and doing too much for them is setting these kids up for mental health problems in the future.

When parents learn to back off from their hovering and instead, raise their children to stand on their own two feet and solve their own problems, we're going to see more young people with good coping strategies, confidence and resilience.

When parents begin to instill qualities like autonomy and self-sufficiency into their children, I'm convinced that we'll start to see a significant decrease in mental health problems in our college-aged youth.

Nach der Begeisterung über seinen Wahlsieg, erwartet die zweite Republik eine Welle der Ernüchterung. Für mich ist schon jetzt klar: Kurz könnte Österreich in eine schwere Krise stürzen. Doch wieso eigentlich?

Das ""Time Magazine"" nannte Sebastian Kurz im März 2017 ""a new kind of statesman"" und betrachtete ihn als ""next genereation leader"".

Die Begründung: Nachdem im Jahr 2015 89.098 Flüchtlinge in Österreich Asyl beantragt hatten, verweigerte Kurz weiteren Asylbewerbern den Zutritt. Angeblich seien weitere Flüchtlinge für das Land nicht mehr bewältigbar.

Allerdings bewies Österreich schon in früheren Krisenzeiten, dass solch eine Anzahl von Flüchtlingen sehr wohl aufgenommen werden können. Beispielsweise beim Balkankrieg, Anfang der neunziger Jahre. Damals flohen rund 115.000 Menschen aus Kroatien, Bosnien und dem Kosovo nach Österreich.

In ihrer Beurteilung über den jüngsten Kanzler in der Geschichte Österreichs schrieb das renommierte US-Magazin allerdings auch Kurz sei von den Zielen der Europäischen Union abgewichen: ""Kurz went rogue. Against the objections of the E.U."".

In der engsten Bedeutung des Wortes, steht ""rogue"" für ""skrupellos"", ""bösartig"" oder ""fehlgeleitet"". Das sind mit Sicherheit keine Attribute die ein Politiker der kommenden Generation in sich vereinen sollte.

Kurz und das Ende der Systemparteien

In der HuffPost stellte der Journalist Marco Fieber eine wichtige Frage:

""Kurz' Sieg hat erneut gezeigt: Der Bruch mit Partei-Traditionen bringt Erfolg - doch kann so die Politik erneuert werden?""

Wenn Marco Fieber in der Folge die Eigenschaften von Sebastian Kurz aufzählt und seine Vorgehensweise beschreibt, dann lässt sich klar erkennen: Das Auftreten von Sebastian Kurz kann keinesfalls als positiv bewertet werden.

Demnach brach Sebastian Kurz mit den Parteitraditionen der ÖVP. Dieses Vorgehen kennt man bereits aus den 30er Jahren in Deutschland. Damals forderte Anhänger verschiedener politischer Vereinigungen, die sogenannten ""Systemparteien"" der Weimarer Republik abzulösen.

Doch was ist das überhaupt das gegenwärtige System? Die Antwort ist klar: die parlamentarische Demokratie. Doch diese muss in Österreich gefördert werden und darf keinesfalls behindert werden. Denn gerade die parlamentarische Arbeit in Österreich bedarf deutlicher Verbesserungen.

Bevor er für die ÖVP in das Rennen um die Nationalratswahl stieg, verlangte Sebastian Kurz von seiner Partei, dass alle seine Bedingungen total akzeptiert werden müssen. Nur dann würde er die Führerschaft der Partei übernehmen.

Das galt für alle Inhalte, sowohl auch für jede Personalfrage. Für die Wahl wurde der Parteiname sogar in ""Liste Sebastian Kurz"" umbenannt.

Die bedingungslose Kapitulation einer bürgerlichen Partei darf jedoch nicht das Ziel der österreichischen Politik sein. Die wichtigste Aufgabe einer Partei wie der ÖVP, ist die Sicherung von Inhalten und Werten im Bereich von Wirtschaft und Bildung.

Das sind beides Themen, die in der Politik von Sebastian Kurz kaum eine Rolle spielen. Das gleiche Gilt für die Politiker auf der ""Liste Kurz"".

Politik ist mehr als gute PR

Gute Politik darf nicht mit dem Erfolg einer funktionierenden PR-Maschine verwechselt werden, die das Fotomodel Sebastian Kurz in ein grelles Rampenlicht stellt.

Politik muss sich in Europa weiterhin an Inhalten orientieren. Sebastian Kurz ist ein Produkt, das einer Medienrealität entsprungen ist.

In der viel zitierten Flüchtlingsfrage stellte Kurz sich durch eigene showbetonte Auftritte in den Vordergrund. Bemerkenswerte Projekte, die ihn von anderen Politikern abheben, kann der 31-Jährige allerdings nicht vorweisen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ein doppeldeutiger Tweet von Sebastian Kurz zum österreichischen Nationalfeiertag wirft höchst unangenehme Fragen auf

Er entschied sich nicht etwa für Charity- oder Entwicklungsprojekte, mit denen er seine besonderen Fähigkeiten und Leistungen als Außenminister hätte beweisen können, sondern setzte auf ein Gefährt, welches er selbst als ""Geilomobil"" bezeichnete.

Damit suchte er spezielle Plätze in Wien auf. Eine Fotoserie wurde vor dem Nachtclub Moulin Rouge produziert. Der junge Politiker Kurz verwendete sie für seine Öffentlichkeitsarbeit.

Friedensbemühungen sollten Vorbild sein

Als herausragende Leistung eines Außenministers hätte man früher erwartet, dass er wesentliche Initiativen mit Friedensbemühungen und Friedensverhandlungen setzt.

Hingegen ist das Sperren einer Grenze, damit Flüchtlinge kriegerischer Handlungen nicht ins Land kommen können, keine besondere Tat. Die Medien sollten solche Aktionen nicht höher bewerten, als es tatsächlich der Fall ist.

Für Friedensinitiativen hätte Sebastian Kurz qualifizierte Persönlichkeiten in seinen Beraterstab oder in seine ""Liste Kurz"" holen müssen. International renommierte Persönlichkeiten gibt es in Österreich. Ein Beispiel ist der Friedensforscher Wilfried Graf, der aktuell in Israel tätig ist.

Auch Klaus Ottomeyer könnte man fragen. Ein Forscher aus Deutschland, der an der Universität Klagenfurt als Professor für Sozialpsychologie tätig war und der 2011 ein Buch publizierte, das für die Arbeit des Außenministers Kurz von Bedeutung sein sollte: ""Die Behandlung der Opfer. Über unseren Umgang mit dem Trauma der Flüchtlinge und der Verfolgten.""

Verletzung von Grundrechten

Während Sebastian Kurz seinen Wahlsieg feiert, werden in Österreich täglich Grundrechte verletzt. Österreich kann das Skandal-Land der Europäischen Union werden. Es gibt eklatante Verletzungen der Grundrechte der Charta der Europäischen Union.

Es gibt in Österreich tausende Fälle von Verletzungen der Grundrechte, insbesondere des Eigentumsrechts. Dies bestätigen jährliche Berichte der österreichischen Volksanwaltschaft.

Dabei geht es um die Verletzung von Rechten und strafrechtlich relevante Tatbestände, die vom österreichischen Justizministerium nicht bearbeitet werden.

Entsprechende Strafanzeigen werden von der Staatsanwaltschaft ignoriert. Rechtssicherheit ist damit in Österreich nicht mehr gegeben. Staatliche und politische Institutionen greifen seit Jahren nicht ein. Restitution und Schadenersatz ist in tausenden Fällen erforderlich.

In der HuffPost warnte ich bereits an anderer Stelle vor diesem rechtlichen Desaster.

Von einer bürgerlichen Partei wird erwartet, dass das Recht auf Eigentum verteidigt wird. Als ein grundlegender Wert der Weltanschauung, der offenbar in Österreich nicht mehr selbstverständlich ist. Mit ihrer aktuellen Führung versagt die ÖVP bei der Verteidigung dieses fundamentalen Grundrechts.

Wolfgang Brandstetter war zuletzt Justizminister in Österreich und ist nachweislich verantwortlich für die skandalösen Zustände in seinem Ministerium.

Dennoch kündigte Brandstetter bereits an, dass er in der nächsten Legislaturperiode wieder das Amt des Justizministers ausüben möchte.

Die nächste Bundesregierung wird mit dieser eklatanten Verletzung von Grundrechten garantiert noch konfrontiert werden. Ob Kurz das als alles stemmen kann, bleibt abzuwarten. Wenn nicht, dann steht Österreich vor dem vielleicht größten Skandal in der Geschichte der Europäischen Union.

Johannes Schütz schreibt aktuell an seinem Buch ""Die Enteigner: Der größte Skandal der Republik Österreich"". Er ist Medienwissenschaftler und ehemaliger Dozent an der Universität Wien.

Den Personen wird vorgeworfen, Terrorismus unterstützt zu haben

Nach dem gescheiterten Putsch 2016 in der Türkei haben Regierungskritiker Zuflucht in Deutschland gesucht. Etwa Hundert von ihnen droht nun eine Anklage wegen Terrorverdachts, berichten die ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"", NDR und WDR am Sonntag.

Demnach handelt sich dabei um türkische Akademiker, die 2016 einen offenen Brief an die türkische Regierung unterzeichnet hatten. In dem Brief wird der Umgang der türkischen Regierung mit den Kurden kritisiert.

In der Anklageschrift, die der ""SZ"", dem NDR und dem WDR vorliegen, heiße es, der Brief trage den Charakter ""der offenen Propaganda für die Terrororganisation PKK"". Die kurdische Arbeiterpartei (PKK) gilt in der Türkei - und auch in der EU - als Terror-Organisation und ist daher verboten.

Die Türkei und die PKK

In dem offenen Brief wird das Vorgehen der türkischen Sicherheitskräfte in kurdischen Siedlungsgebieten als ""Vernichtungs- und Vertreibungspolitik"" bezeichnet.

Der türkische Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan geht hart im eigenen Land gegen die kurdische Minderheit vor - und unterstützt die militärische Offensive der irakischen Regierung gegen das kurdische Autonomiegebiet.

In einem UN-Bericht vom März 2017 wurden der Türkei schwere Menschenrechtsverletzungen im Umgang mit der kurdischen Minderheit vorgeworfen.

Türkische Sicherheitskräfte hätten zwischen Juli 2015 und Dezember 2016 ganze Stadtteile im Südosten des Landes niedergemäht und bis zu einer halben Millionen Menschen vertrieben.

Ankara dagegen macht die verbotene PKK für Gewalt und Zerstörung verantwortlich. Die Unterzeichner des ""Friedensappels"" hatte Erdogan nach der Veröffentlichung des Briefs als Sympathisanten kurdischer Terroristen bezeichnet.

Auslieferung ist unwahrscheinlich

Nun folgt also die offizielle Anklage. Nach Informationen von ""SZ"", NDR und WDR sollen mindestens fünf Unterzeichner eine Anklage in den vergangenen Tagen erhalten haben. Auch die übrigen Unterzeichner müssten sich auf eine Anklage einstellen, heißt es in dem Bericht unter Berufung auf die türkische Staatsanwaltschaft.

Eine Auslieferung drohe den betroffenen Personen allerdings nicht, berichten ""SZ"", NDR und WDR weiter. In Deutschland sei dafür das örtlich zuständige Oberlandesgericht zuständig - und bei den Gerichten herrsche mittlerweile eine ""erhöhte Skepsis"" gegenüber Vorwürfen aus der Türkei.

Allerdings drohe den nach Deutschland geflohenen Türken, dass sie international zur Fahndung ausgeschrieben werden würden. Dann könnten sie nicht mehr gefahrlos reisen.

Mehr als 50 Berliner haben sich in einer Woche mit dem Norovirus angesteckt

Die Magen-Darm-Krankheit gilt als hochansteckend

Daher sollte jeder die Symptome kennen und sein Verhalten anpassen

Der Norovirus breitet sich in Berlin aus: In den vergangenen Wochen haben sich die Zahlen verdoppelt. Mitte Oktober infizierten sich demnach in einer Woche 52 Menschen mit dem hochansteckenden Magen-Darm-Virus, in der Woche zuvor waren es 56.

In den 20 Wochen waren es durchschnittlich nur halb so viele Menschen. Das geht aus den jüngsten Wochenberichten des Landesamts für Gesundheit und Soziales hervor.

Insgesamt liegt die Zahl der für dieses Jahr erfassten Norovirus-Erkrankungen in Berlin bei 2224. Die meisten Meldungen kamen aus Treptow-Köpenick, Pankow und Steglitz-Zehlendorf. Das liegt aber noch unter dem Mittelwert der vergangenen fünf Jahre.

Besonders in Kitas und Altenheimen breitet sich die Krankheit aus

Grund zum Panik ist der Anstieg also nicht - er ist viel mehr typisch für die Jahreszeit. Normalerweise ist bis März mit einer stärkeren Ausbreitung der Krankheit zu rechnen.

Gerade in Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen wie Kindertagesstätten und Altenheime sind dann betroffen. Denn der Norovirus ist extrem anstrengend. Müssen Infizierte erbrechen, gelangen kleinste virushaltige Tröpfen in die Luft - die Krankheit kann sich so beinahe unbemerkt ausbreiten.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Mutierter Norovirus geht um: So schützt ihr euch vor einer Ansteckung

Wie ihr eine Norovirus-Infektion erkennt

Die Krankheitssymptome kommen in der Regel plötzlich. Typisch sind starker Durchfall und Erbrechen. Auch klagen die Betroffenen über Übelkeit, Kopfschmerzen und Mattigkeit. Die Norovirus-Symptome dauern bis zu 70 Stunden.

Das Gesundheitsamt Berlin rät zur Bettruhe in der akuten Phase und gut durchgegarten Speisen. Auch wenn es bei den Symptomen vermutlich leicht fällt: Verzichtet möglichst auf Kontakt zu anderen. Und achtet auf eine gute Handdesinfektion.

Wenn die Symptome abgeklungen sind, kann das Virus noch 48 Stunden übertragen werden und weitere sechs bis 14 Tage kann der Patient das Virus ausscheiden, warnt das Gesundheitsamt Berlin.

Dort gewinnt sie schnell an Einfluss

Eine zentrale Rolle spielt dabei die AfD, die ihren akademischen Nachwuchs an den Unis rekrutiert

Irgendwann wurde es Anne Schäpermeier zu viel.

Unbekannte schmierten wie “Scheiß Islam” und “Merkel muss weg” in Bücher und auf Zettel und verstecken sie in den Regalen der Saarländischen Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek in Saarbrücken und auf Toiletten des Campus'.

""Sowas geht gar nicht"", sagt Schäpermeierm, die den Ausleihbereich leitet und dem Direktorium der Uni-Bibliothek angehört. Sie berichtet von mindestens 15 Fällen.

“Die Bibliothek ist ein Ort für alle - und wir wollen keine diskriminierenden Parolen hier”, sagt sie.

Also stellte sie ein Schild in die Bibliothek auf - um die Studenten auf das Problem aufmerksam zu machen und den oder die Täter zu warnen.

Denn was nach harmlosen Kritzeleien aussieht, bereitet immer mehr Universitäten in Deutschland Sorge.

""Auch die AfD muss sich um ihren akademischen Nachwuchs kümmern""

Zwar gelten Deutschlands Hochschulen noch “eher als eine linke Bastion””, wie der Experte Torsten Bultmann vom Bund demokratischer Wissenschaftler im Gespräch mit der HuffPost sagt - “zumindest, was die Studierendenvertretungen und den sog. akademischen Mittelbau betrifft.”

“Doch diese Bastion droht, zu fallen”, sagt er. “Die rechte Szene stellt sich an den Hochschulen neu auf und gewinnt überraschend schnell an Einfluss.”

Lange Zeit galten alleine die Burschenschaften als wichtigste Anlaufstelle für Rechte. Das ändert sich nun.

Mit den Wahlerfolgen der AfD gewinnt allerdings deren Hochschule-Partei Campusalternative an Bedeutung. Außerdem tritt die Identitären Bewegung immer selbstbewusster unter Studierenden auf.

“Auch die AfD muss sich um ihren akademischen Nachwuchs kümmern”, sagt Experte Bultmann. Eine Partei, die sich etablieren wolle, müsse auch auf Akademiker zugehen.

“Also müssen sie an den Hochschulen Flagge zeigen”, sagt er. In mehreren Unis sitzt die Campus Alternative bereits im Studierendenparlament - etwa an der Fernuni Hagen, in Kiel, Kassel und Düsseldorf.

Bisweilen absurde Vorschläge

Dort machen ihre Vertreter mit bisweilen absurden Vorschlägen auf sich aufmerksam.

In Düsseldorf etwa wurde ein Antrag gestellt, eine Deutschlandfahne auf dem Campus zu hissen und das Genderreferat zu streichen.

In Magdeburg machte die Campus Alternative Schlagzeilen, weil sie den AfD-Landeschef André Poggenburg zu einem Vortrag an die TU lud.

Noch während der Veranstaltung kam es zum Eklat, weil Studenten das Podium stürmten und Poggenburg mit Sicherheitsleuten den Hörsaal verließ.

Angstraum neben dem Campus

Wohl in kaum einer anderen Stadt ist die Nähe der Rechten zur Uni so spürbar wie in Halle an der Saale.

Die Bewegung ""Ein Prozent"", ein Ableger der rechtsextremen Identitären Bewegung, unterhält dort ein Haus direkt gegenüber des Campus'.

Das Haus wurde nicht nur von einem hessischen AfD-Abgeordneten gekauft, außerdem unterhält der AfD-Landtagsabgeordnete Hans-Thomas Tillschneider dort sein Parteibüro.

Der Standort ist bewusst provozierend - und strategisch gewählt, sagt Wanja Seifert vom Bündnis ""Halle gegen Rechts"": ""Das Haus liegt auf dem direkten Weg vieler Studenten.""

Er berichtet von regelmäßigen Angriffen, ""für viele Studenten ist das ein Angstraum, der bewusst gemieden wird.""

Die Inszenierung der Identitären

Auch rechte Burschenschaften spielen ein wichtige Rolle in der Stadt.

So sind die Mitgliederlisten der Identitären und der Burschenschaft Halle-Leobener B! Germania fast identisch.



Einige Burschenschaft dienen als Sammelbecken der Rechten

So entsteht eine gefährliche Allianz aus Identitären, Burschenschaften und der AfD, die auch in anderen Städten zu beobachten ist.

Verbindungsglied ist dabei der Dachverband Deutsche Burschenschaft (DB). ""Die ist ein Sammelbecken für unterschiedliche politische Strömungen der Rechten - vom Konservativismus bis hin zum Neonazismus"", erklärt Alexandra Kurth.

Kurth ist Politikwissenschaftlerin an der Uni Gießen und beschäftigt sich seit Jahren mit den Themen Rechtsextremismus und Burschenschaften.

Sie sagt: ""DB-Burschenschaften sind ein Anknüpfungspunkt für rechte Organisationen. Die Identitären benennen das ganz offen. Sie halten ihre Anhänger dazu an, den Kontakt zu Burschenschaften zu suchen.""

""Geblieben ist nur der harte Kern""

Seit den Abspaltungsprozessen im Jahr 2011 hat sich die DB weiter radikalisiert, viele gemäßigte Burschenschaften sind damals ausgetreten, ""geblieben ist nur der harte Kern"", sagt Kurth.

Das ist zwar objektiv eine - personelle und finanzielle - Schwächung gewesen.

Allerdings wurde die Verkleinerung durch die allgemeine politische Lage und insbesondere durch den Erfolg der AfD zur Stärke.

""Denn dadurch hat sich die Chance für die verblieben Burschenschafter erhöht, von den Ressourcen der AfD zu profitieren"", sagt Kurth. Für sie ist klar: ""Die DB ist ein Personalreservoir für die AfD.""

""Einstellungswelle im Bundestag""

Dabei zeichnet sich ein Trend ab. Bereits etliche AfD-Landtagsabgeordneten hatten eine Reihe von Burschenschaftern eingestellt.

Nun werde es bei den Abgeordneten im Bundestag vermutlich eine ähnliche Einstellungswelle geben, sagt Kurth - ""wo sollen die ganzen wissenschaftlichen Mitarbeiter auch sonst herkommen?""","""Die letzte Bastion der Linken fällt"": Wie AfD, Identitäre und rechte Burschenschaften versuchen, deutsche Unis zu unterwandern",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/29/afd-unis-unterwandern_n_18412832.html?utm_hp_ref=germany

“We love Tristan so much, and she’s so happy, and she’s been through so much,” Jenner said. “Just seeing her be able to do something so creative with [her denim line] Good American ― that’s her passion. On top of it, to be in such a great place in her personal life is amazing. She’s really happy.”

Mehr über den Ausgleichsfonds und seine Erträge erfahrt ihr in unserem Video

Der bayerische Staat hat wegen Sondergenehmigungen kaum Kontrolle über die Erträge des Ausgleichsfonds

Deutschland hat wie jede moderne Demokratie ein wichtiges Grundrecht: Die Gleichheit vor dem Gesetz. Dieses Recht sollte für alle gelten.

Doch für manche scheint es Ausnahmen zu geben. Zum Beispiel für einige Mitglieder des sogenannten deutschen Hochadels. Die Familie der Wittelsbacher kassiert bis heute jedes Jahr 14 Millionen Euro als Entschädigung dafür, dass das ehemalige bayerische Königshaus auf seine Herrschaftsansprüche verzichtet hat. Plus: Die Gelder sind steuerfrei und unterliegen keinen Kontrollen.

Lange war der Öffentlichkeit nicht bekannt, wie lukrativ der Deal für die Adelsfamilie ist

Nach jahrelangem Streit traf der Freistaat 1923 während der Weimarer Republik eine Vereinbarung mit der abgesetzten Königsfamilie und legte den Wittelsbacher Ausgleichfonds (WAF) auf. Mehr dazu erfahrt ihr auch in unserem Video. Darin befinden sich Gelder, Unternehmensanteile, Ländereien, Schlösser und Kunstschätze. Mit dem WAF, einer Stiftung des öffentlichen Rechts, soll das kulturelle Erbe des Hauses Wittelsbach bewahrt und vor allem die Erben der bayerischen Könige alimentiert werden.

Auch Sonderprivilegien wie Wohnrechte im Würzburger Residenzschloss, auf Herrenchiemsee und in Nymphenburg sowie Ticketprovisionen für den Eintritt in verschiedene Schlösser gehören dazu. Lange war der Öffentlichkeit nicht bekannt, wie lukrativ der Deal für die Adelsfamilie ist.

Wie fürstlich die sogenannten Entschädigungen ausfallen, ergab eine Anfrage von Katharina Schulze, Abgeordnete der Grünen im bayerischen Landtag im vergangenen Jahr: Die Bilanzsumme betrug nach Auskunft des Finanzministeriums zuletzt 348 Millionen Euro. Durchschnittlich erhält die Familie aus dem Fonds etwa 14 Millionen pro Jahr, steuerfrei.

""Da lebt das adelige Leben fort, obwohl der Adel abgeschafft ist“, sagte Schulze dem ""Münchner Merkur“. ""Eine Begründung dafür kann es in einem demokratischen Staat eigentlich nicht mehr geben.“

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Studie: Deutsche sind Vizemeister im Steuern zahlen

Der Rechnungshof will den Ausgleichsfonds nicht prüfen - zumindest nicht bald

Auf Anfrage der HuffPost erklärt Schulze: ""Dies ist möglich wegen einer Sondergenehmigung: Vom Bayerischen Obersten Rechnungshof (ORH) wird der Fonds – im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen öffentlich-rechtlichen Stiftungen – nicht geprüft.“

Die Grünen beantragten daraufhin mehr Transparenz. Thomas Mütze, finanzpolitischer Sprecher, fordert eine Gleichbehandlung mit anderen öffentlich-rechtlichen Stiftungen – also eine Kontrolle des WAF. Die CSU lehnte den Antrag ab. ""Laut CSU sei er überflüssig, da der ORH die Vereinbarung jederzeit widerrufen könne“, berichtet Schulze.

Doch auf einen Widerruf der Sondergenehmigung scheint der Rechnungshof keine rechte Lust zu haben:“ Es gibt keine Anzeichen dafür, dass sich etwas ändert“, sagte der Grünen-Abgeordnete Thomas Mütze im Gespräch mit der HuffPost. Ein Sprecher des Rechnungshofes sagte dazu der ""Süddeutschen“ nur: ""Wann der ORH prüft, entscheidet er selber.“

""Dabei ging es uns bei dem Antrag nicht einmal um die Rechtmäßigkeit des Geldes, sondern nur um Transparenz“, sagte Mütze. Doch von Transparenz und Kontrolle durch den Staat scheint sich der Wittelsbacher Ausgleichfonds immer weiter zu entfernen.

""Das Finanzministerium will sich nicht mit dem ehemaligen Königshaus anlegen“

Das bayerische Finanzministerium versuchte nämlich in den vergangenen Jahren, mehr Kontrolle auf den WAF auszuüben – jedoch ohne Erfolg. Zuletzt trug es mit dem WAF einen Rechtsstreit aus, in dem es darum ging, wie viel Geld der Fonds ausschütten darf und wie weit die Kontrollrechte des Freistaats reichen. Doch als das Ministerium in der ersten Instanz unterlag, gab es auf.

""Seitdem passiert nichts mehr“, sagte Mütze. ""Das Finanzministerium will sich nicht mit dem ehemaligen Königshaus anlegen.“

Der Abgeordnete weist auch auf ein weiteres Sonderrecht innerhalb des WAF hin: ""Das Geld bekommen vor allem die männlichen Erben“, sagte er. Tatsächlich werden die weiblichen Mitglieder der Wittelsbacher stark benachteiligt. Die Erträge gehen zunächst an das männliche Oberhaupt der jeweiligen Linien der Adelsfamilie. Den Löwenanteil erhält der Urenkel des letzten bayerischen Königs und Chef der Wittelsbacher, Franz Herzog von Bayern.

Frauen erhalten dagegen nur ""bis zu ihrer Vermählung“ Geld aus dem Fonds. Gegen die Regelung klagten vor Jahrzehnten drei Prinzessinnen der Familie und beriefen sich dabei ironischerweise auf den Gleichheitsgrundsatz im Grundgesetz. Doch ihre Klage war nicht von Erfolg gekrönt.

Denn der WAF beruht auf Ungleichheit: Auch wenn heute laut Grundgesetz Gleichheit gilt - hier herrscht eine Regelung aus einer Zeit, in der Königsadel gegenüber Normalsterblichen, Männer gegenüber Frauen bevorzugt wurden.

Doch was war in einer Monarchie Privateigentum und was Eigentum des Staates?

Und was sagen die Wittelsbacher dazu? Das 84-jährige Oberhaupt Franz Herzog von Bayern residiert im Nymphenburger Schloss und wird als höflicher und freundlicher Herr beschrieben, der sich um die Belange der Familie kümmert und leidenschaftlicher Kunstsammler ist. Zu dem Antrag der Grünen sagte er der ""taz"": ""In jedem Fall ist es gut, wenn es eine gewisse Transparenz gibt. Wir haben da keine Geheimnisse.“

Weiter sagte er über den WAF und die Sonderprivilegien: ""Ich habe auch durchaus Verständnis, wenn das der eine oder andere unzeitgemäß findet. Aber ein Privileg klingt für mich wie etwas, was einem aus Gunst verliehen wurde. In unserem Fall waren es aber rein privatrechtliche Ansprüche.“

Adel verpflichtet, sagt man so schön. Tatsächlich vernichtet er wohl eher – und zwar jede Vorstellung von Gleichheit in der Gesellschaft.

The ""gig economy"" and automation are just two phenomena shaping our working future. Jobs are being ""unbundled"" and tasked out, piecemeal, across the globe. Emerging technologies are changing the ways we interface with our workplaces.

The result of these emerging trends is disruption, transition — and what Finance Minister Bill Morneau has labelled ""job churn.""

Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

On job churn, Morneau has asked, ""How do we train and retrain people as they move from job to job to job? Because it's going to happen. We have to accept that."" Morneau is on the money. The ability to quickly retrain and redeploy workers, when either market forces or technology disrupt, will be paramount to Canada succeeding in the economy of the future.

One of the keys to success will be to identify the specific work-related skills of individuals who find themselves in transition and match them to jobs or short-term retraining opportunities. So where should we invest our energies?

We can turn to Canada's veterans for a positive model for the future.

Programs that are currently being run to assist veterans' transition to the civilian workforce can offer insight into how we can ease worker transition as changing economic forces confront our workplaces.

Many Canadian soldiers are unable to convert their advanced training into meaningful careers, even though the skill sets and experiences accumulated by soldiers would be highly valued by civilian employers. So how do we get these valuable workers into the Canadian economy? A polytechnic has the answer.

A pivoting economy is no small challenge to tackle

The British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) developed a solution at its SITE Centre, which conducts prior learning-related research and assessment activities and turns them into advanced-placement education options. At BCIT, the legion military skills conversion program accelerates and advances the civilian careers of former and current members of the Canadian Forces. They do this by mapping learning outcomes rather than course equivalencies, so that those from non-traditional educational backgrounds are given advanced standing in education and training programs.

The ability to map the existing skills and abilities individuals possess — specifically those that are not backed up by a formal credential — is called Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR). Mapping these helps the individual qualify for new education or training opportunities that may not otherwise be open to them.

PLAR also helps these veterans to identify careers that they may not have considered on their own. Once skills have been identified and mapped, equivalent credits can be granted or veterans can be given advanced standing in a program. If they opt to join the civilian workforce, mentorship opportunities are made available and they will have access to tools that match the skills they have to the jobs that are available.

Similar success has been found at Algonquin College. Michael was a 39-year-old who had retired after a successful military career of 15 years and was looking to enter the workforce in a different field. After finding it hard to get a job in the absence of post-secondary credentials, Michael was surprised to learn that he could receive credits for his life experience by using PLAR services offered at Algonquin College. Michael enrolled in the Community and Justice Services diploma program and was able to graduate by receiving credit for almost half the program based on his prior learning and life experiences.

So how can we scale what works well in the veterans' retraining program to the changes in our economic landscape?

As more individuals face work transition due to the gig economy and automation, we can build workforce resilience and smooth transitions in the workplace by mapping skills and capabilities through the wider use and application of PLAR.

The combination of career navigation and skills assessment can help newcomers, under-represented and disadvantaged groups and older workers find meaningful work. In so doing, Canada's inclusive growth aspirations can be realized.

Canada's polytechnics and colleges each already possess the complementary capabilities of skill identification and prior learning assessment and recognition, as well as the ability to deploy time-compressed courses for those looking to retrain. These capabilities, coupled with polytechnics' tight connections to industry, mean these institutions are an integral asset in the mission to keep workers in the labour market — and our economy moving forward.

A pivoting economy is no small challenge to tackle — workers are displaced and new skill sets need to be acquired. In order to ensure all Canadians are successful in the face of transition, disruption and job churn, we must scale the capabilities our nation already possesses. The success of veterans' programs is a good model to follow.

""Je ne ne connais pas la personne qui a pris la photo"", explique la journaliste auprès du HuffPost. Sa belle-sœur, qui l'a vue sur le groupe Facebook Wanted Community Paris, l'avait partagée, elle a fait de même en la postant sur Twitter. D'autres personnes avaient déjà publié d'autres photos du couple, il y a un an. Sans que cela ne leur permette de s'en sortir. ""J'ai été surprise par l'énormité de la réaction en chaîne"", poursuit-elle.

Sur les conseils de son frère, elle a appelé le couple, échangé avec eux par téléphone pour s'enquérir de leur état, leur proposer son aide. Et selon elle, beaucoup ont suivi son exemple, et leur ont téléphoné jusqu'à tard dans la nuit.

""Ils vivent dans une cabane sur les rives de Seine, dans le Val-de-Marne"", décrit-elle. ""Lui me disait: 'pour m'en sortir, je veux travailler'.""

Après plusieurs demandes sur Twitter, Chloé Safra a finalement ouvert une cagnotte, qui a récolté plus de 500€ pour le couple. ""Je pense que ce qui fait que ça a touché tant de personnes, c'est cette photo, ils ressemblent à de simples parents, ou grands-parents"", détaille-t-elle.

D'après la journaliste, plusieurs personnes sont venues les voir, leur apporter notamment des couvertures. Mais surtout, on leur a proposé des petits boulots pour les aider à s'en sortir, et même un logement. ""Un monsieur leur a proposé un studio"", explique-t-elle, ""ils devraient bientôt récupérer les clés"". De quoi s'abriter du froid au moins pour l'hiver.

Είμαι 23 ετών, μια ηλικία που δε θα έπρεπε να είχα φτάσει ποτέ, αν η πρόγνωσή μου έβγαινε αληθινή. Αν και η πάθησή μου μειώνει δραστικά το προσδόκιμο της ζωής μου, η ζωή μου παραμένει φανταστική. Αν σας έλεγα όμως ότι ο λόγος που η ζωή μου είναι τόσο φανταστική είναι η ίδια μου η πάθηση, θα το πιστεύατε;

Γεννήθηκα με προβλήματα υγείας, τα οποία δεν διαγνώστηκαν και δε συνδέθηκαν μεταξύ τους για πολλά χρόνια, παρότι είδα αρκετούς ειδικούς κατά την περίοδο αυτή. Η κατάστασή μου επιδεινώθηκε στη διάρκεια της παιδικής μου ηλικίας, κατά την οποία είχα μία ενεργή ζωή παρά τα προβλήματά μου, τα οποία απέκρυβα όσο καλύτερα μπορούσα. Όταν έφτασα στην ηλικία των 9 ετών τα πράγματα άρχισαν να επιδεινώνονται πιο γρήγορα. Από την ηλικία των 11 ξεκίνησα φυσιοθεραπεία και παρότι παρέμεινα ενεργή, κάνοντας ιππασία και δουλεύοντας στους στάβλους, η επιδείνωση συνεχίστηκε μέχρι που το σώμα μου κατέρρευσε τον Ιανουάριο του 2008. Έμεινα παράλυτη. Η πάθηση μου συνέχιζε την πορεία της, το μυϊκό μου σύστημα κατέρρεε, τα ζωτικά μου όργανα έπαυαν να λειτουργούν το ένα μετά το άλλο και απαιτούνταν όλο και πιο επεμβατικές ιατρικές παρεμβάσεις, μέχρι που το 2011 έλαβα τα νέα ότι η πάθησή μου θα συντόμευε δραστικά τη διάρκεια της ζωής μου. Το 2012 μάλιστα με ενημέρωσαν ότι οι ιατροί δεν ανέμεναν να ζήσω άλλα πέντε χρόνια.

Το να μαθαίνεις ότι η πάθησή σου μειώνει το προσδόκιμο της ζωής σου είναι πραγματικά δυσβάσταχτο, αλλά το αστείο είναι ότι αρνήθηκα να το πιστέψω. Στο δικό μου μυαλό, δεν είδα ποτέ τον εαυτό μου να έχει μικρότερη ζωή. Παρόλα αυτά, δοθείσης της διάγνωσής μου έπρεπε να αρχίσω την προετοιμασία μου για το τέλος της ζωής μου. Έπρεπε να βάλω τα πράγματα σε σειρά και να ολοκληρώσω ένα προγραμματισμό που θα μου εξασφάλιζε ότι οι τελευταίες επιθυμίες μου θα γινόταν σεβαστές και θα ακολουθούνταν και ότι θα ήμουν προετοιμασμένη για την φροντίδα μου κατά τις τελευταίες μέρες της ζωής μου και τον θάνατό μου. Η προετοιμασία αυτή ολοκληρώθηκε αρχικά το 2011 και αυτό έγινε ακόμα περισσότερο σημαντικό όταν το 2012 μάθαμε ότι η πρόγνωσή μου δεν ξεπερνούσε τα πέντε έτη.

Ήταν η ίδια η διαδικασία προγραμματισμού του τέλους της ζωής μου το 2011 που με οδήγησε στο να έχω μία πραγματικά νέα ζωή.

Μία συναρπαστική ζωή με νόημα, που θα μπορούσα να την απολαύσω παρά την επιδείνωση της υγείας μου και τους περιορισμούς που αυτή έθετε στη διαβίωσή μου. Άρχισα πραγματικά «να ζώ» πάλι και να έχω μία ζωή για την οποία ήμουν περιφανή.

Καθώς η μητέρα μου, η νοσοκόμα μου και εγώ αρχίσαμε να διατρέχουμε το πλάνο μου και να καταγράφουμε τις επιθυμίες μου, ξαφνικά ξεστόμισα ότι φοβόμουν να πεθάνω και να ξεχαστώ, ότι τίποτα δε θα ήταν καλύτερο ή διαφορετικό εξαιτίας της ζωής μου και ότι η ύπαρξή μου δε θα είχε κανένα νόημα. Αυτό που είπα, ξάφνιασε ακόμα και εμένα, καθώς δεν το είχα σκεφτεί συνειδητά ποτέ. Αυτή η ξαφνική συνειδητοποίηση θα μου άλλαζε τη ζωή.

Δύο χρόνια από τη συζήτηση αυτή, η νοσοκόμα μου άκουσε ότι μία φιλανθρωπική οργάνωση που σκοπό είχε την ανακουφιστική φροντίδα παιδιών έψαχνε για ένα νέο άτομο για να μιλήσει κατά τη διάρκεια εκδήλωσής της στη Βουλή των Κοινοτήτων. Η νοσοκόμα μου με πρότεινε για τον ρόλο αυτό και όταν ερωτήθηκα απάντησα θετικά. Ξεκίνησα να γράφω τον λόγο μου και να προετοιμάζομαι σοβαρά για την εκφώνησή του και η δύσκολή μέρα έφτασε γρήγορα. Η 19η Νοεμβρίου 2013, ήταν η μέρα που θα άλλαζε τη ζωή μου. Αφού γνώρισα κάποιους από τους βουλευτές, σημαντικές προσωπικότητες και εκπροσώπους φιλανθρωπιών, έφτασε η σειρά μου να μιλήσω. Οδηγήθηκα μέχρι τη σκηνή, γύρισα να αντικρίσω τους εκατό περίπου καλεσμένους που βρίσκονταν στο δωμάτιο και εκφώνησα το λόγο μου. Είπα την τελευταία μου πρόταση και κοιτάζοντας πάνω από τα χαρτιά μου είδα το δωμάτιο να εκρήγνυται σε χειροκροτήματα. Τα είχα καταφέρει. Και τι κατόρθωμα.

Από τη μέρα αυτή, έχω καταφέρει αρκετά πράγματα. Έχω γράψει blogs και άρθρα σε πολλούς ιστότοπους, τρεις προλόγους σε καθοδηγητικά κείμενα και ένα βιβλίο, έχω εκφωνήσει αρκετούς λόγους σε εκδηλώσεις που κυμαίνονται από εθνικά συνέδρια μέχρι ανεπίσημες συναντήσεις, έχω εμφανιστεί στην τηλεόραση και τα media, είμαι σύμβουλος σε ένα ερευνητικό πρόγραμμα, διαχειρίζομαι την ιστοσελίδα και τα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης μίας φιλανθρωπικής οργάνωσης και άλλα. Διατηρώ θέσεις σε έξι φιλανθρωπικές οργανώσεις και μία οργάνωση πολιτών και συνεργάζομαι με ακόμα περισσότερες φιλανθρωπικές και οργανισμούς σε μεμονωμένες δράσεις. Έχω και πολλά σχέδια για το μέλλον, καθώς και ένα επιτυχημένο blog. To 2016 μου απονεμήθηκε η βασιλική, τιμητική διάκριση MBE (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) για τις υπηρεσίες μου προς τα άτομα με αναπηρία, σε ηλικία 22 ετών. Ακόμα ένα επίτευγμα, που δε μου φαίνεται καν πραγματικό. Μου απονεμήθηκε η διάκριση MBE από τον Πρίγκιπα Κάρολο στο παλάτι του Buckingham τον Ιούνιο του 2016. Η διάρκεια του έργου μου μπορεί να μην είναι μακριά, αλλά ο αντίκτυπος του οδήγησε στη βράβευσή μου. Παραμένω ενεργή, δουλεύοντας κάθε μέρα και πράττοντας οτιδήποτε μπορώ για να κάνω τη διαφορά. Η φωνή μου είναι το μόνο πράγμα που μπορώ να χρησιμοποιήσω εντελώς ανεξάρτητα από τη βοήθεια άλλων ατόμων και έτσι τη χρησιμοποιώ για όλους τους άλλους σαν και εμένα. Μία φωνή για αυτούς που δεν μπορούν να μιλήσουν για τον εαυτό τους ή που δεν έχουν την ευκαιρία να ακουστούν σε εθνικό ή διεθνές επίπεδο. Χρησιμοποιώ τις ικανότητες και την εμπειρία μου εποικοδομητικά προς όφελος των άλλων.

Και όλα αυτά, παρά μία εκφυλιστική πάθηση που μειώνει τη ζωή μου, παρότι είμαι συνδεδεμένη με ενδοφλέβιες αγωγές 21 ώρες τη μέρα και ενώ έχω δύο σωληνάρια απορροής και δύο σάκους κολοστομίας. Παρά τις εγχειρίσεις, 12 μάχες που έχω δώσει με τη σήψη, παρότι νοσηλεύομαι συχνά στο νοσοκομείο, παρότι μάχομαι για τη ζωή μου. Παρόλο που γνωρίζω ότι ο χρόνος νου στη γη θα είναι πολύ μικρότερος απ' ότι θα έπρεπε. Παρότι ξέρω ότι έχω ήδη ξεπεράσει το χρόνο που μου είχε δοθεί.

Κατά τη διάρκεια του έργου μου έχω αποκτήσει σκοπό, μία νέα ύπαρξη που με οδήγησε στο να ζω πραγματικά. Δεν διαβιώ μόνο πια, τώρα έχω μία χαρούμενη ζωή, συναρπαστική, γεμάτη «καλούδια».

Ακόμα υποφέρω από μία εκφυλιστική νόσο, βαίνοντας συνειδητά προς την επιδείνωση, είμαι συνεχώς χειρότερα και χάνω κάποιες από τις δυνατότητές μου, η κατάστασή μου γίνεται όλο και πιο εύθραυστή και δύσκολη ως προς τη διαχείρισή της, απαιτούνται περισσότερες ιατρικές παρεμβάσεις και πρέπει να αντιμετωπίσω ένα συνεχόμενο κύκλο θλίψης που έρχεται μαζί με κάθε πρόβλημα, επιπλοκή και επιδείνωση, αλλά παρόλα αυτά έχω μία ζωή που αξίζει να τη ζεις. Μία ζωή για την οποία είμαι περιφανή. Αν δε νοσούσα, θα είχα πριν λίγο καρό περάσει τις εξετάσεις για να γίνω ιατρός, το οποίο είναι για εμένα ένα μεγάλο πλήγμα, αλλά μου λένε τακτικά ότι πιθανότατα έχω κάνει περισσότερα κατά τη διάρκεια της ζωής μου και έχω τόση προσφορά προς την κοινωνία ως εκπρόσωπος ασθενών και πρέσβης τους από ότι θα μπορούσα θα μπορούσα να προσφέρω ως ιατρός. Θα ήθελα να πιστεύω ότι αυτό είναι αλήθεια.

Der Erzkonservative war als Sprecher des Kongresses der fähigste Gegenspieler von Barack Obama

Jetzt hat sich Boehner nach langem Schweigen zurückgemeldet - und seine eigene Partei heftig kritisiert

Jahrelang hat John Boehner seinen politischen Widersacher Barack Obama in den Wahnsinn getrieben. 2011 wurde der erzkonservative Politiker zum Sprecher des mehrheitlich republikanischen Kongresses in den USA - und blockierte von da an jedes politische Vorhaben des ehemaligen Präsidenten.

Boehner war der mächtigste Republikaner des Landes. Dann kam Donald Trump. Im Juni 2015 erklärte dieser, US-Präsident werden zu wollen. Er kaperte die Republikaner, machte aus der ehemals konservativ-traditionellen eine endgültig radikale, rechte Partei. Trump sitzt nun im Weißen Haus, Boehner ist im Ruhestand.

Im Oktober 2015 zog er sich aus der Politik zurück. Seitdem hat Boehner zu den chaotischen Ereignissen in den USA meist geschwiegen. Doch in einem bemerkenswerten Interview mit dem ""Politico Magazine"" hat sich Boehner nun zu Wort gemeldet - und seine eigene Partei mit heftigen Worten attackiert.

Boehner: ""Sie sind beide Arschlöcher""

Vor allem auf einen Politiker hatte es Boehner abgesehen: Jason Chaffetz. Chaffetz hatte vor wenigen Wochen überraschend seinen Rücktritt aus dem Kongress verkündet. Eigentlich war der Politiker als einer der Hoffnungsträger der Republikaner betrachtet worden - er war eines der bekannten Gesichter seiner Partei in den Medien. Nun arbeitet er für den Sender Fox News.

""Bei Chaffetz geht es immer nur um Chaffetz"", sagt Boehner nun ""Politico"". Chaffetz habe politisches Talent, es aber nur genutzt, um seine eigene Karriere voranzutreiben. Der 50-Jährige sei ein ""totaler Blender"", sagt Boehner. Genauso wie Chaffetz Kongresskollege Jim Jordan, ein Republikaner, den Boehner als ""Parlamentsterroristen"" bezeichnet.

""Fuck Jordan, fuck Chaffetz"", flucht Boehner im Interview, ""sie sind beide Arschlöcher.""

Boehner über die republikanischen ""Anarchisten"" im Kongress

Nicht die einzigen im Kongress, wenn man Boehners Ausführungen glaubt. Der ehemalige Chef des Unterhauses lässt sich gegenüber ""Politico"" auch gewaltig über den sogenannten Freedom Caucus aus. In diesem haben sich die radikalsten der republikanischen Kongressabgeordneten organisiert, um eine politische Revolution von rechts voranzutreiben.

""Sie können dir nicht erklären, wofür sie eigentlich stehen"", ätzt Boehner bei ""Politico"" gegen den Freedom Caucus. ""Sie können dir nur sagen, wogegen sie sind. Sie sind Anarchisten, sie wollen totales Chaos."" Der Caucus wolle das ganze politische System zerstören.

Boehner kommt in dieser Hinsicht auch auf Donald Trump zu sprechen. Schon im Mai hatte er dessen Präsidentschaft als ""Desaster"" bezeichnet. Jetzt rolle er laut ""Politico"" mit den Augen, wenn er auf das Weiße Haus angesprochen wird.

Boehner spricht von einer ""Disfunktion"" der Regierung. Er sagt selbstironisch: ""So wie es gerade läuft, da sehe ja selbst ich wie ein Genie aus.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Mehrere republikanische Senatoren proben den Aufstand gegen Trump - der reagiert wütend

Boehner befürchtet das Ende seiner Partei

Trump hingegen sei weder ein Demokrat, noch ein Republikaner. ""Er ist ein Populist, er hat keinerlei Ideologie, der er folgt."" Für die Republikaner hat das laut Boehner schwere Folgen. Angesprochen darauf, wie seine Partei die Zeit unter Trump überstehen will, sagt er zögerlich: ""Es gibt keine Republikanische Partei."" Und es gäbe auch niemanden, der die Republikaner anführe.

Ein Mann, der dies tun könnte, wäre der umstrittene Vize-Präsident Mike Pence. Als ""loyalen Soldaten"" bezeichnet Boehner diesen, als jemanden, der durch alle Verrücktheiten zu Trump gestanden habe. Aber: ""Er und sein Team, sie halten die Augen offen."" Soll heißen: Stürzt Trump, setzt Boehner seine Hoffnungen für die Republikaner in Pence.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Trump ist eine Zumutung. Aber was nach ihm kommen könnte, wäre noch schlimmer

Und nicht in sich selbst. Mit dem politischen Leben will Boehner - trotz aller Wut über den Zustand seiner Partei - abgeschlossen haben. Rauchen, Rasenmähen, Golfen - so lässt er seinen Ruhestand von ""Politico"" darstellen. Das Magazin fragt ihn, wie die Historiker wohl auf ihn und sein politisches Lebenswerk zurückblicken werden.

Boehner sagt: ""Sie werden über das Ende des Zwei-Parteien-Systems sprechen."" Das klingt wie ein Eingeständnis: Die ""Arschlöcher"" unter den Republikanern haben gesiegt.

Indipendentista da sempre, Puigdemont non ha cercato il potere, spiega il suo amico Antoni Puigverd.
Rimasto solo, fatta eccezione per il manipolo di ex ministri che l'ha seguito a Bruxelles, Puigdemont ha scelto di tacere per tutto il giorno.
Probabilmente sa anche lui che di avere pochissime chance di diventare un rifugiato politico: i casi di asilo intra-Ue sono rarissimi e riguardano perlopiù minoranze etniche come i rom.
""Proteggere e garantire la sicurezza delle persone è la nostra priorità.","La vicenda dell'ex presidente catalano Carles Puigdemont, scappato in Belgio a elemosinare un asilo politico quasi impossibile dopo aver chiesto ai suoi di fare ""resistenza democratica"", può essere letta come la parabola dell'avventurista. I quotidiani spagnoli, ma anche quelli catalani, ne danno un giudizio inesorabile. Il suo inanellare un errore dietro l'altro ha portato la Spagna e la 'sua' Catalogna in una situazione paradossale, scatenando una crisi che solo il voto anticipato di dicembre potrà sciogliere. Il tutto per poi scappare, senza dire una parola, dai nazionalisti fiamminghi su consiglio di un altro avventurista della politica: Theo Francken, segretario di stato belga per le politiche di asilo e migrazione, già nell'occhio del ciclone per aver partecipato al novantesimo compleanno di uno dei più noti collaborazionisti fiamminghi dei nazisti durante la Seconda guerra mondiale, e per dichiarazioni ostili verso migranti e gay.

Belgium's Asylum and Migration State Secretary Theo Francken

Finisce in farsa, dunque, anche se le conseguenze politiche, in entrambi i Paesi e per l'Ue, ci sono. La Catalogna si ritrova spaccata in due, con la marea unionista che ha sfilato ieri in Plaza Catalunya a chiedere l'arresto dell'ex president, e il popolo indipendentista che si sente sempre più tradito e confuso. I commentatori catalani danno tutta la colpa all'avventurismo di Puigdemont e non gli perdonano l'ultimo 'errore': non aver avuto i nervi abbastanza saldi giovedì scorso per resistere alle pressioni degli alleati e alle sdrucciolevoli offerte di Madrid e convocare le elezioni, salvando le istituzioni catalane.

Puigdemont è entrato così nella storia come il secondo presidente catalano ad avere proclamato la Repubblica. Ma con un risultato effimero, come fu quello ottenuto da Lluis Companys nel 1934. La Repubblica allora durò 11 ore prima di essere soffocata nel sangue da Madrid. Companys venne arrestato, condannato a 30 anni, poi fucilato dal franchismo. Il president rischia la stessa fine, fucilazione a parte s'intende. La procura spagnola ha chiesto già la sua incriminazione: rischia 30 anni, nonostante la sua 'rivoluzione' sia stata tutta pacifica. I commentatori hanno visto un Puigdemont ""abbattuto"" da giovedì. Il president si è sentito tradito da tutti. Dalla piazza che lo ha fatto passare da eroe a ""traditore"" in 5 minuti, quando stava per firmare la convocazione delle elezioni. Dal suo alleato Oriol Junqueras, che l'ha messo con le spalle al muro minacciando di far cadere il governo. Dal 'nemico' Rajoy, che giovedì a mezzogiorno non lo ha chiamato per confermare lo stop al 155 promesso dal mediatore basco Urkullu.

Indipendentista da sempre, Puigdemont non ha cercato il potere, spiega il suo amico Antoni Puigverd. È diventato presidente per caso dopo la rinuncia di Artur Mas. Lo è stato con ""franchezza, empatia, naturalezza"", lo difende Puigverd. ""Certo, nel momento della verità non ha avuto i nervi d'acciaio, la punta di cinismo e il senso della realtà, la durezza dei grandi politici, figlia di ambizioni eroiche: governare il destino dei popoli"". ""Ma l'ambizione di Puigdemont - dice Puigverd - è solo essere parte della gente, della sua gente"", in mezzo alla quale si è tuffato sabato e domenica a Girona, prima di volare a Bruxelles.

Qui andrà incontro, con tutta probabilità, a un'altra porta in faccia. Già ieri sera il primo ministro belga Charles Michel aveva chiarito che l'ipotesi di concedere asilo politico a Puigdemont ""non è assolutamente all'ordine del giorno"" del governo belga. In serata anche il partito nazionalista fiammingo N-Va prende le distanze, precisando che ""se Puigdemont è a Bruxelles, non è certamente stato invitato da noi"". L'imbarazzo è evidente, sia per il presidente destituito che per il premier belga, che pure deve fare i conti con un cortocircuito interno (i nazionalisti fiamminghi rappresentano la principale forza politica a livello federale dopo le elezioni del 2014: da loro, e dai loro 31 seggi alla Camera dei rappresentanti, dipende il futuro del governo).

Rimasto solo, fatta eccezione per il manipolo di ex ministri che l'ha seguito a Bruxelles, Puigdemont ha scelto di tacere per tutto il giorno. Probabilmente sa anche lui che di avere pochissime chance di diventare un rifugiato politico: i casi di asilo intra-Ue sono rarissimi e riguardano perlopiù minoranze etniche come i rom. Per Bruxelles, concedergli l'asilo significherebbe dubitare che la Spagna sia in grado di assicurargli un processo e un trattamento equi, circostanza che creerebbe una frattura insanabile con Madrid. Per questo il governo belga è imbarazzato, e ha isolato il ministro nazionalista fiammingo che vorrebbe spezzare quel cordone di sicurezza stretto dall'Ue attorno alla questione catalana.

A uscire bene, in tutta questa vicenda, sono i Mossos d'Esquadra, la polizia regionale catalana, e il loro ormai ex comandante Josep Lluis Trapero. Accusato di sedizione e sottoposto a regime di libertà vigilata, Trapero è stato rimosso dalla guida dei Mossos. Ma invece di tentare la fuga o alimentare i contrasti, l'ex comandante ha scritto una lettera ai suoi invitandoli ""alla calma e alla comprensione"". ""Proteggere e garantire la sicurezza delle persone è la nostra priorità. Continuiamo a lavorare normalmente"", sono le sue parole.

Josep Lluis Trapero

In fuga e silente, invece, resta l'ex presidente catalano. Secondo fonti citate dalla stampa catalana, Puigdemont dovrebbe comparire domani in conferenza stampa per spiegare i motivi del suo improvviso viaggio in Belgio. Insieme a cinque ex ministri del suo govern, il president avrebbe prima viaggiato in auto fino a Marsiglia, per poi imbarcarsi alla volta della capitale d'Europa. Così facendo, ha portato nel cuore dell'Ue tutta la goffaggine e l'inadeguatezza di un leader politico che ha cavalcato una causa populista senza prima assicurarsi di aver allacciato la sella. Ma il paradosso è anche per il debole governo belga, la cui fragilità ha permesso alla 'farsa' catalana di finire proprio nel centro di un'Europa a sua volta sempre più fragile.",Finita in farsa.

zu Potte?

Die Deutschen haben einen neuen Bundestag gewählt. Er steuert wohl auf eine 4-Parteien-, eine schwarz-grün-gelbe, die sog. Jamaika-Koalition und -Regierung zu. Auf diese warten eine Fülle von Aufgaben und großen Herausforderungen, die sie für die Deutschen bewältigen sollen, Baustellen, die sie erfolgreich beackern müssen - das ist ihr demokratischer Auftrag von den Wählern.

Kommt die Jamaika-Koalition nun endlich zu ihrem Potte oder nicht?

In seiner Sprache hat ein Volk seine Weisheit und Lebenserfahrung zum Ausdruck gebracht. Was bedeutet dieser seltsame Ausdruck: „zu Potte kommen"", der in meinem letzten Blog („Nach der Wahl: Der trübe Start des deutschen Jamaika-Zirkus' und die ersten Jamaika-Witze"") etliche Male vorkommt?

Was ist des Pudels Kern?

„Zu Potte kommen"" ist eine alte deutsche Redewendung. Sie drückt aus kurz und knapp, als Bild: die anstehende, schwierige Aufgabe wurde bewältigt, erfolgreich erledigt, zu Ende gebracht, das gewünschte Ziel wurde erreicht.

Einige Beispiele

Wenn Sie den richtigen Partner gesucht und gefunden haben, dann sind Sie, kurz und knapp und mit nur 15 Zeichen „zu Potte kommen"". Haben Sie eine passende Wohnung gefunden, sind Sie auch zu Ihrem Potte gekommen. Oder haben Sie den gewünschten Job bekommen, sind Sie zu Potte gekommen. Haben Sie die Kreuzfahrt-Traum-Reise ihres Lebens angetreten, so sind sie im wahrsten Sinne auf dem Pott angekommen Und wenn die neue 3-Farben-Koalition die anstehenden schwierigen Aufgaben für das Land anpackt und erfolgreich löst, kommt sie zu Potte. Finden Sie jedoch nicht den richtigen Partner, die passende Wohnung, den gewünschten Shop oder Ihre Traumreise, sind Sie „nicht zu Potte"" gekommen. Und wenn die kommende Jamaika-Koalition die drängenden Aufgaben nicht löst, kommt sie „nicht zu Potte"".

Woher kommt diese seltsame Redewendung?

In Norddeutschland, auch in Dänemark, war und ist Pott der Ausdruck für Topf, für einen Behälter. Im übertragenen Sinn auch ein Behälter für Waren und Personen, ein Schiff oder auch eine Kneipe oder einen Farbeimer. Wer zu Potte kam, hat den richtigen Behälter für sich gefunden, fährt im richtigen Schiff und hat erfolgreich seine Aufgabe erfüllt.

Eine andere Bedeutung

Die Umgangssprache drückt sich nicht nur diskret, fein und vornehm, sondern zuweilen auch realistisch, drastisch und derb aus. Pott wird nicht nur für Topf benutzt, sondern auch für den „Boddschamber"", „das „Nachtgeschirr"" oder den Nachttopf. „Zu Topp kommen"" bedeutet in diesem Kontext in allzu menschlicher Bedrängnis ein hygienisches Verhalten: das ersehnte Ziel, den Nachttopf, erfolgreich zu erreichen. Und es schildert diskret den umgekehrten Vorfall, z.B. beim „flotten Otto"" das drängende und drückende Ziel nicht zu erreichen, zu verfehlen und damit nicht zu Potte zu kommen...

Ganz demokratisch und drastisch drückt aus „Die Koalition kommt nicht zu Potte"", dass sie die anstehenden dringenden Geschäfte nicht rechtzeitig und nicht richtig erfüllt, sie ihren eigentlichen Job verfehlt.

Fazit und Ankündigung

Eine Koalition, wie die Jamaika-Koalition in Berlin, die viele Aufgaben für das Land zu lösen hat, aber nicht aus der Knete, nicht aus den warmen Puschen kommt und nicht den Hintern hochkriegt, gibt damit Anlass für ein großes öffentliches demokratisches Gelächter. Dieses Verhalten löst neben öffentlichen Ärger aus auch ein Feuerwerk neuer Koalitions-Witze aus (folgen in weiteren Blogs).

Sie widersprechen darin der These, die Flüchtlingspolitik von Merkel sei schuld am schlechten Wahlergebnis der CDU

Auch Wochen nach der Bundestagswahl ist sich die CDU nicht einig, welchen Kurs die Partei künftig verfolgen will. Drei CDU-Abgeordnete wehren sich nun mit einem vierseitigen Dokument gegen einen Rechtsruck, berichtet die ""Welt"" am Montag.

Seit dem Wochenende zirkuliere das Papier in der Partei. Es trage den Titel ""Jenseits von konservativ und populistisch"", berichtet die ""Welt"", der das Dokument vorliegt.

Verfasser sind demnach die CDU-Bundestagsabgeordneten Andreas Nick, Marcus Weinberg und Matthias Zimmer.

""Panik ersetzt keine Politik""

Die drei Abgeordneten widersprechen in dem Papier vor allem einer These, die nach dem Wahldebakel der Union bei der Bundestagswahl oft zu hören war: Die Flüchtlingspolitik von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) sei schuld am schlechten Abschneiden bei der Wahl gewesen.

Vielmehr hätten die innerparteilichen Querelen seit 2015 Wähler verschreckt, laute das Argument der Autoren.

Eine Lehre aus den vergangenen Landtagswahlen sei: Wo die CDU rhetorisch die Mitte verlassen habe, sei es zu ""besonders empfindliche Niederlagen"" gekommen, zitiert die ""Welt"" aus dem Papier. ""Die Wählerinnen und Wähler haben weder die demonstrative Abwendung von der Politik der Bundesregierung noch die markigen Sprüche der Ausgrenzung belohnt.""

Nick, Weinberg und Zimmer halten es auch für falsch, die ""rechte Flanke"" nun zu schließen, um AfD-Wähler zurückzugewinnen, wie einige CDU- und CSU-Politiker nach der Wahl gefordert hatten.

""Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass der Wahlerfolg der AfD dort am größten war, wo die CDU selbst den Eindruck erweckt hat, die AfD habe mit ihrer Kritik an der Bundesregierung und ihren Forderungen in der Flüchtlingspolitik irgendwie recht"", heiße es in dem Papier.

Die Autoren würden nicht explizit den CDU-Landesverband in Sachsen nennen, kommentiert die ""Welt"". Dennoch sei der Bezug deutlich: ""Wer vom Weg der Tugend abkommt und damit seine Haltung verliert, der kann in Gefahr geraten. Panik ersetzt keine Politik.""

Rechtsruck in Sachsen

In Sachsen lagen nach der Wahlschlappe die Nerven blank. Die AfD war stärkste Kraft vor der CDU in dem Bundesland geworden.

Ministerpräsident Stanislaw Tillich trat zurück, dessen Wunschnachfolger Michael Kretschmer bezeichnete bei einem Treffen in Dresden vergangene Woche die CDU als ""Original der AfD"". Die Partei müsse den Rechtspopulisten die Positionen ""wieder wegnehmen, die Unionspositionen sind"".

Bei dem Treffen von 200 Mandats- und Funktionsträgern der Sachsen-CDU war der Tenor deutlich: Die CDU müsse weiter nach rechts rücken. Auch der Rücktritt von CDU-Bundesvorsitzenden Angela Merkel wurde gefordert.

Der Rechtsruck stößt aber auch in Sachsen nicht nur auf Zuspruch. Die ehemalige Dresdner CDU-Politikerin Elisabeth Galli erklärte zuletzt in der HuffPost ihren Parteiaustritt. Über den neuen Kurs sagte sie: ""Wenn man das will, verabschiedet man sich als Partei von seinen Werten.""

Unterstützung aus der Fraktion

Die Autoren des Papiers ""Jenseits von konservativ und populistisch"" sehen das ähnlich. Sie seien Teil einer Gruppe von Bundestagsabgeordneten und einflussreichen Bezirksvorsitzenden, die den konservativen Politikern in der Union widersprechen wollen, berichtet die ""Welt"" weiter.

Von mehreren CDU-Politikern erhalten Nick, Weinberg und Zimmer Rückdeckung. Die stellvertretende Fraktionsvorsitzende Sabine Weiss, lobt die Autoren.

""Eine ganz große Mehrheit in der Bundestagsfraktion sieht das genauso. Wir können das ständige Gerede einiger Weniger, die CDU sei nach links gerutscht, einfach nicht mehr hören"", sagte Weiss der ""Welt"".

Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, Sprecherin der Arbeitsgruppe Recht der Fraktion, befürwortet die Position der Autoren gegenüber der ""Welt"": ""Wir tun uns keinen Gefallen, wenn wir nach rechts rücken.""

“My Week As A Muslim,” which aired on Channel 4 this Monday, follows the journey of a white woman named Katie Freeman. As part of a social experiment, Freeman is immersed into a Pakistani Muslim family in Manchester who lived just a few miles away from her own home.

While the purpose was to start a conversation about Islamophobia, the documentary has been criticized for its methods. In order to go “undercover” in her neighborhood, Freeman’s skin was darkened, and she was given a prosthetic nose, fake teeth, and brown contact lenses. She also donned a long, flowing robe and covered her head with a scarf.

The racist origins of blackface, brownface, and other costumes stemming from cultural appropriation are well documented. The impulse to assume another ethnic group’s features often results in exaggerated, inaccurate, and even harmful stereotypes.

In this case, the apparent use of “brownface” had some critics appalled.

Okay I get what #AsAMuslim is trying to do but slapping on prosthetic make-up?! What the hell does Muslim look like? We come in all colours! — Humza Yousaf (@HumzaYousaf) October 23, 2017

Journalist Radhika Sanghani wrote in the Guardian that while highlighting the effects of Islamophobia is a worthy goal, showing a white woman “browning up” with a larger, wider nose and fake teeth is not the way to do it.

“Instead of perpetuating old cliches and focusing on physical appearance, [the documentary] could have simply followed a Muslim family with cameras, hearing from the women themselves and observing the everyday racism they experience,” Sanghani wrote. “Women of colour are already under-represented in the media – why not give them a voice and hear from them directly?”

In a parody of the documentary, British-Iraqi freelance writer Ruqaya Izzidien, flipped the roles around ― imagining what it would be like if a Muslim went “undercover” as a white man.

“Channel 4′s My Week as a Muslim was a preposterous conception from the first minute, providing a platform for racism, brownface, crude caricatures, ethnocentrism and general all-round offence,” Izzidien wrote, summarizing her opinion of the show. “It was built on the antiquated, imperialist concept that a person of colour’s word cannot be trusted; their experiences and suffering don’t exist until they are verified by a white person.”

God forbid you ask an actual Muslim woman what it's like 🙄 We're not locked away you know, how else would I be tweeting?? #MyWeekAsAMuslim — Shehnaz Khan (@shehnazkhan) October 23, 2017

The show’s producer, Fozia Khan, defended the decision in a Guardian op-ed, saying that Freeman’s appearances were changed to make her “look and feel different, so she could go unrecognised in her hometown, convincingly experience what it’s like to be a Muslim woman, integrate her into her host community and experience it from within.”

″People have suggested that we could have used a different approach – such as giving Muslim women hidden cameras to show their experiences. This has been done before, and we wanted to try something different,” Khan wrote.

Khan wrote that when Freeman started the documentary, she had negative opinions about Muslims. She reportedly felt fearful about women wearing the niqab. At one point in the documentary, she says, “You see them and you think, are they going to blow something up?” But over the course of the filming, as she has meaningful conversations and experiences with Muslims, her opinions begin to change.

Saima Alvi, the Muslim woman from Greater Manchester whose family Freeman befriended, wrote about this transformation in a blog for HuffPost. Alvi said she was initially reluctant to participate in the documentary, but decided to go through with it after being reassured that she would not be misrepresented.

Watch a trailer for the show below:

After the Manchester bombing, which happened just one day into filming the documentary, Freeman and Alvi watched the footage from the attack on television together. They were both uncertain about whether to continue.

“Katie was worried that she might become a target dressed as a Muslim woman which was an important realisation. I explained that my attire is part of my identity and I must carry on in the outside world carrying this fear,” Alvi wrote. “We both decided to continue with the further five days of filming.”

After the attack, Freeman experiences what it was like to walk through the neighborhood as a visible Muslim woman during a tense time ― feeling fearful while simply walking down the street.

No one should have to fear walking down the street every day... #MyWeekAsAMuslim pic.twitter.com/14gqQsDP1t — Channel 4 (@Channel4) October 24, 2017

“I’m just sick of it, the stuff they were shouting,” she said after being heckled on camera. “But that’s, it’s only for a few days, isn’t it? You know, and I can take this off and I’ll go back to being Katie and they probably wouldn’t even make a comment, would they? But for like, Saima, if she come here and her family came here, they’d have that abuse all the time, wouldn’t they?”

Alvi argued that Freeman’s prosthetic nose and other facial changes were meant to be a disguise ― and that the makeover was never intended to mock an ethnic group, or create a caricature.

“The programme made me realise that there are genuinely decent people out there who lack the opportunity to engage with the Muslim community,” Alvi wrote in her blog. “Thus their opinions are based on the commonplace demonisation of Muslims, which is generally perpetuated by the media. Katie was willing to learn about the environment she was immersed within and therefore changed many of her former negative opinions.”

Khan claimed that her team met and received approval of the idea from Manchester’s British Muslim Heritage Centre. But The Muslim Council of Britain, an umbrella body of over 500 Muslim organizations, told HuffPost that they wished Khan had also reached out to the national body.

“There is value in consulting national Muslim bodies for advice, over and above the individuals in the programme, as this may help the production understand the potential national impact of sensitive issues - the strength of feeling of which appears to have been underestimated,” a spokesperson said in a statement.

Zuvor waren Vorwürfe gegen Hauptdarsteller Kevin Spacey laut geworden

Der Streaming-Dienst Netflix hat angekündigt, die Erfolgsserie ""House of Cards"" nach der sechsten Staffel einzustellen.

Zuvor waren Vorwürfe gegen Hauptdarsteller Kevin Spacey bekannt geworden. Der Oscargewinner soll 1986 einen 14-Jährigen sexuell belästigt haben.

Netflix und die Produzenten von ""House of Cards"" teilten mit, sie seien ""tief beunruhigt"" von den Vorwürfen gegen Spacey. In einer gemeinsamen Mitteilung berichteten die Verantwortlichen, sie hätten die Enthüllungen um Spacey am Montag mit den Schauspielern und der Filmcrew besprochen. Spacey sei nicht auf dem Filmset gewesen.

Die Entscheidung, die Serie einzustellen, sei allerdings schon vor Monaten gefallen, sagte eine Person, die mit der Situation vertraut sei, der Nachrichtenagentur AP.

Spacey outete sich als schwul

Schauspieler Anthony Rapp hatte Spacey in einem Interview eines sexuellen Übergriffs beschuldigt. Er selbst sei bei den Vorgängen 14 Jahre alt gewesen, Spacey schon 26.

Spacey habe ihn im Jahr 1986 nach einer Party in seinem New Yorker Apartment auf sein Bett gelegt und sei auf ihn gestiegen, sagte der heute 46-jährige Rapp dem Magazin ""Buzzfeed News"". Er habe sich aus der Umklammerung ""herauswinden"" können und die Wohnung verlassen. Auf Twitter antwortete Spacey, er könne sich an den Vorfall ""ehrlich nicht erinnern"".

Spacey nahm die Vorwürfe zum Anlass, sich als schwul zu outen. ""Ich habe mein ganzes Leben über Männer geliebt und romantische Begegnungen mit ihnen gehabt, und jetzt entscheide ich mich dafür, als schwuler Mann zu leben"", schrieb der Oscarpreisträger in der Nacht zu Montag auf Twitter.

Am Montag haben sich die Ereignisse in der Russland-Affäre des Weißen Hauses überschlagen

Die 5 wichtigsten Enthüllungen im Überblick

Es war still geworden. Über Wochen hatte sich in der Russland-Affäre des Weißen Haus wenig getan.

Dann überschlugen sich am Montag die Meldungen. Bereits am Wochenende hatte sich angekündigt, dass die ersten Anklagen für ehemalige und derzeitige Wahlkampf-Helfer von US-Präsident Donald Trump an diesem Tag erfolgen würden.

► Darum geht es: Mitgliedern des Trump-Teams wird vorgeworfen, sich illegal mit Personen aus Russland während des Wahlkampfes abgesprochen zu haben, um die Wahl zu manipulieren.

► Im Zentrum der aktuellen Entwicklungen stehen drei Personen: Trumps ehemaliger Wahlkampfchef, der Unternehmer und Lobbyist Paul Manafort, dessen Geschäftspartner Rick Gates und der Ex-Berater George Papadopoulos.

Während das Weiße Haus betont, die aktuellen Vorwürfe würden sich auf die Zeit vor dem Wahlkampf beziehen - was für Manafort und Gates stimmt -, wächst der Druck auf Trump dennoch. Die Russland-Ermittlungen könnten zur Gefahr für den Präsidenten werden.

Hier ein Überblick über die Ereignisse am Montag:

1. Zwölf schwere Anklagepunkte gegen Manafort und Gates

Wichtig festzuhalten ist: Die Anklageschrift des Sonderermittlers Robert Mueller gegen Manafort und Gates hat nichts mit Donald Trump und einer möglichen Zusammenarbeit seines Wahlkampf-Teams mit Russland zu tun.

Dennoch: Die Vorwürfe gegen die beiden Geschäftsmänner sind ernst.

Ihnen wird vorgeworfen, zwischen 206 und 2015 heimlich für ausländische Regierungen gearbeitet zu haben. Manafort und Gates sollen Lobbyarbeit in den USA für die Kreml-nahe Regierung von Wiktor Janukowitsch, zwischen 2010 bis 2014 Präsident in der Ukraine, betrieben haben.

Lobbyarbeit für ausländische Regierungen muss in den USA registriert werden. Meiden Personen bewusst die Registrierung, ist das Betrug - und kann mit einer Haftstrafe geahndet werden.

Weiter wird Manafort und Gates vorgeworfen, die Bezahlung ihrer Lobbyarbeit über im Ausland tätige Banken vertuscht zu haben. Dabei soll es sich um eine Summe um über 75 Millionen Dollar handeln.

Die Anklage von Mueller zählt auch auf, wofür Manafort das Geld ausgab: ein Leben im Luxus. 934,350 Dollar soll Manafort etwa in einem Geschäft für kunstvolle Teppiche in Virgina ausgegeben haben.

Einer der zwölf Anklagepunkte lautet zudem: ""Verschwörung gegen die USA"". Das muss nicht bedeuten, dass sich Manafort mit einer ausländischen Regierung verschworen hat. Vielmehr bedeute dieser Punkt, dass Manaforts und Gates Vergehen über herkömmliche Verbrechen hinausgingen, die gegen die US-Regierung gerichtet sind, erklärt das US-Politikwebseite ""Vox"".

Die Anklageschrift hat zunächst also wenig mit Donald Trump persönlich zu tun - sie wirft dennoch ein äußerst zweifelhaftes Licht auf sein Wahlkampf-Team.

2. Die dubiosen Personen in Trumps Umfeld

Denn mit der veröffentlichten Anklageschrift vom Montag wird deutlich, mit welch zwielichtigen Personen sich der Wahlkämpfer Trump umgab. Die Anklagepunkte zeichnen von Manafort das Bild eines korrupten Geschäftsmanns, der seit vielen Jahren russische Interesse vertritt.

Hinzukommt, dass Manafort zwischen März bis August 2016 als Wahlkampfleiter eine zentrale Rolle in der Kampagne von Donald Trump einnahm.

Da stellt sich die Frage: Was wusste Trump über Manaforts Vergangenheit? Der US-Sender CNN stellt zwei Thesen auf - und beide lassen Trump nicht gut aussehen:

► Trump wusste von Manaforts dubiosen Geschäften - und es war ihm egal.

► Oder er wusste nichts von dessen Vergangenheit, die laut CNN ein offenes Geheimnis ein Washington gewesen sei - und gab ihm trotzdem einen zentralen Posten in seinem Wahlkampf-Team.

Als Mitte August 2016 bekannt wurde, dass Manafort 12,7 Millionen Dollar auf illegalem Weg von Janukowitsch erhalten hatte, trat er als Wahlkampfleiter zurück.

Gates war noch länger Teil von Trumps Umfeld und soll weiterhin auch das Weiße Haus besucht haben.

Beide, Manafort und Gates, plädierten am Montag auf nicht schuldig. Ein Gericht ordnete am Montag Hausarrest für Manafort an.

Ein anderer Wahlkämpfer von Trump bekannte sich stattdessen schuldig.

3. Berater Papadopoulos bekennt sich zu Falschaussage

Wahlkampfberater George Papadopoulos hatte gegenüber dem FBI zugegeben, eine Falschaussage gemacht zu haben. Das wurde ebenfalls am Montag bekannt.

Papadopoulos hatte beim FBI falsche Angaben über den Zeitpunkt seines Kontaktes mit einem ausländischen Professor gemacht.

Aus Papadopoulos Schuldbekenntnis geht hervor, dass der Professor den Berater erst kontaktierte, nachdem Papadopoulos Teil des Trump-Teams war. Der Professor versprach demnach, ""Schmutz"" aus Russland gegen Trumps Rivalin Hillary Clinton liefern zu können.

Das Team von Donald Trump betont, dass Papadopoulos nur eine kleine Beraterrolle innegehabt habe.

Dennoch zeigt die Enthüllung vom Monta: Teile des Trump-Teams versuchten, schädliche Informationen gegen Clinton zu sammeln. Auch Trumps Sohn Donald Trump Jr. traf sich mit einer russischen Anwältin, nachdem ihm solche Informationen versprochen worden waren.

Und so könnte die Enthüllung über Papadopoulus noch zu einem ""größeren Problem für Trump als Manaforts Anklage"" werden, kommentiert der US-Sender CNN.

4. Wird sich Manafort gegen Trump wenden?

Wie gefährlich sind die aktuellen Entwicklungen für Trump selbst? Zunächst dürften die Ereignisse vom Montag keine unmittelbaren Auswirkungen auf den US-Präsidenten haben.

Allerdings besteht die Möglichkeit, dass sich Manafort gegen Trump wendet - um Schaden von sich abzuwenden. Das vermutet etwa der US-Rechtsexperte und ehemalige Bundesstaatsanwalt Renato Mariotti.

This is consistent with an early indictment to get Manafort to flip. https://t.co/GkyIb53UZ7 — Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) 30. Oktober 2017

Auch über Papadopoulos vermuten US-Medien, dass er bereits mit Sonderermittler Mueller zusammenarbeitet.

5. Mueller stochert tief

Und so bleibt die Gefahr, dass Trump womöglich über die Russland-Affäre stolpert. Die 31-seitige Anklageschrift gegen Manafort zeigt, wie gründlich Sonderermittler Mueller in der Sache vorgeht.

Der ehemalige FBI-Direktor hat dutzende Dokumente aus dem Weißen Haus und auch Finanzdokumente von Trump selbst angefordert.

Auch enge Trump-Vertraute stehen im Verdacht, ihre Fühler nach Russland ausgestreckt zu haben. Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner und Sohn Donald Jr. gerieten in die Schlagzeilen, nachdem bekannt geworden war, dass sie sich im Wahlkampf mit einer russischen Anwältin getroffen hatten - in der Hoffnung, belastende Informationen über Clinton zu erhalten.

Dieser Montag bedeutet einen großen Fortschritt in der Ermittlung von Mueller - der Tag macht aber auch deutlich, dass die Untersuchung noch lange nicht zu Ende ist. Die Russland-Affäre dürfte Trumps Präsidentschafts weiter überschatten.

Gefährlich wird es für Trump, wenn er versucht, den Schatten des Ermittlers loszuwerden. Sollte der Präsident Sonderermittler Mueller entlassen, könnte das als Behinderung der Justiz gewertet werden - und womöglich in einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren vor dem US-Kongress enden.

GORAKHPUR, Uttar Pradesh — Jaanvi Devi is terrified for her children every minute of the day.

The 32-year-old mother believes that her seven-year-old daughter Anchal and her four-year-old son Alok are risking their lives as long as they stay in Manbela village on the outskirts of Gorakhpur city.

Jaanvi's dilemma is that she has no way of leaving the village, which has been a hotbed of encephalitis, a deadly inflammation of the brain that kills hundreds of children in Uttar Pradesh, every year. The villagers call it ""brain fever"".

The soft-spoken woman with flawless skin and deep-set eyes, said, ""We live in terror every day. I feel afraid all the time. My children could be dead tomorrow and there is nothing I can do about it.""

""The fear never goes away,"" she said, pressing her chest. ""There is always a heaviness in the heart that something bad is going to happen.""

Jaanvi's remarks gave me a moment of pause. After a week of interviews, it was the first time I heard someone evoke pure terror while talking about encephalitis. The young mother's fears, however, are neither exaggerated nor farfetched.

Encephalitis does, in fact, kill four times the number of people that die in terror attacks in India every year. But there is little talk of the crisis that is consuming children from the poorest communities, enfeebled by malnutrition, poor hygiene and unsanitary living conditions.

In India, terror attacks claimed 289, 416 and 404 lives in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively, according to the Global Terrorism Index. In the same years, encephalitis killed 1,475 (2013), 2,012 (2014) and 1,501 (2015), the vast majority of them in UP.

When I asked her why she was terrified of encephalitis, Jaanvi said, ""It's like we are surrounded by death. It's only a matter of time before it strikes. Today, it is the family down the street. Tomorrow, it could be us.""

It's like we are surrounded by death. It's only a matter of time before it strikes.

Jaanvi said she didn't want to be counted among the mothers of Manbela village who have lost their children to ""brain fever.""

One of those grieving mothers is Champta Devi, who lost her daughter, Yashoda, three years ago.

""I was angry for a long time but I have nothing to say anymore. There's no point in being angry if you are poor. No one cares about us and nothing changes for us,"" she said.

Vidya Devi, who lost her seven-year-old son during the rainy season last year, is still inconsolable. ""He was alive in the morning and dead by the evening,"" she said.

While Champta and Vidya continue mourning their children, two other mothers, Ramvati Devi and Lalti Devi, spend day and night taking care of their daughters, who are living with crippling mental and physical disabilities that often follow encephalitis.

As she helped her children out of their school uniforms, Jaanvi said, ""I don't know who is suffering more: the mothers whose children are dead or the mothers who will have to help them defecate all their lives.""

He was alive in the morning and dead by the evening.

READ: In Uttar Pradesh, 'Surviving Encephalitis Could Be Worse Than Dying Of It'

Stuck in Manbela

Encephalitis has terrorised eastern UP for almost four decades, with one government after another at the Centre and in the state playing the part of a bystander.

Over 11,000 people have died of encephalitis in the past seven years alone. Not only have the authorities failed to roll out an effective vaccination programme, nothing has been done to combat the unsanitary living conditions that become havens for mosquitoes carrying the Japanese encephalitis virus found in pigs and wild birds.

Take, for instance, Manbela village, home mostly to daily wage labourers from the lower castes, located in the constituency of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and just a few kilometres away from the Baba Raghav Das Medical College, the largest government hospital in the district.

Even though it is just a half-hour drive from the grand temple complex that Adityanath presides over, Manbela is choking in its own filth and swarming with mosquitoes. Almost everyone in the village defecates in the open, mostly in the fields surrounding their houses.

But sanitation workers rarely visit to either clean or fumigate the village.

The villagers told me they recently had the opportunity to complain about the unsanitary living conditions to three officials from Delhi, who visited them after the BRD Medical College made national news for running out of liquid oxygen on August 12.

Gujrati Devi, the village matriarch, recalled, ""We all gathered under the tree by the temple. They asked us, 'Does someone come to clean the drains?' We said no. They asked us, 'does anyone come to kill the mosquitoes? 'We said no. They asked us, 'Do you have toilets?' We said no.""

""There was someone who was writing everything in her notebook like you are but then she went away and nothing changed,"" said Gujrati.

On one sweltering afternoon and during a power outage, Jaanvi explained her desperation to leave Manbela village and the two obstacles in her path: money and her in-laws.

""You can see that we are keeping our house clean but the outside is disgusting. I blame everyone who throws garbage in the drains and the streets,"" she said. ""You don't have to wait till nightfall to see the mosquitoes — just till four in the evening. It takes one mosquito to kill but here we have thousands.""

You don't have to wait till nightfall to see the mosquitoes - just till four in the evening.

While Jaanvi and Ajay, her husband, agree about leaving Manbela, they cannot make the move on the ₹5000 he earns working in an auto agency. ""The bigger problem is my husband's parents. They refuse to move from here and we cannot leave them behind. It would break their hearts,"" she said.

It's not that Jaanvi's in-laws don't know about the encephalitis threat. ""They have seen the deaths in the village but they don't understand why sanitation is important. If I push too much, it creates tension in the house and even my husband tells me to stop,"" she said.

And what about vaccination? While the state government claims to have launched a vaccination drive for 88 lakh children in the summer this year, neither Jaanvi nor her husband heard about the drive despite their proximity to the city and the medical college. ""There was no talk about it in the village. Do you know when is the next one? How can we find out about it?"" she asked.

Fighting back

During one of our conversations, Jaanvi recalled both the joy she experienced attending school and the heartbreak of forsaking her education. Instead of making a fuss, she quietly quit school, married the man that her father chose and went to live with her husband in Manbela village.

Over the course of her 32 years, Jaanvi has made her peace with other people making the important decisions of her life, but she refuses to accommodate the grim threat of encephalitis.

Even though she has failed to move her children out of Manbela village, Jaanvi is still fighting back. In a voice ringing with pride, the young mother narrated how she persuaded her husband to build a toilet as well as a bathing area inside the house.

""It's the only way to protect the children against mosquitoes. Defecating in the open is disgusting especially during the monsoon when the fields are filled with water. There are mosquitoes that bite when you squat,"" she said.

Defecating in the open is disgusting especially during the monsoon when the fields are filled with water.

Jaanvi's house is among the handful in Manbela village that have a toilet. Ajay says it cost them ₹80,000 to build both the toilet and the bath.

In addition to borrowing ₹30,000 from his relatives in Kanpur, Ajay also availed of the Modi's government's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to build the toilet in his house. He is still waiting for the government to transfer funds into his bank account.

""I received the initial ₹2,000 in July but ₹6,000 is still pending,"" he said. ""I really don't know how we are going to afford this.""

At this point in the conversation, Jaanvi reassured her husband that their children's health was worth any financial trouble they face. ""I have realised we have to protect our children. I don't think anyone else will help us,"" she said.

20.53 Uhr: Zweites Opfer des Herbststurms

""Herwart"" hat sein zweites Todesopfer in Deutschland gefordert. Auf dem Peenestrom in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern war am Sonntag ein Motorboot mit drei Urlaubern aus Sachsen gekentert. Eine ins Krankenhaus gebrachte Frau starb inzwischen, wie ein Polizeisprecher in Neubrandenburg am Abend mitteilte.

Rettungskräfte hatten die Frau und einen Mann in der Nähe von Wolgast zunächst bergen können. Die beiden waren trotz Sturmwarnung auf den Peenestrom, der zur Ostsee führt, hinausgefahren. Die Suche nach einem dritten Passagier blieb nach Angaben der Beamten auch nach rund fünf Stunden erfolglos.

13.57 Uhr: Camper von Sturmflut überrascht und ertrunken

Ein 63-Jähriger ist am Ufer des Jadebusens (Niedersachsen) von der Sturmflut überrascht worden und ertrunken.

Der Mann habe den Ermittlungen zufolge mit seinem Bruder auf einem Campingplatz am Strandbad Sehestedt in einem Bulli übernachten und sich beim Herannahen des Wassers zu Fuß in Sicherheit bringen wollen, teilte die Polizei am Sonntag mit.

13:33 Uhr: Bahn nimmt Fernverkehr erst wieder am Montag auf

Sturm ""Herwart"" hat auf den Strecken der Deutschen Bahn im Norden und Osten für erhebliche Schäden gesorgt.

Wegen starker Windböen in Frankfurt musste am Sonntag ein Airbus A380 der Lufthansa außerplanmäßig in Stuttgart landen.

Nachdem die aus Houston (USA) kommende Maschine einige Zeit über dem Flughafen Frankfurt gekreist war, entschied sich der Kapitän zur Sicherheitslandung in der baden-württembergischen Landeshauptstadt, auch weil Treibstoff knapp wurde.

Der SWR hatte zunächst darüber berichtet. Ein Sprecher des Flughafens Stuttgart sagte, das Flugzeug sei sicher gelandet. Ein Sprecher der Lufthansa bestätigte das ebenfalls.

9:48 Uhr: Feuerwehr fährt 550 Sturm-Einsätze in Hamburg

Etwa 550 Mal ist die Hamburger Feuerwehr ausgerückt. Mittlerweile würden die Orkanböen nachlassen, was die Einsätze der Feuerwehr erheblich erleichtere, sagte ein Feuerwehrsprecher. Verletzt wurde bislang niemand, erklärte ein Polizeisprecher.

Auch in den Kreisen Pinneberg, Dithmarschen und Steinburg kam die Feuerwehr laut einer Mitteilung bisher auf insgesamt 230 Einsätze. Der Sturm habe zahlreiche Bäume auf Straßen, Wege, Fahrzeuge und Häuser gekippt.

En entrevue avec Saratoga sur le tapis rouge de la célébration de l'ADISQ, dimanche, il a fallu que Michel-Olivier Gasse attire notre attention sur le discret ventre arrondi de sa douce pour qu'on réalise que celle-ci était enceinte. Lorsque nous avons demandé au couple s'il planchait présentement sur du nouveau matériel (musical), le musicien a pointé le bedon et clamé la bonne nouvelle.

«Notre nouveau matériel, c'est ça, pour l'instant», a-t-il déclaré, amusé.

Chantal Archambault donnera ainsi naissance à une fillette lorsque le printemps se pointera le bout du nez. «À moins que ça change à la dernière minute, on ne sait jamais», a rigolé l'auteure-compositrice- interprète, à propos du sexe du chérubin.

Michel-Olivier Gasse et Chantal Archambault partagent leur quotidien depuis cinq ans.

«On s'aime depuis plus longtemps que ça, mais officiellement, ça fait cinq ans», a précisé Michel-Olivier Gasse.

En tournée

Les deux membres de Saratoga ne savent pas encore s'ils vont s'offrir l'été de congé avec leur poupon ou s'ils continueront d'offrir des spectacles entre deux biberons. Chantal Archambault a mentionné qu'il y aura «peut-être des petites affaires» pour eux dans la prochaine année, mais que son compagnon et elle abordaient la suite de façon «bien relaxe».

D'ici là, toutefois, on aura maintes occasions d'applaudir leur jolie musique pleine de poésie. Saratoga se produira notamment au Club Soda le 4 novembre, dans le cadre de Coup de cœur francophone, partira en tournée canadienne en novembre et s'arrêtera au Cercle, à Québec, le 9 décembre.

Archambault et Gasse menaient des carrières chacun de son côté – elle a lancé quatre opus en solo, lui a longtemps été le complice de Vincent Vallières, en plus d'avoir jadis accompagné sa belle sur scène à la basse, et a publié deux romans -, avant de s'unir pour faire route ensemble professionnellement il y a trois ans. Leur premier disque complet, Fleur, est en vente depuis le 14 octobre 2016.

Au Gala de l'ADISQ, cette année, ils étaient cités dans les catégories Album de l'année – Folk (où ils se sont inclinés devant Avec pas d'casque et leur projet Effets spéciaux) et Révélation de l'année (où c'est finalement Émile Bilodeau qui a raflé les honneurs). Or, les deux artistes ne se créaient aucune attente et étaient simplement contents de vivre cet événement pour la première fois.

Ce que Spacey a dû affronter pendant des années est vraiment triste.","Kevin Spacey fait son coming out et s'excuse d'avances inappropriées dont on l'accuse

PEOPLE - La réponse a été immédiate. En début de soirée ce dimanche 29 octobre, l'acteur Anthony Rapp a accusé Kevin Spacey de lui avoir fait des avances alors qu'il n'avait que 14 ans il y a de ça 31 ans. Quelques instants plus tard le comédien star de la série ""House of Cards"" s'est excusé et a saisi l'occasion pour mettre fin aux longues rumeurs sur sa sexualité en faisant son coming out.

Dans une interview à BuzzFeed, Anthony Rapp (actuellement dans ""Star Trek: Discovery"") a raconté que lorsqu'il était adolescent et se produisait à Broadway en 1986, il a rencontré Kevin Spacey qui était alors âgé de 26 ans. Rapp et un ami à lui finissaient un repas avec leur troupe de théâtre quand Spacey les a invités à le rejoindre dans un club de Manhattan.

Rapp dit avoir passé une bonne soirée, bien qu'il ne se rappelle pas comment il ait pu entrer dans les lieux alors qu'il était mineur, et avoir donc accepté de participer à une fête organisée par Spacey, alors peu connu, chez lui quelques jours plus tard.

""Il essayait de me séduire""

Lors de cette nouvelle soirée, l'adolescent s'est rapidement rendu compte qu'il n'y avait que des adultes présents et s'est vite ennuyé. Il s'est installé dans la chambre pour regarder la télévision. Plus tard, Kevin Spacey l'y a rejoint et Anthony Rapp dit alors avoir compris que la fête était terminé. Il assure qu'il était sur le point de partir quand le jeune homme, qui avait l'air soûl, l'a pris dans ses bras, l'a allongé sur le lit et lui est tombé dessus.

""Il essayait de me séduire. Je ne sais pas si c'est ce que je me suis dit sur le moment mais je me rendais compte qu'il tentait quelque chose de sexuel"", affirme Rapp qui explique s'être dégagé après être resté figé quelques instants. ""Je suis allé dans la salle de bain, j'ai vu une photo de lui enlaçant un homme, je me suis dit 'ah, il est gay', je suis sorti et je lui ai dit 'je crois que je vais y aller'. Il a marché avec moi jusqu'à la porte d'entrée et m'a demandé si je voulais vraiment partir. Je lui ai répondu 'oui, bonne nuit"" et j'ai quitté les lieux"".

Rapp explique longuement ne pas avoir su quoi penser de ces avances, et que le malaise est devenu de plus en plus fort quand des années plus tard Spacey est devenu célèbre et a commencé à apparaître sur grand écran régulièrement. ""Si j'étais à une soirée, que tout à coup je voyais Kevin Spacey et qu'il venait me parler, comment est-ce que je réagirais? Aujourd'hui encore je ne sais pas"", conclut le comédien de 46 ans.

""Je suis horrifié par cette histoire""

Kevin Spacey, maintenant âgé de 58 ans, a très rapidement commenté ce récit sur son compte Twitter: ""J'ai énormément de respect pour Anthony Rapp, je suis horrifié par cette histoire. En toute honnêteté, je ne me rappelle pas de cette rencontre, cela se serait déroulé il y a plus de 30 ans.""

""Mais si je me suis comporté de la façon dont il l'a décrite, je lui dois mes excuses les plus sincères pour ce qui aurait été un moment d'ébriété totalement inapproprié. Je suis désolé du ressenti que cela lui a coûté pour les nombreuses années qui ont suivi, comme il le raconte"", écrit l'acteur.

""Cela m'encourage a évoquer un autre élément de ma vie qui a fait l'objet de nombreuses rumeurs car je suis très attaché à ma vie privée. Les personnes qui sont les plus proches de moi savent que j'ai eu des relations amoureuses avec des hommes et des femmes par le passé, et que je me considère maintenant comme gay. Je veux maintenant être honnête et ouvert sur le sujet et cela commence par confronter mon propre comportement"", conclut Kevin Spacey.

Le mélange de ces excuses concernant des avances sur un mineur et d'un coming out n'a pas été bien reçu par de nombreuses personnalités et membres de la communauté LGBT qui se battent justement pour éviter les amalgames.

""Non, non, non, non, non! Tu ne peux pas ""choisir"" de te cacher sous l'arc-en-ciel! Va te faire voir!"", a notamment réagit l'actrice lesbienne Wanda Sykes.

(Cette façon de faire son coming out) remet la communauté LGBT au centre de vieilles critiques et amalgames. Comme oses-tu nous impliquer tous là-dedans"", s'indigne un journaliste de Vanity Fair.

A Swiss couple was so traumatized after being assaulted by a group of boys in Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh that they refused to file an FIR, according to an NDTV report. The channel reported that while the woman was forced to take selfies with the minor boys, her male companion was beaten up badly, leading him with a cracked skull.

The shameful incident, one of many against foreign tourists who come to India to experience the country's famous hospitality, four days ago, sent political shockwaves on a day the Chief Minister of the state also visited the Taj Mahal on a cleanliness drive.

IANS reported that Marie Droz was discharged from Delhi's Apollo Hospital yesterday and her companion Quentin Jeremy Clerc's condition was improving, even as five persons, including three minors, were taken into custody for the crime. Yogi Adityanath promised strict action and better security.

The Swiss embassy in New Delhi confirmed the October 22 attack and said it was providing them consular services. The couple was walking alongside a train track in Fatehpur Sikri near Agra when the youths started harassing them.

Senior Superintendent of Police Agra, Amit Pathak, said late on Thursday evening that five persons, including three minors, have been taken into custody for the crime.

Sushma Swaraj sought a report from the Uttar Pradesh government on the assault. Minister of State for Tourism K.J. Alphons expressed deep concern.

""You would kindly appreciate that such incidents negatively impact our image and are detrimental to our efforts in promoting India as a tourism destination,"" Alphons told the Chief Minister in a letter.

He said a ""fast and speedy response in identifying and ensuring speedy action including conviction of the guilty would be reassuring"" and would send a ""good message of our efforts to prevent recurrence of such incidents"".

Police took the Swiss couple to a private hospital in Agra where first aid was given.

Adityanath said touts and anti-social elements who bring a bad name to Agra and the country would be firmly dealt with. Providing security to tourists would be a top priority.

Meanwhile, CPI-M leader Brinda Karat wrote to the Swiss envoy in India expressing ""strong protest"" over the ""failure"" of the authorities to provide minimum security to tourists in a wider area that houses the Taj Mahal, India's biggest tourists draw.

""As a citizen of India, I am writing to you to express my deep regret at the shocking and horrifying violence that two young Swiss nationals ... had to face on their trip to Agra and Fatehpur Sikri. It is shameful for us as Indians that two young tourists who had gone to visit the beautiful symbol of love should have to face this horror. Please convey our very best wishes for their speedy recovery,"" she said.

— Tamara Malcolm (@TamaraMStory) October 29, 2017""Please help me bring my kids home,"" Malcolm wrote on the GoFundMe page, which has a fundraising goal of $50,000.","""Please help.""

With a simple plea, an Indigenous woman who says she's been fighting to get her three children back from Manitoba's child welfare system for 10 years lays out her next plan.

Tamara Malcolm, who currently lives in Ontario's Serpent River First Nation with her husband, young daughter and oldest son, started a GoFundMe page this month to raise money to hire a lawyer and explore her options ""for a legal case against those responsible for the negligence in my, and my children's, case.""

As of Monday, Malcolm had raised $2,870, which she wrote on Twitter that she'd used to retain Toronto lawyer and First Nations advocate Katherine Hensel. With the help of Hensel and the financial support raised on her page, Malcolm will be suing the agencies responsible for keeping her children from her, Hensel told HuffPost Canada in an interview.

Malcolm, 34, has had ""her life in order for many years,"" Hensel said. She has a ""healthy home and family,"" and that's been known to the children's aid authorities in Winnipeg for quite some time, Hensel added.

Yet Malcolm's children have ""languished"" in foster care for a decade, she added, where they've been separated from each other, and denied their family and cultural upbringing.

These children will spend the rest of their lives recovering from their childhood. Lawyer Katherine Hensel

They have two legal objectives, Hensel said. First, to return Malcolm's two youngest boys to her care (the eldest aged out of the system and moved back home). Second, to redress and remedy the ""very real harm and trauma"" that's been caused by the actions of the state, she said.

""These children will spend the rest of their lives recovering from their childhood,"" Hensel said.

""This case represents much of what's wrong with child welfare and child protection in Manitoba and across the county when it comes to Indigenous children and their families,"" Hensel said.

A common case

A spokesperson for the Manitoba government told HuffPost Canada that they cannot provide specific information about a child in their care.

But they noted that child safety is ""paramount"" under the Child and Family Services Act and that children are only taken into care when there are serious safety concerns that can't be resolved without removing the child.

""When children are apprehended, the first priority for agencies is to fully assess reunification with the parents or guardians. Children can be reunified with their parents at any time while they are in care,"" the province said in an emailed statement.

""Establishing lifelong connections is critical to achieving the best outcomes for children in care. This is a fundamental element of the reforms recently announced by this Government.""

There are about 11,000 children in care in Manitoba, which is the highest rate in the country, CBC previously reported. Almost 90 per cent of those children are of ""Indigenous descent."" Over one in five First Nations children in Manitoba spends some time in care before they turn 15 years old, noted research in a previous HuffPost Canada blog.

It's extraordinarily tragic, but it happens to many, many families. Lawyer Katherine Hensel

Earlier in October, the Manitoba government promised to reduce the number of indigenous children in provincial care.

""This is not an extraordinary case. In fact, it's quite ordinary. It's extraordinarily tragic, but it happens to many, many families, "" Hensel said about Malcolm's case.

""What makes Ms. Malcolm exceptional is in her ability to muster resources and the relentlessness and energy with which she's advocated for the return of her children.""

A violent history

Malcolm's three sons were apprehended in 2007 by Child and Family Services in Winnipeg, Malcolm wrote on her GoFundMe page. At the time, she was in an abusive relationship with her ex-partner, who also later discovered was also violent with her son, Malcolm wrote.

""I immediately cut off contact with him when he hurt my child and have not seen or heard from him in 10 years, it is my boys and me who continue to pay the price,"" Malcolm wrote.

""My two younger boys remain in foster care and there is no need for them to be. I am a business owner (Bea Beads), a traditional person who practices my culture, I am clean and sober and dedicated to my family,"" she wrote.

""Please help me""

Malcolm's two youngest sons are now 14 and 10 years old, Hensel confirmed.

In the last 10 years I've been told by workers and legal aid lawyers to give up. How could I? My children are my world and always will be. — Tamara Malcolm (@TamaraMStory) October 29, 2017

""Please help me bring my kids home,"" Malcolm wrote on the GoFundMe page, which has a fundraising goal of $50,000.

""[It's] been 10 years. [It's] been long enough. I just want my kids home and together.""

If tax cuts boost growth, tax increases should stall the economy.","""Mr. Fraser and the those arguing for lower taxes for corporations and the rich should be reminded: fiscal policy can make the difference in tackling inequality.""

Treasury secretary John Fraser recently backed the Coalition's company tax cuts at a Senate estimates hearing. In light of similar moves across the rest of the world, he said, ""I'm not going to say we don't live on an island because clearly we do, but we are obviously part of the world economy"".

He further argued, ""It is a cost of doing business. If Australia is to remain competitive we have to be mindful of what is happening elsewhere"". He feared President Trump's proposed tax cuts ""run the risk of sucking in a lot of capital flows that might have gone elsewhere"".

With respect, Mr Fraser is wrong and seeing only one side of the ledger. He sees tax as simply a cost to business. But he does not mention that tax is needed to provide world-class infrastructure to support business, and first-rate educational facilities and healthcare system to ensure supply of well-trained, healthy workforce. They significantly boost productivity and lower business cost.

No wonder, therefore, rigorous empirical studies done at two premier capitalist organisations -- the OECD and the IMF -- failed to find much evidence of supposed growth effects of tax cuts.

For example, the OECD noted:

""...it is not always clear that a tax reduction is required (or is able) to attract FDI. Where a higher corporate tax burden is matched by well-developed infrastructure, public services and other host country attributes attractive to business... tax competition from relatively low-tax countries not offering similar advantages may not seriously affect location choice. Indeed, a number of large OECD countries with relatively high effective tax rates are very successful in attracting FDI.""

A recent IMF modelling exercise of President Trump's proposed personal income tax cuts concluded:

""...the supply side [growth] effects are never large enough to offset the revenue loss from lower marginal tax rates."" On the other hand, they ""significantly worsen income polarization, even after taking into account trickle-down effects.""

The IMF in its October 2017 Fiscal Monitor reported that after analysing tax rates in OECD countries between 1981 and 2015, it found no strong correlation between lower taxes and higher growth. The IMF's findings have been highlighted even by The Economist, which is well-known for its pro-business stance.

Often cited U.S. examples of Reagan or Bush tax cuts to promote lower tax rates are nothing but myths. Admitted by President Reagan's former chief economist, Martin Feldstein, the vast majority of growth during the Reagan era was due to expansionary monetary policy that slashed interest rates massively to help the economy bounce back from a severe recession in 1982.

Increased defence spending and an expanded labour force due to an influx of baby boomers also boosted the economy. In another study with Doug Elmendorf, the former Congressional Budget Office Director, Martin Feldstein found no evidence that the 1981 tax cuts got people to work more.

The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts also failed to spur growth. Between 2001 and 2007 the economy grew at a lacklustre pace -- real per-capita income rose by 1.5 percent annually, compared to 2.3 percent during 1950-2001. Interestingly, the two sectors that grew noticeably were housing and finance, which did not gain from the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.

Moreover, by 2006, prime-age males were working the same hours as in 2000 before the tax cuts, and women were working less -- both facts inconsistent with the view that lower tax rates raise labour supply.

Mr. Fraser's one-sided view about taxes and apprehension about investment fleeing to low tax countries can best be refuted again by looking at the recent tax cut experiments in several U.S. states with little obvious success.

The most infamous case is Kansas; Governor Sam Brownback promised that a moderate tax cut for individuals and a big tax cut for businesses would be ""like a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy"".

Unfortunately, however, despite the 2012 tax cuts, the Kansas economy remained moribund, while the neighbouring states surged ahead. In the process, the Kansas state's budget has been in tatters. The Republican-led state legislature reversed much of Brownback's tax cuts earlier this year in the face of poor growth and spending needs.

If tax cuts boost growth, tax increases should stall the economy. But, President Clinton's tax increase in 1993 tells a different story. It didn't stall growth; instead, it shows that higher taxes on high-income households need not hamper faster economic growth.

Mr. Fraser is either genuinely ignorant of these overwhelming facts, or is deliberately blinded by some defunct ideology and regards them as 'fake'.

The race to the bottom tax competition simply cannot make an economy stronger and resilient. Like competitive devaluation of exchange rates in the hope of boosting exports, this 'beggar thy neighbour' policy, instead harms the country itself. It not only damages its productive capacity, but also worsens income distribution, a significant factor behind the rise of populism.

Mr. Fraser and the those arguing for lower taxes for corporations and the rich should be reminded of what the IMF has tried to persuade in its October 2017 Fiscal Monitor: fiscal policy can make the difference in tackling inequality; and that efficiency and equity must go hand-in-hand.",Tax Cuts For Big Business Won't Stimulate The Economy,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/anis-chowdhury/tax-cuts-for-big-business-wont-stimulate-the-economy_a_23256289/

Melissa Joan Hart’s fans freaked out on Saturday after she posted pictures on Instagram with the reunited cast of “Sabrina The Teenage Witch.”

Nate Richert, Caroline Rhea, Beth Broderick, Soleil Moon Frye, David Lascher, Elisa Donovan and Nick Bakay joined Hart on a panel about the show at the Los Angeles Comic-Con. Even the Quizmaster showed up:

The CW network is planning to launch “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” as a companion show to the hit teen drama “Riverdale.” But the new “Sabrina” will have much darker undertones than the popular ’90s sitcom had.

A few weeks ago, Hart said the network was going ahead without her input or that of her production company, Hartbreak Films.

“They’re doing ‘Sabrina’ without us,” Hart told HuffPost during a Build Series interview. “They’re doing like a teen soapy version, like a drama version. Ours was obviously a comedy. It was like a light comedy about magic. There is going to be more witchcraft [in the new one] ... [More like] ‘Charmed’ or ‘Buffy,’ maybe.”

It seems impossible to have Sabrina without ...well, Sabrina herself. Hart played the title character from 1997 to 2003 alongside Bakay, who voiced her beloved cat, Salem.

Much like “Buffy The Vampire Slayer,” the show was created as a spin-off to an unpopular film. Although the character originally debuted in the Archie comics during the 1960s and became a stand-alone comic, Sabrina was the focus of a little-known 1996 movie starring Hart and Ryan Reynolds.

It seems we Canadians have a serious appetite for the heebie-jeebies. You know, things that make your skin crawl and keep you up at night? In fact, when Canadians were asked in a Booking.com survey if they would stay overnight in a haunted building, half said they would and almost one in five (16 per cent) said they hoped to see a ghost. As Halloween approaches, we wanted to satisfy your curiosity for the supernatural and explore the ""dark side"" of Toronto. It might be Canada's biggest metropolis, but the 6ix has its share of hair-raising stories!

The Guild Inn

Scarborough's Guild Inn is considered one of the most haunted buildings in Ontario. Those who have stayed overnight at the old, boarded-up inn have reported hearing loud noises and vibrations along the walls and floor. Fluctuating room temperatures, rattling door handles and images of a young soldier with one blue eye and one brown have also been reported. Talk about SCARY!

Hockey Hall of Fame

Hockey's greatest legends share the same space as Dorothy the ghost at the Hockey Hall of Fame. She has been described as a lonely bank teller when the building was Bank of Montreal. Dorothy apparently took her own life after she was romantically shunned by the bank manager of the day. Visitors today claim they have heard a woman sobbing while touring the exhibits.

Christie Mansion

A secret mistress lies at the heart of the paranormal activity at what is now Regis College. Robert Christie, the son of William Mellis Christie, inherited Christie Mansion. He allegedly had a secret chamber built for his mistress, who lived in secret for years until he broke up the relationship and she hung herself. It's said if you enter Room 29 alone at night, the door will swing shut on its own.

Old City Hall

Ever noticed this grand building while walking over to the Eaton Centre? This story will make you look twice! Now a courthouse, at certain times you can hear the moans coming from empty holding cells in the basement. Phantom footsteps can be heard and the working judges have gotten quite the fright when their robes are invisibly pulled by inexplicable forces. Courtroom 33 boasts scary encounters of the spirits of what could be the last men sentenced to hang in Canada. The room is in demand every Halloween by ""ghosthunters,"" many of whom haven't been able to stay the full night, because of the weird noises and cool fogs that left them ""glued to the floor.""

Old Don Jail

If the Old Don Jail could speak, what a tale it would tell. It is home to the ghosts of the prisoners who were executed or murdered, or who took their own lives. Part of the Don remains as the administrative offices for the Bridgepoint hospital. It was the site of numerous hangings and abuse of inmates. The ghost of an angry female inmate who hung herself in her cell once haunted the jail.

Lower Bay Station

Closed for 51 years, this abandoned TTC station allegedly has a ghost dubbed the ""Lady in Red"" who glides along in a red dress with no feet or eyes, haunting the dark tunnels of Lower Bay. Used frequently for TV and movie production, workers have reported seeing a distraught lady in a red dress gliding towards them. Other reports include hearing a woman's voice singing at night.

Keg Mansion

Once owned by the powerful Massey family, the Keg Mansion rates high on the radar of Halloween thrill-seekers and ghost enthusiasts! A maid working for the Masseys was found dead above the main staircase and it's said some nights you can see her hanging from a rope above the front entrance. Other sightings include weird happenings in the women's washroom, a young boy playing on the staircase and children frolicking upstairs and in the kitchen.

Gladstone Hotel

Imagine waking up to the sounds of the piano, playing only to realize there's no one playing it. Creepy, right? Toronto's oldest continually-operating hotel, the Gladstone is rumoured to be haunted by a piano-playing ghost. The hotel opened in 1889 across from the Parkdale railroad station, which serviced the three main railway systems at the time. Besides the mysterious sounds, the hotel's décor and features like the hand-operated elevator can give anyone the chills.

Inside a pressure cooker it's not the water that's the hottest. It's the steam.

The steam can build to temperatures of up to 250 degrees, cooking the meat faster, and creating that weird whistling sound that lets you know when whatever is inside is done. Cooked.

Indeed, while Parliament is on a scheduled break the Federal Government bubbles away after another week of truly unique own goals, court-mandated and otherwise.

Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is running for a by-election after the High Court ruled him ineligible to sit in Parliament, the career of employment minister Michaelia Cash is dangling by a short thread following a bungled police raid on a union and Australia's controversial offshore immigration program is once again a powder keg.

The Government's numbers have fallen off a thin line and onto to an even thinner one, dropping from 76 to 75 MPs in the lower house. The promise of a returned majority lies in Joyce's likely win at a December 2 by-election in his New England seat.

With numbers so fine, the Government is now just one more disaster away from, well, disaster.

Joyce -- who now unshackled from Parliament declared ""I am Barnaby"" as he hit the campaign trail -- may have already inflamed simmering internal tensions.

He reportedly said the National Party were responsible for last year's election victory, arguing they held all their seats and won an extra one while the Liberals went backwards.

This, as well as some back and forth from inside the Liberal Party, left foreign minister and acting prime minister Julie Bishop defending her subbing in the top job while Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull attends an ANZAC anniversary in Israel.

""It's a question of precedence and in terms of seniority,"" she said, explaining why a Nationals MP wasn't occupying the role.

""I'm the most senior member of the cabinet after the Prime Minister and Barnaby Joyce,"" she said, also noting she was not surprised by a new Newspoll showing Labor remaining ahead 54 to 46 percent in a two party-preferred poll.

And speaking of Labor, they are threatening to add their own spice to the mix by foreshadowing some hard-ball tactics at upcoming parliamentary sittings.

One of these tactics includes a banking Royal Commission, popular with the public and the opposition, but not with the Government.

Well, not all of the Government.

Sometimes-maverick National MP George Christensen is reportedly open to working with crossbenchers to draft a bill for a banking inquiry.

""If George Christensen crossed the floor on banks, then the majority of the house is in favour,"" Independent MP Bob Katter told The Australian.

Is it any wonder opposition leader Bill Shorten's most prominent play at the moment seems to just be him dabbing while reminding us of the chaos?

All of these are just Government's public-facing problems of the moment. Tony Abbott is so-far staying quiet, but then it's only Monday.

But there are also other looming problems outside of Parliament.

A mounting deadline to close down the Australian run detention centre on Manus Island has increased tensions in the Papua New Guinea province, where the country's feared paramilitary-style ""mobile squad"" is preparing to help remove the roughly 600 asylum seekers from detention to other quarters.

The mobile squad -- who were once accused of beating a man to death in the middle of a Manus market -- will reportedly be joined by 42 former police officers, soldiers and corrections officers, reportedly hired by contractor Paladin out of Fiji to work on Manus.

The cracking point on Manus will likely come after Tuesday, when power and water are due be cut off from the detention centre.

Back home, the government's own internal cracks could yet worsen as it grinds towards Joyce's by-election.

Die AfD wollte Journalisten nur zum Parteitag zulassen, wenn sie der Speicherung höchst privater Daten zustimmen

Jetzt hat die AfD ihre Forderung zurückgezogen

Die Ausrede ist beschämend

Die AfD will offenbar privat Daten von Journalisten sammeln, beugt sich jetzt aber öffentlichem Druck.

Die neue rechtspopulistische Partei im Bundestag ist für ihren bisweilen feindseligen Umgang mit Journalisten bekannt, die Kritik an ihr üben. Was sie sich jetzt geleistet hat, stellt das Bisherige allerdings in den Schatten:

Wenn sich ein Reporter für den Bundesparteitag im Dezember in Hannover anmelden wollte, verlangte die AfD die Erlaubnis, selbst sensible Personendaten erheben, speichern und nutzen zu dürfen. Das berichtete unter anderem die ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"".

Erlaubnis betraf Daten zu politischer Meinung und Sexualleben

Konkret bezog sich die AfD auf Paragraf 3 Absatz 9 des Bundesdatenschutzgesetzes. Also auf ""Angaben über die rassische und ethnische Herkunft, politische Meinungen, religiöse oder philosophische Überzeugungen, Gewerkschaftszugehörigkeit, Gesundheit oder Sexualleben"".

Ohne die Zustimmung konnten Journalisten die Anmeldung über das Online-Formular nicht abschicken.

Experte hält Aufforderung für Verfassungswidrig

Auch wenn in dem Formular die heiklen Daten nicht abgefragt wurden, so halten Experten diese Klausel doch für nicht zulässig.

Der Spreyrer Staatsrechtler Joachim Wieland sagte dem ""Handelsblatt"" am Samstag, die Forderung der AfD sei verfassungswidrig. Sie verstoße unter anderem gegen die Pressefreiheit, gegen das Recht auf informationelle Selbstbestimmung und gegen das Diskriminierungsverbot.

Nach Informationen der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"" prüfte die Berliner Datenschutzbeauftragte den Vorfall.

Alles nur eine ""Testversion""

Am Samstagabend hatte die AfD die Klausel aus dem Anmeldeformular entfernt.

Pressesprecher Christian Lüth versuchte nach langem Schweigen, die erste Version der Anmeldung als ""Testversion"" herunterzuspielen. Offenbar hat es zwei Tage gedauert, bis sich die Partei zu dieser Ausrede durchrang.

Et ce n'est pas quelques-uns qui lui font subir de l'intimidation, c'est la majorité.

Ne jamais avoir eu de fêtes d'amis, ne jamais avoir eu de complices avec qui tout partager, ne pas avoir envie de sortir par peur des gens et de ce qu'ils peuvent dire: voici ce que mon frère Asperger subit, simplement parce que ""c'est normal ne pas aimer quelqu'un"". Et quand je parle d'intimidation, c'est tous les petits commentaires passés subtilement, ou à voix haute: quand vous lui dites qu'il n'a pas rapport; qu'il est cave; qu'il n'est pas drôle; qu'il ne sait rien faire; qu'il est bizarre; qu'il ne sait pas vivre, quand vous êtes gênés d'aller au restaurant avec lui, quand vous vous excusez pour son comportement, tout cela le blesse même s'il ne le montre pas, même s'il ne vit pas les émotions comme nous.

Un animal peut être étrange, un objet peut être étrange, un extraterrestre peut être étrange, mais pour un humain, c'est un emploi complètement déplacé et réducteur.

Vous me direz que je ne suis pas mieux, parce que je dis qu'il est différent! Eh bien oui, je dis qu'il est différent parce que la société nous impose des étiquettes – normal ou différent — et lui ne tombe pas dans la supposée catégorie sociale ""normale"". J'en veux à cette société-reine-de-l'étiquette d'imposer des standards comportementaux, mais, pour être sincère, j'en veux davantage à tous ceux qui les suivent.

On ne fera jamais sentir à un dépressif qu'il est gênant de sortir en public avec lui, alors pourquoi le faire à un Asperger?

À mon sens, cette lâcheté est signe d'un manque de maturité, d'un manque de connaissance, mais surtout, d'un manque de compréhension et d'ouverture d'esprit que de le rabaisser. Le nombre de fois qu'il a essayé de s'inclure ""dans notre monde"", ""dans le monde des gens normaux"", ne pouvons-nous pas juste l'accepter comme il est ? On ne dira jamais à une personne en chaise roulante qu'il prend trop de place, alors pourquoi un Asperger est dérangeant et prend trop de place? On ne fera jamais sentir à un dépressif qu'il est gênant de sortir en public avec lui, alors pourquoi le faire à un Asperger? On ne dira jamais à une personne ""normale"" qu'elle est étrange, alors pourquoi le dire à un Asperger?

À tous ceux qui qualifient mon frère d'étrange, il est plus franc, il a moins de malice et il est plus pur que n'importe quelle autre personne ""normale"".

The switch in numbers came as some Labour MPs were accused of privately suggesting there was a “witch-hunt” against men in Parliament, and had joked that they should “fess up” to their misconduct.

At the 2017 election, a record 208 women MPs were elected, but still make up barely a third of the total. Normally men dominate proceedings in the Commons, as just 21% of Tories and 45% of Labour MPs are female. But on Monday, all that changed as women packed the chamber and men turned up in noticeably fewer numbers. Early in proceedings, HuffPost UK counted 65 women and just 56 men in the Commons, giving female Parliamentarians a rare majority. More than a third of Tory MPs present for the Urgent Question – tabled by Labour’s Harriet Harman - were women, way above their usual percentage. Commons Leader Leadsom was flanked by Theresa May and a trio of women - Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the PM’s Parliamentary Private Secretary Seema Kennedy, and Mims Davies – sat behind them.

But gaps in the green benches were apparent and by the end of the 75-minute session, there were few Tory MPs left present. Later in the Urgent Question, the gender balance was even more stark. On the Labour benches, women eventually outnumbered male colleagues by two to one (35 women to just 16 men on the green benches). Labour MP Jess Phillips revealed that just before the debate, a pair of her colleagues had not been as gripped of its importance as she was. “As I walked in here, as I rushed in here today to come to this statement, I overheard two male colleagues walking through the halls wittering about a witch hunt that was going on in Parliament,” she said.",Women MPs Outnumber Men During Commons Sex Harassment Debate,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/women-mps-outnumber-men-during-sex-harassment-debate_uk_59f77941e4b09b5c2568457b

CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne haben sich bei Bildung und Digitalisierung auf höhere Investitionen einigen können

Nach dem Streit in der vergangenen Woche haben die ""Jamaikaner"" zur konstruktiven Arbeit zurückgefunden - und können am Montagabend Ergebnisse vorlegen.

Die Einigung: CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne wollen in einer möglichen Jamaika-Koalition die Ausgaben für Bildung und Forschung deutlich steigern und die digitale Infrastruktur ausbauen.

Zum bisherigen Kooperationsverbot zwischen Bund und Ländern in der Bildung heißt es in einem am Montag in Berlin veröffentlichten Papier der Jamaika-Unterhändler lediglich: ""Über die Art und Weise der Zusammenarbeit zwischen Bund, Ländern und Kommunen muss noch gesprochen werden, insbesondere über die Frage des Kooperationsverbotes.""

So viel Geld wollen die Parteien ausgeben

Bis zum Jahr 2025 sollten für Bildung und Forschung mehr als zehn Prozent des Bruttoinlandsproduktes (BIP) aufgewendet werden, heißt es in dem Papier.

Zudem wollen die Parteien die Ausbildungsförderung Bafög modernisieren und mehr Studenten einen Anspruch eröffnen. Die Aufwendungen für Forschung und Entwicklung, die Nahtstelle zwischen Hochschulen und Wirtschaft, sollen auf 3,5 Prozent des BIP erhöht werden.

Für die Digitalisierung sei der Breitbandausbau wesentlich. Welche Technologie dazu genutzt werde - etwa Glasfaser - sei noch zu erörtern, machte CDU-Generalsekretär Peter Tauber deutlich.

Zudem sollen möglichst schnell Funklöcher auf dem Land geschlossen werden. Wo dieses Themenfeld angesiedelt werden soll - als selbstständiges Ministerium, bei Bildung und Forschung oder bei der Wirtschaft - sei offen, sagte Tauber.

""Jamaika könnte das Bündnis der digitalen Chancen sein""

Bei der Digitalisierung gehe es auch um den Ausbau der Datensicherheit, sagte FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer. Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner sagte: ""Jamaika könnte ... könnte das Bündnis der digitalen Chancen sein.""

Wie Beer hob er hervor, dass sich die Unterhändler klar zu einem modernen Datenrecht bekannt hätten - unter Wahrung der Bürgerrechte. Der auslaufende Hochschulpakt zwischen Bund und Ländern zur Bewältigung der hohen Studierendenzahlen solle verlängert werden.

Alle vier hoben hervor, dass sich die Arbeitsatmosphäre wesentlich verbessert habe. Kellner sagte, der Pulverdampf der vergangenen Woche sei wohl mit dem Wind vom Wochenende verflogen. Er sprach von einer ""sehr guten Arbeitsatmosphäre"".

Auch bei weiteren Themenblöcken bestehen Einigungen

Auch bei der Pflege haben sich die Parteien geeinigt: der Pflegebereich soll gestärkt werden. Dazu seien mehr Personal und bessere Ausstattung notwendig, sagte Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner am Montag in Berlin. Darüber hinaus seien für die Grünen die Beitragsparität bei den Beiträgen für die gesetzliche Krankenversicherung wichtig.

Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Bund und Ländern im Kampf gegen Terrorismus wollen Union, FDP und Grüne verbessern. Dabei solle die Koordinierungsfunktion von Bundeskriminalamt und Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV) stärker als bisher wahrgenommen werden, heißt es in einem Leitlinien-Papier zum Bereich Innen, Sicherheit und Rechtsstaat.

Der Einsatz von Videoüberwachung solle an Kriminalitätsschwerpunkten, an besonders gefährlichen Orten, Einrichtungen und bei Veranstaltungen gegebenenfalls auch befristet angeordnet werden können, heißt es weiter. Zudem sei die Cybersicherheit für die Zukunft Deutschlands von herausragender Bedeutung.

""Es ist in einer Nacht nicht leichter geworden""

Nach dem Geheimtreffen der Parteichefs vom Sonntagabend waren die Jamaika-Unterhändler in der Tat bemüht, die aufgeheizte Stimmung abzukühlen.

CSU-Parteichef Horst Seehofer sagte vor Beginn der Sondierungen am Montag, die Runde der Vorsitzenden habe der Atmosphäre gut getan. ""Aber es ist jetzt nicht in einer Nacht leichter geworden. Einfach von der Sache her.""

Neben Bildung und Digitales standen auch die Themenbereiche Arbeit, Rente sowie Inneres und Recht auf dem Programm. Am Nachmittag kam der mehr als 50 Mitglieder große Kreis der Unterhändler zusammen, um eine Zwischenbilanz zu ziehen.

Bereits am Donnerstag wollen sie sich erneut an die Themen Migration und Klimaschutz machen, die in der vergangenen Woche zu massivem Streit geführt hatten und vertagt worden waren.

In der Zuwanderungspolitik ist der Familiennachzug für Flüchtlinge einer der Knackpunkte. Beim Klimaschutz gab es vergangene Woche Krach darüber, wie die nationalen und internationalen Ziele zur Treibhausgas-Minderung erreicht werden sollen.

Jusqu'en 1945, les Allemands entonnaient leur hymne national en commençant par la phrase « Deutschland Deutschland über alles » (« L'Allemagne, l'Allemagne, par-dessus tout »)*. Aujourd'hui, bien des gens chantent « Uber Uber über alles », qu'ils soient pour ou contre.

De nous deux, l'un chante ses mérites, l'autre s'y oppose. Nous habitons tous les deux à Montréal où nous travaillons ensemble et, hormis Uber, nous sommes de bons amis. Leslie a vécu aux États-Unis, et brièvement en France, jusqu'à ce qu'elle déménage à Montréal en 2010. Henry est né et a été élevé à Montréal. Il a aussi vécu quelques années en Angleterre, en France et même aux États-Unis. Voilà peut-être ce qui explique notre point de vue différent à propos d'Uber.

Leslie à propos d'Uber : la concurrence par-dessus tout

J'adore la technologie, l'innovation, la commodité, la nouveauté, quand c'est judicieux. Uber est entré en scène avec des prix attrayants, mais c'était plus une question de commodité et de facilité d'utilisation. Pas d'appel téléphonique, pas de cafouillage sur le lieu de rendez-vous, et surtout, pas d'échange d'argent dans le véhicule. À l'arrivée, il suffit d'un simple « merci » et le tour est joué.

Ce qui compte, c'est qu'Uber et les autres entreprises de covoiturage bouleversent l'industrie du taxi pour offrir un meilleur service, partout à travers le monde, et ce, depuis près d'une décennie.

Est-ce qu'Uber est une « innovation de rupture »? Est-ce important? (« Why Clayton Christensen is Wrong About Uber and Disruptive Innovation », par Alex Moazed et Nicholas L. Johnson, Techcrunch.com (27 février 2016)) Ce qui compte, c'est qu'Uber et les autres entreprises de covoiturage bouleversent l'industrie du taxi pour offrir un meilleur service, partout à travers le monde, et ce, depuis près d'une décennie. Il est assez évident que depuis ce temps, les compagnies de taxi ont eu le temps de se brancher!

J'ai foi en la société de droit. Je paie des impôts dans deux pays. Je comprends cependant la longue tradition qui veut que nous cherchions à éviter les taxes par tous les moyens légaux possibles. Outre cela, nous faisons régulièrement fi des lois quand elles sont manifestement déraisonnables ou qu'elles visent à soutenir des pratiques monopolistiques. Cette forme de désobéissance civile attire l'attention sur le besoin de changement. Comme Uber en transport, Airbnb fait concurrence aux hôtels traditionnels et Turo, aux entreprises traditionnelles de location de voitures. Avant l'arrivée des téléphones cellulaires et d'Airbnb, les hôtels escroquaient les gens avec les frais liés aux appels téléphoniques personnels, puis avec ceux liés à Internet. Turo évite les taxes aéroportuaires abusives en permettant aux gens de louer des voitures à l'extérieur du site de l'aéroport ou auprès de propriétaires privés qui viennent les chercher à l'aéroport.

Les gouvernements doivent mettre en place des lois qui nous protègent, mais qui sont aussi à notre avantage.

Les gouvernements doivent mettre en place des lois qui nous protègent, mais qui sont aussi à notre avantage. Des conditions équitables et la réalisation sont importantes, mais comme nous le voyons peut-être maintenant avec Uber, il est possible d'atteindre un équilibre grâce à la coopération, la négociation et la collaboration en permettant le genre de choix auxquels nous sommes en droit de nous attendre au sein d'une démocratie.

Henry à propos d'Uber : les travailleurs, les règlements et les gouvernements par-dessus tout

Aujourd'hui, l'idée de mondialisation est largement répandue : « les investisseurs, les investisseurs par-dessus tout » – par-dessus les travailleurs, par-dessus les lois et règlements, par-dessus la souveraineté nationale. Il ne faut pas se leurrer : Uber n'est que la plus récente version des pratiques anti-travailleurs qui, depuis plusieurs années, tendent à ramener le salaire de la classe moyenne vers le salaire minimum, au grand plaisir des actionnaires et des clients. Les syndicats ont d'abord éclaté, puis la sécurité d'emploi a disparu en compagnie des avantages sociaux. Ainsi, la baisse des salaires qui s'est ensuivie a fait éclater le tissu social des sociétés. Pas étonnant que tant de gens en aient marre de la mondialisation économique qui fait peu de cas de la décence et de la démocratie.

Les gens qui exploitent les taxis traditionnels doivent acheter ce droit auprès des autorités municipales et se conformer à différents règlements destinés à protéger le public. Puis Uber est arrivé avec ses gros sabots et a ignoré les règlements alors que les administrations municipales fermaient les yeux. Il vaut mieux ne pas toucher à la mondialisation. Il est par contre permis de toucher aux travailleurs locaux. Pourquoi ne devraient-ils pas gagner le salaire minimum pour que nous, les bien payés, y compris nos dirigeants gouvernementaux, puissions tirer profit de la commodité? Puis, quand les chauffeurs de taxi se défendent, ils se font traiter de méchants et d'impolis, et se font accuser de conduire des voitures sales. (Si c'est maintenant plus fréquent, c'est peut-être parce qu'ils en ont marre de se faire avoir.)

C'est drôle, car Uber fait monter des gens dans un véhicule et les emmène partout en ville en échange d'un prix pour la course. Ça ressemble pas mal à un service de taxi... si vous voulez mon avis.

Uber affirme ne pas être un service de taxi. (Tout comme j'affirme que ceci n'est pas un blogue parce que j'appelle ça un « TWOG » [un « TWeet 2 blOG », c'est-à-dire un gazouillis sur Twitter transformé en blogue].) C'est drôle, car Uber fait monter des gens dans un véhicule et les emmène partout en ville en échange d'un prix pour la course. Ça ressemble pas mal à un service de taxi... si vous voulez mon avis. Non, affirment-ils, il s'agit d'un service de covoiturage. Ah bon, quand, pour la dernière fois, avez-vous partagé un véhicule Uber avec un étranger? D'accord, mais les chauffeurs d'Uber sont des travailleurs autonomes. Eh bien, que sont les chauffeurs de taxi qui sont propriétaires d'un permis et qui ont formé une coopérative? En plus de la contre-information (fake news), nous vivons aussi dans un monde de contre-mots (fake words).

Apple a connu le succès en rivalisant avec de meilleurs produits; Uber a du succès en trichant avec un meilleur service. C'est le pitbull suprême dans un monde où les entreprises pitbulls abondent, et il semble aussi l'être dans sa gestion et dans sa culture d'entreprise. L'expression suivante est tirée d'un article récent du New York Times à propos des efforts de Londres pour se débarrasser d'Uber : « Le sentiment qui règne en ce moment veut que les organismes de règlementation doivent tenir tête aux entreprises qui ignorent tout simplement les règlements qui ne font pas leur affaire.» Ça alors! Tenir tête aux multinationales et les forcer à respecter la primauté du droit. Quelle idée novatrice! Ce n'est pas un sentiment qui circule, c'est un véritable coup de massue.

Leslie et Henry : la synergie par-dessus tout?

Peut-être avons-nous tous les deux raison? Nos points de vue divergents ne sont peut-être après tout qu'une question de contexte. Leslie cite la corruption dans l'industrie du taxi, qui a particulièrement sévi à New York avec ses taxis jaunes. Ces taxis sont dorénavant moins nombreux qu'en 1937, quand ils ont été introduits pour la première fois au coût de 10 $ chacun. Certaines personnes ont fait fortune grâce aux taxis jaunes (le prix ayant dépassé le million de dollars avant qu'Uber ne s'installe), alors que certains chauffeurs qui louaient leur voiture éprouvaient des difficultés financières. Autrement dit, à New York du moins, cette baisse des revenus a précédé l'entrée en scène d'Uber, bien que cela ne se soit pas calmé depuis. Alors, pourquoi la majorité écrasante de chauffeurs new-yorkais qui ne conduisent pas un taxi jaune ne devraient-ils pas passer à Uber?

La ville établit des restrictions sévères quant au nombre de permis en circulation et ceux-ci sont liés à la propriété individuelle des véhicules.

Henry souligne qu'à Montréal, les taxis sont nombreux et que plusieurs d'entre eux sont conduits par des propriétaires polis qui gagnaient de meilleurs revenus, du moins avant l'arrivée d'Uber. La ville établit des restrictions sévères quant au nombre de permis en circulation et ceux-ci sont liés à la propriété individuelle des véhicules. Autrement dit, les contextes sont différents. Montréal se rapproche peut-être plus que New York des autres villes qui ont défié Uber.

Par conséquent, appliquons-nous une solution à un problème de corruption typiquement new-yorkais dans des villes où ce problème n'existe pas? Autrement dit, est-ce un cas d'exceptionnalisme américain, délaissé par Donald Trump dans sa politique étrangère, mais repris par les sociétés américaines dans le marché international? C'est du moins la façon dont de nombreux Canadiens voient le monde aujourd'hui, tout comme de nombreux Européens. Les Américains adorent la nouveauté, et la concurrence qu'elle apporte, alors que les Canadiens tendent à se méfier davantage des multinationales agressives et à se préoccuper des négligés et de la bonne foi.

Nos positions semblent pouvoir se réconcilier, synergiquement, si vous le voulez. Gardez les avantages d'Uber, tout en forçant l'entreprise à respecter les règles, du moins les règles raisonnables. Voilà peut-être ce qui se passe à Montréal en ce moment. Quand le gouvernement du Québec a récemment cherché à imposer des restrictions à Uber, l'entreprise a indiqué qu'elle entendait quitter le Québec à une certaine date. Le gouvernement n'a pas plié, et Uber n'est pas partie. La proposition à l'examen est qu'Uber achète un certain nombre de permis, exige et paie les taxes de même que des frais par course. Uber devrait aussi s'assurer que ses chauffeurs aient les assurances et les permis adéquats et que les véhicules soient régulièrement inspectés. Autrement dit, Uber devrait se comporter comme la compagnie de taxi qu'elle est. L'entreprise ne semble pas ravie par la proposition, mais il pourrait s'agir d'une manière de conserver les innovations tout en mettant fin à l'indécence. Est-ce que ça veut dire jeter le bébé Uber avec l'eau du bain du taxi? Qui sait?

Aux États-Unis, les gouvernements cherchent à établir un équilibre entre le besoin grandissant pour un transport urbain souple et la protection des intérêts des chauffeurs de taxi.

Les compagnies de taxi établies doivent évidemment se réveiller – et vite. Elles peuvent reproduire plusieurs des innovations d'Uber. (Le prépaiement par carte de crédit est loin d'être sous brevet.) Pendant ce temps, d'autres variantes surgissent un peu partout dans le monde. À Londres, avec Gett, certains des légendaires taxis noirs offrent un service via une application mobile. L'usager peut choisir de payer un tarif fixe à l'avance ou d'utiliser le compteur. Aux États-Unis, les gouvernements cherchent à établir un équilibre entre le besoin grandissant pour un transport urbain souple et la protection des intérêts des chauffeurs de taxi.

Même Leslie a adopté un système hybride : elle a rencontré un chauffeur titulaire d'un permis qui préfère conduire ses propres clients. Ainsi, pour certains de ses besoins, elle communique directement avec lui, selon les tarifs d'un taxi. Oui, elle paie plus cher qu'avec Uber, mais en retour, elle est assurée que le véhicule sera toujours propre et bien entretenu et surtout, qu'elle a un chauffeur sûr à qui elle peut faire confiance. En fait, il est presque devenu un ami. Leslie a ainsi fait sa part pour la décence.

*Il semble que cette phrase ait d'abord fait référence à une Allemagne réunifiée plutôt qu'à ses différentes parties, mais les Nazis avaient possiblement autre chose en tête. Cette phrase n'est plus chantée officiellement.

If this book only serves to prove that the English language is still very much active and alive, then it’s done its job.
Did you find any base-level theories for why words change in meaning?
Being a language born of various roots, is English more prone to evolving in this way than a language with a more homogenous history?
But you’re right ― the English language has such a checkered, sprawling history that I think it is likely more liable to change than most.","If you see it in the dictionary, it’s so: This deferential trust seems to be the general attitude toward dictionaries, whether it’s the Oxford or the Merriam-Webster. You can’t get Scrabble points for your clever conjugation unless it’s in the official dictionary, and teachers tend to reach for red pens when neologisms crop up in term papers.

But while the dictionary offers neat columns of words, followed by clear and definitive meanings, it is a haphazard document at its heart. Language itself is a constantly shifting, changing thing, so any guidebook to it also reflects those shifts and changes ― and over time, the book itself must be edited and reedited to reflect an evolving linguistic reality.

That’s the premise of The Accidental Dictionary, writer and etymologist Paul Anthony Jones’ latest book. (Jones, who runs the @HaggardHawks Twitter account and blog, has written several engaging books about etymological curiosities over the past few years.) “Under scrutiny,” writes Jones in the introduction, “the dictionary reveals an unpredictable network of etymological crossed paths, U-turns, and forks in the road.” The Accidental Dictionary takes the form of a dictionary ― a 100-word dictionary ― and adds that scrutiny, revealing the many lives each word has lived.

“Clumsy” once meant “numb with cold.” “Hallucinate” once meant “deceive,” and “prestigious” once meant “deceitful.” “Queen” once meant “wife.” (Viewed from a relatively enlightened, feminist era, that one is rather disappointing.) Somehow, these words were shunted sidewise, rejiggered or tweaked; though they’re still familiar to us today, their meanings have entirely changed.

Though we might conceive of rapidly shifting slang and improper usage as ailments of our modern society ― and, you know, kids these days ― Jones’ work is a potent reminder that the words we use have never been static. English speakers have been molding and playing with the language for centuries, and that’s not changing any time soon. In a few hundred years, who knows what our accidental dictionaries might look like?

In an interview with HuffPost, Jones spoke about our changing language in the age of the internet, the patchwork foundation of modern English, and some of his favorite odd etymologies:

Pegasus Books

Rather than having an ongoing narrative or argument, this book really is in dictionary format. How do you think it should be read?

I’m one of those strange people who reads dictionaries for fun, but even I don’t read them cover to cover! And so I had presumed that readers would dip into The Accidental Dictionary like any other reference book, reading a few entries here or there. But since the U.K. edition came out last year I’ve had a lot of emails and tweets from people saying that they have actually sat down and read it from start to finish ― each word’s little potted history works like a single short story I guess, so the book has ended up acting like an etymological anthology.

Do you see the book as having an overarching takeaway or argument? What can we learn about our language from these stories?

If there’s one thing to take away from this book it’s that the language is always changing. It’s easy to think that once a word finds its way into the dictionary it’s set in stone, but that’s of course not the case. Not only are new words being coined and old words being lost every day, but existing words are being molded and mutated, and knocked into different shapes to better fit what we need them to mean. If this book only serves to prove that the English language is still very much active and alive, then it’s done its job.

Which word’s story do you find the most delightful or surprising?

I have to admit I have a few personal favorites: I love the fact that a cupboard was originally a table, and that pink was originally yellow (and in that sense probably derives from pinkeln, an old German dialect word meaning “to urinate”). But the stories I keep coming back to are those of words like man, girl and bimbo. These have not only changed their meaning over time, but in doing so have essentially changed their sex.

Man originally meant “human” (as it does in words like mankind and manslaughter), so was once used of both men and women. Same goes for girl, which originally meant just “child,“ and so could be applied to both girls and boys. And a bimbo was originally a burly, thickset man ― like a gangster’s heavy, or some enormous brutish bully. In the sense of someone who is appreciated more for their physique than anything else, bimbo eventually came to be applied to an attractive woman, and thanks to some (cringingly sexist but no less popular) music hall songs in the mid-1900s, this eventually became the word’s only surviving meaning. So much so, in fact, that a word for a male equivalent, the “himbo,” had to be “re-invented” in the 1980s. Although we might expect words to change over time, for them to change their gender in the process is quite startling I think.

How did you compile the list? Was it a long-term project of adding as they came up, or did you set out to find these words?

A lot of the words on the final list had come up before in blogposts and tweets on Haggard Hawks, so the book really offered the opportunity to dive into their histories in more detail. But once I’d started researching this all more broadly, I ended up with a shortlist of about 200 possible entries culled from etymological dictionaries and glossaries. I eventually whittled that down by half by focusing just on the words whose stories I thought represented the greatest or most surprising changes.

Were there any words you wanted to include that didn’t quite make the cut, and why did they get axed?

Oh, plenty! Jackpot was one I was sorry to cut out. Originally it referred to a pool or “pot” of cash in a card game that accumulates until a player can open the betting with a pair of jacks or better. I’ve always had a bit of a soft spot for etymologies that are staring you in the face like that. A few, like the fact that a secretary is literally a “keeper of secrets,” made the final cut ― but this one seemed just a little too straightforward alongside the other 100 in the book. I was also sorry to leave out the fact that fizzling originally meant breaking wind, but with G-strings and feces both making the final cut, that was just one questionable entry too many!

Did you find any base-level theories for why words change in meaning? Is it just happenstance, or widespread ignorance of a word’s original meaning, or perhaps an ideophonic affinity between the word’s sound and the meaning it acquired?

I don’t think there’s one solid rule or explanation for why words change, but because the book covers entries from Old English right through to the modern day, what did become clear is that the impetus for these changes has itself changed over time. So way back in the Old English period, many changes were driven by the fact that the English vocabulary was growing so enormously, particularly with influence from French words borrowed after the Norman Conquest. The fact that English adopted the word boy from French, for instance, is probably the reason why girl came to change as boy began to encroach on its meaning.

In the Middle Ages and beyond, you can see literature start to play a bigger part: writers, authors and poets bending the meanings of words to suit what they want them to mean. And to an extent, that has continued in the modern era through journalism as well as fiction: it was newspapers, for instance, that popularized the figurative use of the word blockbuster to describe something extraordinarily impactful or successful in the 1940s. Before then, it was the name of a huge aerial bomb developed by the RAF that was capable of literally destroying a block of buildings.

Being a language born of various roots, is English more prone to evolving in this way than a language with a more homogenous history? Or do we see it just as much in other languages?

I think all languages certainly see elements of evolution over time: people are naturally curious and inventive, and as no language exists outside of its speakers and users, if they begin to use a word in a new context or adopt or invent words to replace others then the language as a whole will change to accommodate them.

But you’re right ― the English language has such a checkered, sprawling history that I think it is likely more liable to change than most. If you think about how lengthy its history is, how much of the world it has touched and been imposed upon, and just how numerous and how diverse its speakers are today, you start to see just how unlikely it is that English would remain unaltered, at any point in its history.

This seems like something of a rebuttal to prescriptivism, showing that even words we feel we know very well have evolved over time. Do you think this book makes a case for a descriptivist approach?

I certainly wouldn’t want say this book actively argues for descriptivism or against prescriptivism ― it’s just recording the facts. But you’re right that seemingly the facts here just so happen to support a descriptivist approach to language more than the prescriptivist one. If every time a word was used in a new or innovative way or context a prescriptivist approach quashed the change and slapped the word back into place, the language would never have evolved in the way it has and we would doubtless be left with a less rich vocabulary as a result.

Is there any value, in your eyes, in a prescriptivist approach? Is there anything to gain by trying fix words’ definitions in place rather than rolling with the evolutions that arise?

I think there can be value in formalizing a language certainly, and if that comes even in part from a prescriptivist approach then so be it. After all, it’s by establishing rules and norms that languages become mutually intelligible among all their speakers, and are both translatable and learnable to speakers of other languages.

What does not have value in my eyes is using those rules to make judgement calls on other people’s use of the language, or to point out “mistakes” other people may have made, which is what the prescriptivist cause is often commandeered to do. One of the very first things I was ever taught when I first started studying language more than a decade ago was that there is no such thing as right and wrong; there is standard and non-standard, and they are in no way the same. You can break as many rules as you want ― all that matters is that you’ve communicated what you need to communicate effectively and have been understood. Does it really matter that you’ve split an infinitive or used “disinterested” instead of “uninterested” in doing so? Not one bit.

A lot of these word-change stories go back centuries. How is the Internet impacting how, and how quickly, words evolve?

The internet and social media age is probably coining as many new words as it is altering existing ones, but either way I think it’s undoubtedly accelerating the process. Say a word gets used in a certain way on a reality TV program. People watching it then tweet about it. Fans start using it. Then journalists and academics (and people like me) start writing about it. And suddenly the word has changed or gained an entirely new meaning, all within a matter of months, perhaps even weeks.

This recently happened over here in the U.K. with a (terrible but still massively popular) reality show called “Love Island.” The contestants on there started using the word “muggy” to mean “untrustworthy” or “deceptive.” That meaning has certainly found its way into millennial slang, and if it continues to be used will doubtless begin to find its way into some dictionaries. The question is whether it will ever oust the existing meaning of muggy from the language.",An 'Accidental Dictionary' Explores How Errors Created The English Language,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-accidental-dictionary-explores-how-errors-created-the-english-language_us_59ef5acee4b0d14acdccb30b

""Puedo confirmar que me ha contratado como representante legal"", ha dicho el letrado, que no ha querido confirmar si está trabajando en una petición de asilo.

Tendrían previsto pedir asilo político.

Este viaje coincide con el anuncio de la Fiscalía General del Estado de presentación de querellas contra Puigdemont, su cesado Govern y los miembros de la Mesa del Parlament por rebelión, sedición y malversación. El delito de rebelión, por ejemplo, puede conllevar hasta 30 años de prisión.

¿ASILO POLÍTICO?

Esta noticia se conocía después de que el secretario de Estado belga de Inmigración y nacionalista flamenco, Theo Francken, dijera este domingo que su país podría conceder asilo político al cesado presidente de la Generalitat si así lo pidiera ante la posibilidad de que no recibiera ""un juicio justo"" en el caso de ser detenido.

""No es algo irreal, bien mirado"", declaró Francken en una entrevista a la cadena belga VTM. ""Se está hablando ya de una pena de cárcel (para Puigdemont). Quedaría por ver hasta qué punto sería justo ese juicio"", añadió, siempre sobre la hipótesis de que Puigdemont decidiera huir a Bélgica.

El primer ministro belga, Charles Michel, pidió posteriormente a su secretario de Estado que no echara ""aceite al fuego"". En un comunicado, Michel señalaba que el asilo para Puigdemont no está ""en el orden del día"" del Gobierno de Bélgica.

El primer ministro de Bélgica gobierna en coalición con el partido de Francken, la Alianza Neo-Flamenca, cuyo programa político apuesta por la separación pacífica de Flandes. Ello ha llevado a Michel a adoptar una postura por la que no ha terminado de dar nunca por completo la razón al Gobierno español, a diferencia de los socios europeos.

EL MINISTERIO BELGA DE INTERIOR Y LOS NACIONALISTAS FLAMENCOS SE DESMARCAN

Este lunes, tanto el ministro del Interior belga, Jan Jambon, del partido nacionalista flamenco N-VA, como esa formación política, se han desmarcado del viaje de Puigdemont a Bruselas.

Jambon ""no está al corriente"" de la visita, ha indicado un portavoz del ministro, quien además ""no ha mantenido ningún contacto en los últimos días"" con el expresidente catalán.

Igualmente, ha desmentido que la N-VA haya cursado una invitación a Bruselas a Puigdemont.

Sie alle haben aus unterschiedlichen Gründen die Regierung verlassen

Doch eines haben ihre Geschichten gemeinsam: Sie zeigen, wie sehr Trump und seine Helfer das politische System verwüsten

Ich habe schon viele Trump-Hasser getroffen. Typen, die sich auf jede Verschwörungstheorie stürzen und US-Präsident Donald Trump nicht die geringste Chance geben.

Die vier Menschen, mit denen ich vor Kurzem einen Vormittag in Solly’s Tavern in Washington D. C. verbracht habe (ganz alkoholfrei, keine Sorge), hassen Trump nicht.

Aber sie haben sich von ihm abgewandt.

Sie alle haben irgendwann in den vergangenen neun Monaten beschlossen, ihre Stellen bei der Regierung zu kündigen, da sie der Meinung waren, ihrem Land außerhalb der Regierung besser dienen zu können.

Mit der Entscheidung waren sie nicht glücklich.

Sie waren Angestellte im öffentlichen Dienst und wollten auch weiterhin in diesem Sektor tätig sein. Bis auf eine Ausnahme hatten sie alle bereits für Präsidenten beider Parteien gearbeitet.

Sie waren mit ihren Vorgesetzten nicht immer einer Meinung, sie hatten Angst vor neuen Vorschriften und begegneten neuen politischen Gesichtern mit Vorsicht.

Und trotzdem sind sie immer geblieben, denn so ist das nun einmal, wenn man für die Regierung arbeitet.

Aber jetzt war es anders.

Wie bei einem Treffen alter Freunde

Als sich die vier vor zwei Wochen das erste Mal trafen, um die Situation zu diskutieren, stellten sie sofort fest, dass sie in vielen Punkten gleicher Meinung waren. Die Stimmung glich fast einem Wiedersehen alter Freunde nach vielen Jahren – mit dem kleinen Unterschied, dass sie sich erst fünf Minuten zuvor kennengelernt hatten.

Sie kamen aus verschiedenen Bereichen des Bürokratieapparates, sie waren unterschiedlich alt und auch ihre Lebensläufe hätten unterschiedlicher nicht sein können. Aber sie alle hatten sich seit Trumps Wahlsieg ähnliche Gedanken gemacht.

Würden sich die Arbeitskollegen hintergangen fühlen, wenn sie jetzt einfach so kündigten? Würden ihre freigewordenen Stellen mit jemandem besetzt werden, der eine gänzlich andere Meinung vertrat, eine Meinung, die sich von ihrer eigenen grundlegend unterschied?

Die meiste Zeit hatten sie im Hintergrund gearbeitet. Wie würde es sein, jetzt so in die Öffentlichkeit zu treten?

""Ich spürte eine große Angst""

Als das Interview, das zum besseren Verständnis redigiert und überarbeitet wurde, erst einmal lief, waren alle vier locker, zu Späßen aufgelegt und offen. Sie arbeiten vielleicht nicht mehr für die Regierung, aber sie sehen sich immer noch im Dienst der Öffentlichkeit.

Sharon McGowan bekleidete früher eine leitende Position im Bereich Bürgerrechte im Justizministerium. Sie arbeitete an der Umsetzung fortschrittlicher Politik, wie der Ehe für alle. Jetzt ist sie strategische Direktorin bei Lambda Legal.

HuffPost: Sharon, du bist als erste geflohen. Fangen wir bei der Wahlnacht an: Was waren deine Gedanken? Wie hat es sich angefühlt?

Sharon McGowan: Ich verspürte eine große Angst, die ich auch körperlich fühlen konnte. Am Tag nach der Wahl beschlossen meine Frau und ich, zuhause zu bleiben, um uns als Familie neu aufzustellen. Als ein gleichgeschlechtliches Paar in diesem Land wussten wir sehr genau, was kommen würde.

Und in den ersten paar Tagen versuchte ich mit aller Macht, mich zu beruhigen: Vielleicht hatte Trump vieles gar nicht so gemeint. Vielleicht war das alles nur dem Wahlkampf geschuldet. Und das hat irgendwie auch funktioniert! Zumindest so lange, bis Jeff Sessions als Justizminister vorgeschlagen wurde. Da wusste ich, dass meine Tage bei der Regierung gezählt waren.

Du hattest keinen Zweifel daran, dass du gehen würdest?

McGowan: Doch, ich hatte auch Momente des Zweifels. Am Tag, als ich meine Kündigung eingereicht hatte, sagte die amtierende Justizministerin Sally Yates, dass sie den Einreisebann für Muslime nicht unterstützen würde.

Da kamen mir Zweifel, vielleicht hatte ich doch das Falsche getan. Vielleicht sollte ich doch bleiben. Doch wenig später wurde Sally Yates entlassen. Das sah ich als Zeichen des Universums, dass ich doch nicht vorschnell gehandelt hatte.

Quelle: Stephen Voss

Walt, du bist bis zum Juli geblieben. Erzähle mir mal von dem Moment, als du erkannt hast, dass sich deine Welt fundamental verändert hatte.

Walter Shaub: Meine Geschichte ist etwas anders, denn ich wachte am Tag nach der Wahl auf und war bezüglich meiner Arbeit im Übergangsteam recht optimistisch. Seit fünf Monaten arbeiteten wir schon zusammen und es waren alles kluge und gewissenhafte Menschen.

Ich schickte also eine fröhliche Glückwunsch-E-Mail an die eine Seite und drückte der anderen Seite per E-Mail mein Bedauern aus. Von beiden erhielt ich eine Antwort, in der man mir für die Zusammenarbeit dankte.

Die Leute aus dem Trump-Team schrieben, dass sie sich darauf freuten, die gute Zusammenarbeit fortzusetzen und dass sie sich am Nachmittag melden würden, um einen Termin für das nächste Treffen festzulegen. Die Übergangszeit dauert ungefähr 73 Tage. So viel Zeit bleibt, um eine komplette Regierung aufzustellen.

Man muss genau wissen, was man tut, und man muss jede Sekunde nutzen. Es ist eine Mammutaufgabe. Aber bis zum Nachmittag waren all die Personen, mit denen wir bisher zusammengearbeitet hatten, verschwunden, und es herrschte Schweigen.

Später lasen wir in den Nachrichten, dass Don McGahn als Berater für die Übergangszeit im Gespräch war. (Don McGahn ist eine feste Größe in Washington D.C. und jetzt ein Berater im Weißen Haus, Anm. d. Red.) Aber es gelang uns eine ganze Zeit lang nicht, ein Treffen mit ihm zu auszumachen. Als es dann endlich zu dem Treffen kam, wurde schnell klar, wie ahnungslos er war.

Er fragte mich, ob ich derjenige sei, der für die Sicherheitsfreigabe verantwortlich sei oder ob ich die Hintergrundüberprüfung der möglichen neuen Regierungsmitglieder, die vom FBI durchgeführt wird, überwachen würde. Und ich erklärte McGahn, dass das nicht meine, sondern seine Aufgabe sei. Darauf folgte nur ein erstauntes ""Tatsächlich?“.

Aber der Höhe- oder vielmehr Tiefpunkt war dann, als Don McGahn eines Tages unauffindbar war. Aus der Zeitung erfuhren wir schließlich, dass er mit seiner Eightys-Coverband an diesem Tag einen Auftritt in Philadelphia hatte.

Mike Cox, ehemaliger Leitender Berater in der Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), der US-Umweltschutzbehörde. Sein Kündigungsschreiben ist eine echte Bombe.

Quelle: Stephen Voss

Mike, Angestellte in der Umweltschutzbehörde haben mit politischen Personalentscheidungen oft zu kämpfen. Warum glaubst du, ist die Situation jetzt noch viel schwieriger?

Mike Cox: Ich habe unter sechs verschiedenen Präsidenten gearbeitet, von Ronald Reagan bis zu diesem hier, und es gab oft Meinungsverschiedenheiten. Aber niemals hatte ich das Gefühl, dass jemand neu in die Behörde kam, um diese auseinanderzunehmen.

Aber genau das Gefühl hat uns Scott Pruitt, der jetzige Direktor der Umweltschutzbehörde, vom ersten Tag an vermittelt. (Vierzehnmal hatte Scott Pruitt die Behörde vor seinem Amtsantritt bereits verklagt, Anm. d. Red) Er setzte eine Betriebsversammlung an und es war klar, dass er auf uns herabsah. Wir waren die EPA, die Umweltschutzbehörde. Wir waren die Bösen. Wir waren das Problem. Mein Gott, ich spreche von der EPA immer noch als ""uns“.

Die Gewohnheit legt man nur schwer ab.

Cox: Ja, das sind immer noch ""wir“. Der neue Direktor erklärte also, wir müssten mit den Bundesstaaten zusammenarbeiten. Ich habe dreißig Jahre in der Behörde gearbeitet und wir haben jeden Tag mit den Bundesstaaten zusammengearbeitet. Pruitt sagte, wir müssten uns an die Gesetze halten – als ob wir das nicht getan hätten.

Es war das fundamentale Gefühl, dass er unsere Arbeit nicht verstand. Oder falls er sie doch verstand, dass er es auf uns abgesehen hatte.

Das Zweite waren die Budgetkürzungen. Er verfolgte den Plan, die Stellen in der EPA um 30 Prozent zu kürzen. Außerdem sollten die Klimaschutzprogramme gestrichen werden.

Die Leute fragten sich, wie der Direktor der Umweltschutzbehörde nur erklären könne, der Klimaschutz sei kein Teil unserer Mission? Wir hatten das Gefühl, dass der Kern unserer Arbeit - ich möchte nicht ""zerstört“ sagen - aber untergraben werden sollte.

Zum Schluss möchte ich noch sagen, dass Pruitt Senator James Inhofes früheren Büroleiter eingestellt hat, um die Umweltschutzbehörde zu leiten. (Senator James Inhofe ist derjenige, der die globale Erwärmung ""widerlegt“ hat, indem er einen Schneeball mit in den Senat brachte. ""Es ist sehr sehr kalt draußen. Ganz untypisch für diese Jahreszeit“, so Inhofe, Anm. d. Red).

Das hat mir gereicht. Mann, das ist wirklich übel.

Gab es einen bestimmten ""Jetzt reicht es, ich kündige!“-Moment?

Cox: Ich will ganz ehrlich sein. Im Februar sollte ich in Rente gehen. Ich war fest davon überzeugt, dass Hillary Clinton gewinnen würde, ich dann in Rente gehen und jemand anderes meine Arbeit zum Klimawandel weiterführen würde. Alles wäre großartig.

Dann gewann Trump, und als ich mich auf meinen Ruhestand vorbereitete, kamen immer mehr Menschen auf mich zu und sagten ""Mike, du kannst jetzt nicht in Rente gehen. Dein Job fällt dann weg und du bist ein Verfechter des Klimaschutzes, wir brauchen dich.“

Letztendlich entschied ich mich doch für den Ruhestand. Und das bereue ich ehrlich gesagt. Ich wünschte, ich wäre geblieben. Auch wenn ich glaube, dass ich nicht viel hätte bewirken können, so wäre ich doch eine Stimme gewesen. Und wenn man mich entlassen hätte, dann wäre das in Ordnung gewesen.

Ned Price ist ein ehemaliger CIA-Agent und Sprecher des Nationalen Sicherheitsrates. Er unterrichtet jetzt an der George Washington University und verfasst Beiträge für den Sender MSNBC.

Quelle: Stephen Voss

Ned, wie auch Walt arbeitest du für eine Institution, die eigentlich über der Politik steht. Aber Spannungen mit einer neuen Regierung sind nichts Ungewöhnliches bei der CIA. Warum war das jetzt etwas Anderes?

Ned Price: Während der Übergangszeit von Bush zu Obama habe ich am Counterterrorism Center, dem Anti-Terror-Zentrum, gearbeitet. Ich habe mich immer für einen sehr fortschrittlichen Menschen gehalten, besonders, was soziale Belange betraf.

Aber die Wahlkampf-Rhetorik des damaligen Präsidentschaftskandidaten Barack Obama löste bei mir manches Mal Unbehagen aus. Ich hatte die Befürchtung, dass die Taktiken und die Strategien, die uns so große Erfolge im Kampf gegen Gruppen wie Al-Kaida eingebracht hatten, geändert werden könnten, und dass der CIA und andere Sicherheitsorganisationen in diesem Kampf so die Hände gebunden wären.

Aber wir stellten fest, dass Präsident Obama jemand war, der tat, was getan werden musste. Und dabei blieb er immer noch seinen Kernüberzeugungen treu. Überzeugungen, denen, so denke ich, auch viele von uns zustimmten: Ein Ende der Bestrafungstaktik und der klare Standpunkt, dass die CIA nichts tun würde, was auch nur im Entferntesten als Folter beschrieben werden könnte.

Spulen wir also mal vor bis zum Januar. Was war das für eine Erfahrung?

Price: Für mich begann es schon während des Wahlkampfes, als ich hörte, dass der Präsidentschaftskandidat Donald Trump die Geheimdienste wiederholt sehr scharf attackierte und angriff. Es war nicht nur die Tatsache, dass er Wikileaks zitierte. Es war auch nicht nur die Tatsache, dass er die Geheimdienste mit den Nazis verglich. Das alles kann man noch als rhetorische Ausschmückungen abtun.

Aber er schob hoch-vertrauliche Analysen der Geheimdienste zu Themen wie dem russischen Eingreifen in die Wahl einfach beiseite und bezeichnete sie als Fake News, als einen Witz.

Dass er der großen Verantwortung, die das Amt des Obersten Befehlshabers mit sich bringt, nicht den geringsten Respekt zollte, wurde besonders deutlich, als er am ersten Tag seiner Amtszeit das Hauptquartier der CIA in Langley besuchte.

Er stand vor der Memory Wall - der Wand, die an die CIA-Officer erinnert, die im Dienst ihr Leben gelassen hatten - und sprach über die Zuschauermenge bei seiner Amtseinführung. Er machte Witze darüber, in den Irak zurückzukehren und den Irakern das Öl zu stehlen. Einer meiner Mentoren hat auch einen Platz an dieser Wand, ebenso wie viele ehemalige Kollegen.

Ab wann hast du darüber nachgedacht, zu kündigen?

Price: Das Fass zum Überlaufen brachte für mich das Memorandum, das Steve Bannon als Chef des Nationalen Sicherheitsrates vorsah. Damit wurden der Direktor der CIA wie auch der Vorsitzende der Joint Chiefs of Staff, der Stabschefs, einem militärischen Beratungsgremium des US-Präsidenten, aus dem Principals Committee, der innere Kreis der Sicherheitsrats, entfernt.

Für mich stand fest, dass ich es hier mit einer Regierung zu tun haben würde, die auf politische Berater und Ideologen setzte. Als Analytiker des Geheimdienstes würde ich von nun an entweder den ganzen Tag nur Däumchen drehen oder Berichte verfassen, die allerhöchstens bessere Staubfänger waren.

""Ich befürchtete, dass ich nur noch Schönfärberei betreiben würde, um Korruption zu verbergen.“ – Walter Shaub

Was ist all diesen Geschichten gemein?

McGowan: Ich denke, man bemühte sich, für jede Regierungsbehörde den Kandidaten für die Leitungsebene auszuwählen, der für die Behörde am unangenehmsten sein würde. Es war das dekonstruktive Mantra, den jeweiligen Behörden zu signalisieren, wie wenig man die Arbeit und die Mitarbeiter wertschätzt.

Cox: Ich vergleiche das hier nicht mit dem Auftritt bei der Memorial Wall, aber der Präsident kam im März für einen Besuch in die Umweltschutzbehörde. Am Tag seines Besuches ging an alle Mitarbeiter eine Mitteilung raus: Der Tag wurde ""Unser großer Tag“ genannt werden.

Weiter stand darin, dass der Präsident alle Klimaschutzmaßnahmen, die unter Barack Obama erarbeitet worden waren, rückgängig machen würde. Und dass sollte ""Unser großer Tag“ sein?

McGowan: Richtig, aber wer ist hier ""unser“?

Cox: Ein weiterer roter Faden, der sich offenbar durch all unsere Erfahrungen zieht, ist, dass es sich hier um Menschen handelt, die nicht interessiert sind an anderen Meinungen.

Oft wurde nach Hintergrundinformationen zu einem bestimmten Thema gefragt, es sollte Folgetreffen geben. Diese Treffen fanden aber nie statt.

Als es an der Zeit war, eine Entscheidung zu treffen, haben Pruitt und seine engsten Mitarbeiter einfach getan, was sie ohnehin tun wollten und das war’s. Und die Umweltschutzbehörde ist eine wissenschaftliche Organisation! Wir müssen Fakten zu schätzen wissen! Selbst während der Bush-Präsidentschaft war es anders.

Price: Die Gemeinsamkeit, die mir sofort auffällt, ist, das keiner von uns in diese Situation geraten wollte. Wenn ich mal von mir selbst spreche, dann kann ich sagen, dass ich meine Arbeit geliebt habe. Ich war sehr zufrieden mit der Aussicht, für den Rest meines Lebens ein Bürokrat zu sein. Und ich hoffe, dass ich in den öffentlichen Dienst zurückkehren kann, wenn sich die Großwetterlage gebessert hat.

Shaub: Ich glaube, meine Erfahrung unterscheidet sich da etwas. Oder zumindest mein Fokus. Ich bin nicht so auf die politische Perspektive fokussiert. Meine Sorge gilt dem, was ich den ""Container"" nenne. Ich sehe die repräsentativen Strukturen der Regierung als den Container, die Politik ist das, was man in dem Container lagert.

Mich beunruhigt der Angriff auf diesen Container. Wenn man einen Präsidenten hat, der immer seine finanziellen Interessen im Auge behält, dann weiß man nie, worauf sich seine Entscheidungen gründen, selbst wenn man ihn unterstützt.

Und das wird besonders deutlich, wenn man sieht, wie er den türkischen Präsidenten Erdogan dafür lobt, dass er seine Macht immer weiter ausbaut oder den mörderischen Präsidenten der Philippinen, Rodrigo Duterte, nach Washington einlädt. Trump hat immer noch Immobilieninteressen in der Türkei und auf den Philippinen.

Aber eine Gemeinsamkeit, die mir auffällt, ist der Unwille, auf Experten zu hören. Wir haben an Lösungen gearbeitet. Lasst uns also nochmal auf die finanziellen Interessen des Präsidenten zurückkommen. Ich habe wiederholt gesagt, dass er seine Immobilien verkaufen müsse. Aber selbst wenn er sich geweigert hätte, hätten wir eine Lösung finden können, den größten Schaden zu begrenzen.

Es hätte zum Beispiel kein Regierungsmitarbeiter an einer Veranstaltung teilnehmen dürfen, die in einer Immobilie stattfindet, die zur Trump-Marke oder Trump persönlich gehört. Das hätte vielleicht auch Kuwait, Bahrain oder andere Länder davon abgehalten, dort Veranstaltungen abzuhalten.

Es hätte vielleicht auch Politiker und Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen davon abgehalten, dort zu Benefizveranstaltungen einzuladen, denn sie hätten gewusst, dass kein einziger Mitarbeiter aus dem Weißen Haus gekommen wäre.

Wir hätten außerdem empfehlen können, dass der Präsident sich am bisherigen Umgang mit Vetternwirtschaft orientiert, statt dass das Justizministerium seine über Jahrzehnte gefestigte Haltung zur Vetternwirtschaft über den Haufen wirft.

Wenn also das Weiße Haus mir den Schwarzen Peter zuschiebt und behauptet, ich hätte versucht, sie zu untergraben, dann sage ich: Wenn sie sich an meine Empfehlungen gehalten hätten, dann wären sie in einer stärkeren Position gewesen.

Quelle: Stephen Voss

Walt, ich habe gehört, dass du eine mentale Check-Liste hattest, die dir bei deiner Entscheidung helfen sollte?

Shaub: Ja, es handelte sich dabei um eine Checkliste aus drei Teilen, die ich auch anderen empfehle. Zuerst die Frage: Kann ich die Mission effektiv erfüllen? Dann die Frage: Kann ich meine Arbeit ethisch und moralisch verrichten? Und die dritte Frage: Kann ich die Wahrheit sagen?

Ich habe mich sicherlich nie gescheut, die Wahrheit zu sagen. Ich hatte auch das Gefühl, dass ich meine Mission moralisch und ethisch gut erfüllt habe. Aber ich war an einem Punkt angelangt, an dem ich das Gefühl hatte, die Mission nicht effektiv erfüllen zu können. Diese Frage habe ich mir über Monate hinweg gestellt. Und ich bin geblieben, denn ich hatte das Gefühl, dass noch nicht alles verloren war.

Zum Beispiel hört man trotz dieser ganzen Privat-Jet-Sache (Shaun bezieht sich auf die offensichtliche Allergie einiger Kabinettsmitglieder gegen kommerzielle Flüge, Anm. d. Red) gar nichts über den finanziellen Interessenkonflikt einiger Kabinettsmitglieder. Das liegt daran, dass das OGE, das Büro für Regierungsethik, auch ohne die Unterstützung des Weißen Hauses Erfolg hatte.

Ich habe persönlich mit einem Kandidaten gesprochen, der unheimlich wohlhabend und erfolgreich ist, und ich sagte ihm: ""Sie sind zu Ihrem Ruhm und Wohlstand gekommen, weil Sie ein begabter Verhandlungsführer sind. Aber das Schlimmste, was Ihnen jetzt passieren könnte, ist, dass Sie all Ihre Fähigkeiten nutzen und mich erfolgreich dazu bewegen, mich zurückzuziehen.“

Letztendlich stimmte die Person zu, den Großteil ihres Besitzes zu veräußern. Das war keine einfache Entscheidung für diese Person und ich rechne es ihr sehr hoch an.

Andere Kabinettsmitglieder waren uns gegenüber feindseliger eingestellt. Aber letztendlich waren wir im Umgang mit ihnen voll in unserem Element. Außerdem hatten wir in den von den Kabinettsmitgliedern selbst bezahlten Anwälten Verbündete, die ihnen rieten, dass das ein sehr sinnvolles Vorgehen sei.

Einen ähnlichen Erfolg hatten wir, als wir darum kämpften, die Ethik-Ausnahmegenehmigungen, die das Weiße Haus ausstellte, in unseren Besitz zu bekommen. (Diese Ausnahmegenehmigungen erlauben es Regierungsmitarbeitern, bestimmte Ethikvorschriften zu umgehen. Die Trump-Regierung hat einige dieser Papiere heimlich ausgehändigt, Anm. d. Red)

Das Weiße Haus hat sich gegen uns einen Monat lang in aller Öffentlichkeit gewehrt, aber letztendlich war der Druck der Öffentlichkeit zu groß und die Ausnahmegenehmigungen wurden uns ausgehändigt.

Die größte Überraschung folgte aber, als ich die Papiere zu Gesicht bekam. Viele waren nicht unterschrieben, nicht datiert und entweder explizit oder implizit rückwirkend. Wenn man eine rückwirkende Ausnahmegenehmigung benötigt, dann heißt das, dass man ein Gesetzt gebrochen hat.

Zusätzlich waren zwei der Papiere für eine Gruppe von Angestellten bestimmt, zu denen auch die Person gehörte, die die Dokumente ausstellte. Diese Person hat sich also selbst eine Ausnahmegenehmigung ausgestellt.

Da begriff ich, dass diesen Menschen einfach alles zuzutrauen war. Und sie hatten sich darauf vorbereitet, dass ich mit den Verstößen an die Öffentlichkeit gehen würde, indem sie das Ethikbüro einfach ausschalteten.

Das brachte mich in die Position, dass ich einige veröffentlichungspflichtige Angaben zum Einkommen von Mitarbeitern des Weißen Hauses würde zertifizieren müssen, ohne zu wissen, womit diese Personen tatsächlich ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienen. Ich befürchtete, einen Deckmantel über Korruption breiten zu müssen.

Wie ist die Beziehung zu euren früheren Kollegen jetzt?

McGowan: Seit ich gekündigt habe, habe ich viele E-Mails bekommen. Nicht nur von meinen Kollegen aus der Abteilung für Bürgerrechte, sondern auch von anderen Mitarbeitern. Sie alle sagten mir, dass sie so froh sind, dass ich diesen Weg gegangen bin.

Viele wollen ebenfalls kündigen, aber das ist eine so schwierige und persönliche Entscheidung. Manche sind die Alleinverdiener in ihren Familien. Andere machen sich Sorgen, wer ihren Platz einnehmen könnte, wenn sie tatsächlich gehen.

Manche beschreiben die aktuelle Situation tatsächlich wie ein Ertrinken: Wie lange kann ich meinen Kopf noch über Wasser halten? Ich möchte die Scherben gerne wieder zusammensetzen, wenn all das hier einmal vorbei ist.

Wenn ich mit meinen ehemaligen Kollegen über meine Entscheidung spreche, dann tue ich das schweren Herzens und mit sehr viel Feingefühl, denn ich möchte nicht leichtfertig und überheblich wirken. Ich wusste einfach, dass ich mit meiner Arbeit und meiner Leidenschaft in einer Stelle, die sich stärker durch Widerstand auszeichnet, mehr erreichen könnte.

Ich erkannte auch, dass ich ein großes Privileg hatte. Ich weiß, dass viele, die noch in diesem Apparat arbeiten, damit zu kämpfen haben, sich ihre Integrität und ihren Stolz zu bewahren. Ich finde es wichtig, sie zu ermutigen und sie wissen zu lassen, dass sie das Gute und Richtige in der Welt nicht verraten.

""Ich wünschte, ich wäre geblieben. Denn auch, wenn ich vielleicht nicht viel hätte ausrichten können, so wäre ich doch eine Stimme gewesen.“ – Mike Cox

Price: Ich war in einer ähnlichen Situation. Als ich bereit war zu kündigen, machte ich mir keine Gedanken um die Trolle auf Twitter oder darüber, wie die Personen in der gegenwärtigen Regierung reagieren würden. Die meisten Sorgen mache ich mir darum, dass meine früheren Kollegen denken könnten, ich hielte mich für heiliger als der Papst.

Es ist daher unheimlich schön, dass sie mich immer noch als ein Teammitglied betrachten. Für sie bin ich jemand, der immer noch ihre Interessen verfolgt.

Shaub: Für mich gleicht das eher einem kalten Entzug. 15 Jahre habe ich mit diesen Menschen zusammengearbeitet. Und auch wenn ich theoretisch natürlich weiterhin zu ihnen Kontakt haben darf, so habe ich doch Angst davor, dass ein Foto in der Zeitung erscheinen könnte, das uns bei einem gemeinsamen Lunch zeigt und man mich beschuldigen könnte, geheime Informationen weiterzugeben.

Deshalb bleibe ich auf Abstand. Ich vermisse sie einfach nur sehr, das ist der menschliche Faktor hier.

Cox: Ich habe eine Frage: Kommen Mitarbeiter deiner Organisation mit der Bitte auf dich zu, eine bestimmte Sache näher zu erläutern?

Price: Meine ehemaligen Kollegen sind in einer schwierigen Situation, denn sie werden in geheime Angelegenheiten eingeweiht und ich nicht. Und natürlich haben sie keine geheimen Informationen an mich weitergegeben, aber sie sprechen über allgemeinere Dinge wie die Arbeitsmoral in der Geheimdienstgemeinde, was sich in Personaldingen im Nationalen Sicherheitsrat tut, oder wo es auch im Weißen Haus zu Unklarheiten kommt.

Was ich feststelle, ist eine tiefsitzende Paranoia. Niemand schreibt mir einfach so mal oder ruft kurz an. Sie beginnen eine Unterhaltung damit, zu fragen, ob ich bei Signal oder bei WhatsApp bin. Such dir einen verschlüsselten Messenger aus, sagen sie. Am nächsten Tag bekomme ich dann eine Nachricht bei Signal mit dem Wortlaut ""Hey wie geht’s, ich wollte nur mal kurz Hallo sagen.“

Shaub: Sie sprechen nur über persönliche Dinge?

Price: Genau. Es werden keine geheimen oder sensiblen Informationen ausgeplaudert.

McGowan: Da ist immer das Gefühl, dass es schon beängstigend ist, nur mit jemandem gesehen zu werden, der gekündigt hat.

""Ich war sehr zufrieden mit der Aussicht, für den Rest meines Lebens ein Bürokrat zu sein. Und ich hoffe, dass ich in den öffentlichen Dienst zurückkehren kann, wenn sich die Großwetterlage gebessert hat.“ – Ned Price

Gab es wenigstens ein wenig guten Galgenhumor, bevor du gegangen bist?

McGowan: In der Woche nach der Wahl habe ich einem Freund von mir geschrieben. Mit ihm bin ich auch schon einmal aneinander geraten. Ich habe ihn gefragt, ob er schon an seinem Korematsu arbeitet. (Ein umstrittener Fall des Obersten Gerichtshofs. Der US-Regierung wurde es gestattet, während des Zweiten Weltkriegs japanisch-stämmige Amerikaner in Lagern zu internieren, Anm. d. Red.)

""Das ist nicht witzig“ war seine Antwort. Und ich sagte: ""Ich weiß, dass das nicht witzig ist.“

Ich frage mich, ob das abschreckend auf junge Menschen wirken könnte, die eine Karriere im öffentlichen Dienst anstreben.

McGowan: Ich werde nicht müde zu betonen, was für ein toller Job die Regierungsarbeit ist und wie viele Möglichkeiten sie einem bietet. Zumindest war das bei mir der Fall. Immer, wenn jemand von der Regierung als 'The Man' spricht, dann antwortete ich scherzhaft, dass der Mann anscheinend eine 1,60 Meter große Lesbe aus Queens ist. Wenn ich also 'The Man' sein kann, dann kann das jeder.

Aber jetzt ist es sehr viel schwieriger geworden, Menschen davon zu überzeugen, dass die Arbeit für die Regierung eine wirkliche Erfüllung sein kann.

Ich weiß, dass die Macht der Bundesregierung dazu genutzt wird, so viel Schlimmes anzurichten, zum Beispiel Familien auseinanderzureißen oder zu diskriminieren. Da finde ich es sehr unsensibel, jetzt bei jemandem für die Regierungsarbeit zu werben, der selber zu der Gruppe Menschen gehört, die unter den Entscheidungen der Regierung leidet. Ich freue mich schon auf den Tag, an dem das alles wieder vorbei ist.

Shaub: Mir bereitet diese Abschreckung große Sorgen. Ich möchte hier die Gelegenheit ergreifen, junge Menschen zu ermutigen, eine Karriere im öffentlichen Dienst anzustreben. Es gibt so viele verschiedene Möglichkeiten. Es gibt regionale Regierungen, die Regierungen der Bundesstaaten, Non-Profit-Organisationen und natürlich die Bundesregierung.

Die Arbeit für die Regierung kann ich immer noch sehr empfehlen. Junge Menschen beginnen hier auf einer niedrigen Stufe, aus einigen Turbulenzen werden sie so herausgehalten. Aber trotzdem übernehmen sie schon früh eine sehr große Verantwortung. Und sie können wirklich etwas erreichen, indem sie sich dem Dienst für ein ganzes Land verschreiben.

Der öffentliche Dienst ist wirklich eine Belohnung an sich. Also, ich zahle immer noch meinen Studentenkredit ab, da will ich doch schwer hoffen, dass sich der öffentliche Dienst bezahlt macht.

1.- En los altares se representa el inframundo, la tierra y el cielo, por lo que tu altar deberá de tener 3 niveles.
2.- Primero debes preparar el nivel del inframundo, que debe de ser a nivel del piso, o el más bajo que haya.
También se ponen veladoras encendidas que sirven para guiar a nuestros muertos y se decora con papel picado blanco y morado, que representan la pureza y el luto.
No olvides el pan de muertosPrimero debes preparar el nivel del inframundo, que debe de ser a nivel del piso, o el más bajo que haya.","El Día de Muertos se celebra en Mesoamérica desde tiempos prehispánicos, y hoy en día esta fiesta se sigue celebrando en México para honrar a nuestros difuntos, recordarlos y esperar su visita.

Esta tradicional celebración es una mezcal entre creencias místicas y religiosas y fusiona fiestas católicas del Día de Todos los Santos —celebrada el 1 de noviembre para recordar a todas las almas que después de haber estado en el purgatorio se han purificado— y el culto celebrado durante el mes de agosto de los pueblos indígenas para compartir la cosecha anual con sus queridos difuntos que habitaban en Mictlán.

Para las comunidades indígenas, la muerta era tan solo el inicio de un largo viaje, por lo que los difuntos eran enterrados con todo lo que les gustaba en vida. En su visita anual desde del inframundo, las almas regresan para volver a disfrutar de los placeres terrenales.

Ellos vienen desde lejos, y para recibirlos nosotros preparamos un altar de muertos.

Aquí te dejo una guía sobre todos lo que necesitas para montar uno y darle la bienvenida a tus seres cercanos que ya no están en el plano terrenal.

1.- En los altares se representa el inframundo, la tierra y el cielo, por lo que tu altar deberá de tener 3 niveles.

2.- Primero debes preparar el nivel del inframundo, que debe de ser a nivel del piso, o el más bajo que haya. Aquí este se representa la tumba con una cruz. Te recomiendo que formes con flores de cempasúchil. También se ponen veladoras encendidas que sirven para guiar a nuestros muertos y se decora con papel picado blanco y morado, que representan la pureza y el luto.

3.- El nivel medio —que puede ser montado en un mesa— representa la tierra, es en esta parte donde dejamos la comida y bebida favorita de nuestros difuntos. Aquí no hay reglas: prepara los platillos que más le gustaban a esa persona que vendrá a visitarte (no olvides dejarle su tequilita, mezcalito, o lo que más le encataba tomar). Las tradicionales calaveritas de azúcar endulzan el festejo. Dejar un platito con sal es importante, para purificar su alma y evitar que se corrompan. No olvides el pan de muertos

Primero debes preparar el nivel del inframundo, que debe de ser a nivel del piso, o el más bajo que haya.

4.- El último nivel representa el cielo y debe de estar por encima del nivel anterior. Te recomiendo poner una cajita sobre la mesa que sirvió de base para el segundo nivel. Aquí pon una cruz o imágenes de santos, el incenciario con copal y más veladoras.

5.- Finalmente coloca al centro del altar la foto del difunto que te visitará. Claro que si esperas a más de uno puedas poner a todos en un mismo altar (no olvides dejar comida para cada uno de ellos).

He aquí también una lista de creencias de algunos pueblos indígenas y datos curiosos que te ayudarán a comprender mejor el significado de este festejo:

- Los nahuas creen que el alma es guiada por el olor de la comida, por lo que los platillos que se dejan en el altar deben de estar muy condimentados y muy calientitos.

- Los niños nos visitan primero y llegan el 1 de noviembre, los adultos nos visitan el 2 de noviembre.

- Los mayas creen que la muerte nos acompaña todo el tiempo, y nos alerta en caso de peligro. La celebración del Día de Muertos también es un recordatorio para los vivos, que todo es vida, y la muerte es parte de ella.

- Los zapotecos elaboran pan en forma de hombres y mujeres, y de niños para recordar a sus difuntos.

From pioneering scientists to bestselling authors, trailblazing politicians to celebrated entertainers (and some straight-up trans icons too) this book features letters of sisterly advice from almost 100 incredible trans women.

It's an achievement to simply survive in this world as a trans woman, but as the women in this book show, not only do we survive, we thrive.","If you've watched this week's episodes of New Activists, you'll know my book To My Trans Sisters, is finally out! It's the most surreal thing ever! It all started last year, when I was fortunate enough to be offered a book deal by Jessica Kingsley Publishers after I topped The Observer's New Radicals List. I was also fortunate enough to be given free reign with the book, so when it came to deciding what I wanted it to be about, I began by asking myself what I felt my community needed, and answered that question by asking myself what I needed when I began my own transition.

I decided to create the book I wish I had at the start of my transition.

Those early days were really tough- I didn't know any other trans people when I first began transitioning back in 2013, so I didn't have a big sister figure in my life to do what a big sister is supposed to do: help me with my make-up, give me dating advice, teach me how be a strong woman. This is the case for most trans people. Transition is hard enough, but it's harder when you have go through it alone.

On top of this, back then, prior to the trans tipping point of 2014/15, there were very few positive representations of trans people in the media, if any. So as well as not having anyone in my immediate circles to look up to and learn from, I didn't really have anyone in the media to do this to either. I was desperate for information and inspiration. I wanted to create a book that was a source of these two things, and a source of sisterly advice for the next generation of girls.

So I began reaching out to the women who'd I'd researched and looked up to throughout my own transition, asking them if they'd share a letter of advice to girls at the start of their transitions... and to my surprise a few of them got back to me. Almost 100 in fact!

From pioneering scientists to bestselling authors, trailblazing politicians to celebrated entertainers (and some straight-up trans icons too) this book features letters of sisterly advice from almost 100 incredible trans women. It's an encyclopaedia of trans excellence.

It was important for me that this book was a source of inspiration as well as just a source of information, which is why I asked the women I did. I wanted the reader, to be able to draw inspiration not only from the women's letters but also from the women themselves, so each letter is accompanied by a bio I've written up detailing the incredible impact each woman has had on the world. Positive representation is so important. Like I said, prior to the 'trans tipping point' of 2014/15 there were very few positive representations of trans people in the mainstream- the only time you really saw girls like us in the media was either as a punch-line or a punching-bag. This negative representation has a damaging effect on both the way the public perceive us, but more importantly the way we perceive ourselves. We are more than punch-lines and punching-bags, we have literally changed the world. From 80 year old tech pioneer Lynn Conway who's inventions changed the way the world works to America's Next Top Model's Isis King who changed the world see us as trans people.

The letters and advice are as different as the contributors themselves, but there is one common thing that every letter in the book possesses and every woman in the book possesses; resilience. Almost all the letters contain stories of prejudice, rejection, hate - but despite all the hardship girls like us face, we still choose to exist, bravely, boldly and beautifully. It's an achievement to simply survive in this world as a trans woman, but as the women in this book show, not only do we survive, we thrive.

Sanders’ statement comes as recent reports of sexual misconduct have inspired individuals across industries to speak out against sexual assault. An article published by The New York Times about film executive Harvey Weinstein’s alleged sexual harassment sparked the movement. On Weinstein, Trump said he was “not at all surprised to see it,” but did not remark on the victims.

Spacey hat sich inzwischen auf Twitter als schwul geoutet

Man kennt Kevin Spacey als mobbenden Chef in “Kill the Boss”, als betrügerischen Professor in “21” und natürlich als tyrannischen US-Präsidenten in der Serie “House of Cards”. Privat jedoch weiß man wenig über den Schauspieler.

Nun werden schwere Anschuldigungen gegen ihn laut: Der zweifache Oscargewinner soll 1986 einen 14-Jährigen sexuell belästigt haben.

Anthony Rapp, seinerseits Darsteller in der neuen Netflix-Serie “Star Trek Discovery”, berichtet im Interview mit ""Buzzfeed"", dass Spacey ihn auf einer Party hochgehoben und aufs Bett geworfen habe. Dann habe der ältere Branchenkollege sich auf ihn drauf gelegt.

Rapp: “Bin froh, dass nichts Schlimmeres passiert ist”

Bei Spaceys Anblick “dreht sich mir der Magen um”, sagt Rapp 30 Jahre später. “Es ist mir heute noch unbegreiflich, was damals passiert ist. Es verwirrt mich zutiefst.”

Die beiden Männer lernten sich auf einer After-Show-Party kennen. Der 14-jährige Rapp stand damals im Theaterstück “Precious Sons” am New Yorker Broadway auf der Bühne, Spacey in “Eines langen Tages Reise in die Nacht”. Die Theatergemeinschaft ist gut vernetzt. Man kennt sich, feiert zusammen Parties, tauscht sich aus.

Deshalb sei es ihm auch nicht seltsam vorgekommen, als der 26-jährige Spacey ihn zu einer Party in seiner Wohnung einlud, sagt Rapp gegenüber ""Buzzfeed"". Seine Mutter habe ihn manchmal auf Veranstaltungen begleitet; zu Spaceys Party jedoch ging der junge Mann alleine.

Weil er niemanden auf der Party kannte, habe er sich in Spaceys Schlafzimmer zurückgezogen und Fernsehen geschaut. Dann sei Spacey zu ihm ins Zimmer gekommen. “Erst in diesem Moment habe ich bemerkt, dass alle anderen Gäste gegangen waren”, so Rapp. Er habe sich aus Spaceys Umklammerung “herauswinden” können und die Wohnung verlassen.

“Je älter ich werde, desto mehr wird mir klar, dass ich froh sein kann, dass nichts schlimmeres passiert ist”, erzählt Rapp im Interview.

Spacey outet sich als schwul

Spacey hat inzwischen auf Twitter Stellung zu den Vorwürfen bezogen. Er schreibt, er könne sich an den Vorfall “ehrlich nicht erinnern”, räumt jedoch ein, dass es sich um “unangemessenes betrunkenes Verhalten” gehandelt haben müsse. “Wenn ich mich damals so verhalten habe, wie er es beschreibt, dann schulde ich ihm die aufrichtigste Entschuldigung” so Spacey.

Gleichzeitig nahm Spacey Rapps Anschuldigungen zum Anlass, sich als homosexuell zu outen. “Ich habe mein ganzes Leben über Beziehungen zu Männern und Frauen gehabt”, offenbart der “House of Cards”-Star. Nun habe er sich aber entschlossen, als schwuler Mann zu leben.

L'épisode 2 intitulé ""Les Damnés"" diffusé sur OCS ce lundi doit nous replonger dans la guerre que se livrent les deux camps. Quid de l'avancée des troupes?

ATTENTION SPOILERS

Vous êtes bien sûr de vouloir continuer?

Alors c'est parti !

La saison 7 de ""Walking Dead"" avait été quelque peu tancée par les fans, certains jugeant cette dernière trop calme, trop lente et plus globalement trop molle. Il va sans dire que ce cycle 8 détonne par son rythme plus dynamique. L'épisode 2 nous en livre une nouvelle illustration.

Le premier épisode de cette saison se terminait sur une scène relativement cocasse. Après avoir voulu aider Grégory (qui s'en est finalement sorti en fuyant grâce à une voiture), le père Gabriel était contraint de se réfugier dans une cabane entourée par des zombies affamés. Ce dernier se retrouvait face au terrible Negan, lui aussi présent dans cet abri.

Rien n'a changé par rapport à la semaine passée: Rick et ses potes sont toujours aussi déterminés à mettre leur plan à exécution (qui pourrait en douter à l'heure actuelle?). L'objectif est d'éliminer les Sauveurs et surtout le redoutable Negan incarné par Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

Parti tambour battant, l'épisode 2 débute par des scènes de guerre. On comprend rapidement la tactique mise en place par Rick: attaquer simultanément les différentes places fortes détenues par les Sauveurs. Divisés en plusieurs équipes menées par un personnage emblématique à chaque fois (Jesus et Tara, Ezekiel et Carol, entre autres), les amis de Rick ont pour mission de capturer les postes clés leur permettant de prendre le dessus sur leurs adversaires.

Les vingt premières minutes de cet épisode 2 sont largement consacrées à ces séquences. Globalement, tout se passe comme prévu, les Sauveurs sont éliminés tour à tour, sans être en mesure d'opposer de résistance. Seuls ceux établis dans le QG de Negan et commandés par Mara livrent une défense digne de ce nom, les balles entre les deux camps pleuvent.

Morgan se déchaîne

Mais comme vous le savez pertinemment, rien ne se passe comme prévu dans ""The Walking Dead"" (pour changer). La première ""surprise"" intervient dans la base satellite. Alors que le groupe mené par Jesus, Tara et Morgan semble bien parti dans son expédition, une petite équipe de Sauveurs parvient à riposter. On pense alors au drame et à la mort de Morgan.

Finalement, l'homme au bâton qui soulignait quelques instants plus tôt son immortalité (rien que ça) se réveille, prêt à repartir au combat. Une issue favorable non-partagée par Mara qui finit mordue à la gorge par un ancien Sauveur transformé en zombie.

That went well #TWD pic.twitter.com/82CPqWNm8P — The Walking Dead AMC (@WalkingDead_AMC) 30 octobre 2017

Miraculé, au contraire de ses deux coéquipiers, Morgan apparaît sous un autre jour. Un silencieux à la main, il réussit à éliminer froidement une quinzaine de Sauveurs (belle perf pour quelqu'un qui déteste les armes à feu). Les acolytes de Negan encore vivants sont pris au piège et acceptent de déposer les armes.

Pendant ce temps, Rick et Daryl cherchent des fusils d'assaut dans un bâtiment tenu par les Sauveurs. Certaines scènes leur rappellent à tous deux des événements passés. A ce titre, Daryl se revoit prisonnier (souvenez-vous la saison précédente), une époque pas si lointaine.

L'épisode précédent s'était terminé par la capture du père Gabriel par Negan, celui-ci s'inscrit dans la même perspective. Après avoir éliminé un Sauveur à la suite d'une bagarre, Rick se retrouve nez-à-nez avec un autre rival bien connu des fans, un certain Morales aperçu... lors de la saison 1. Les retrouvailles entre les deux hommes sont loin d'être amicales et ce dernier oblige Rick à se désarmer.

I know you #TWD pic.twitter.com/13AmIj1eeH — The Walking Dead AMC (@WalkingDead_AMC) 30 octobre 2017

Vous l'aurez compris, pas de Negan dans cet épisode 2. La guerre continue et les affrontements s'intensifient. Néanmoins, certaines dissensions apparaissent. Jesus et Tara connaissent leur premier différend, le premier souhaitant épargner des vies, la seconde ne voulant faire preuve d'une quelconque pitié. Reste à savoir lequel des deux aura raison. Quant à Rick, on attend désormais l'épisode 3 pour connaître son destin.

Malgré plus de 500 millions d'euros engagés par les gouvernements successifs dans les trois précédents plans autisme, les autistes Asperger et de ""haut niveau"" vivent toujours dans la situation dénoncée par le Comité Consultatif National d'Éthique en 2007: ""l'absence de diagnostic précoce, de scolarisation en milieu ordinaire et de socialisation, conduisent à une perte de chances pour les enfants et à une ""maltraitance"" par défaut"".

En France, la prise en charge de l'autisme n'est pas adaptée aux spécificités de l'autisme Asperger et de ""haut niveau"": hospitalisation, médication, exclusion des milieux scolaires et professionnels ordinaires font leur malheur et celui de leur famille. Des diagnostics erronés peuvent entraîner les personnes concernées, ainsi que leur famille, dans des parcours médicaux inadaptés, source de souffrances évitables. La France, comparée à de nombreux pays, présente un réel retard dans l'application de méthodes de diagnostic éprouvées par ailleurs. Notre pays est aussi très déficient en termes d'accompagnement des personnes autistes Asperger et de ""haut niveau"" pour favoriser leur intégration dans la société.

A travers la mise en œuvre d'un 4e plan autisme à partir de 2018, la France a l'occasion de rattraper son retard en matière de diagnostic

Nous sommes également convaincues que des parcours thérapeutiques mieux adaptés permettraient de libérer des places dans les instituts médico-sociaux et réduiraient de façon significative les coûts de prises en charge de ces formes d'autisme, que ce soit pour les familles mais aussi pour la Sécurité sociale.

Nous, co-présidentes de l'association Action pour l'Autisme Asperger, parents et grands-parents d'enfants et d'adultes autistes Asperger ou de ""haut niveau"", espérons vivement que la consultation actuellement menée par Mme Cluzel, secrétaire d'État aux Personnes handicapées, dans le cadre du 4e Plan pour l'autisme saura tenir compte de nos recommandations. La première, la plus essentielle, est de reconnaître le ""droit au diagnostic"" de ces personnes et de la spécificité de leur handicap pour leur offrir des prises en charge thérapeutiques justes et adaptées, afin de leur donner toutes les chances de fréquenter l'école, de trouver un travail et de s'intégrer dans la société.

Essential HuffPost

In response to the Opposition parties' decision to observe November 8 -- the day demonetisation was implemented last year -- as the 'Black Day', the government has decided to celebrate the same as 'anti-Black Money Day'. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that on November 8 this year, all BJP leaders, including union and state ministers, will spend the day attending and organising various programmes which will promote Centre's actions on black money and corruption related issues in the country.

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has appealed to the medical regulators of the country to amend the code of conduct so that doctors are not made to participate in hangings. Usually, a doctor is present at the site where the state carries out an execution to check for signs of life etc. The IMA, following a 2012 World Medical Association resolution said that being a part of executions goes against the grain of a a doctor's job as a healer.

In Maharashtra, 100 farmers who had applied for loan waivers turned out to have the same Aadhaar number. Officials told reporters that now they'll have to check the details of these people manually, which will take a long time and delay the process of waiver.

Main News

The Supreme Court has asked the government to clarify by Monday that they will not resort to coercion regarding the linking of Aadhaar number to various services till a constitution bench makes a decision on the scheme's legitimacy, The Telegraph reported.

The Donald Trump government has made the process of renewing non-immigrant visas like H1-B and L1 more difficult with a new directive that says that the applicant has to bear the burden of proof even when he/she is applying for an extension. A majority of Indian IT professionals working in the US use these visas, reports The Times of India.

Army chief General Bipin Rawat said that Army operations will continue in Jammu and Kashmir, even though the Centre has appointed an interlocutor, reports The Hindu.

Dort gewinnt sie schnell an Einfluss

Eine zentrale Rolle spielt dabei die AfD, die ihren akademischen Nachwuchs an den Unis rekrutiert

Irgendwann wurde es Anne Schäpermeier zu viel.

Unbekannte schmierten wie “Scheiß Islam” und “Merkel muss weg” in Bücher und auf Zettel und verstecken sie in den Regalen der Saarländischen Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek in Saarbrücken und auf Toiletten des Campus'.

""Sowas geht gar nicht"", sagt Schäpermeierm, die den Ausleihbereich leitet und dem Direktorium der Uni-Bibliothek angehört. Sie berichtet von mindestens 15 Fällen.

“Die Bibliothek ist ein Ort für alle - und wir wollen keine diskriminierenden Parolen hier”, sagt sie.

Also stellte sie ein Schild in die Bibliothek auf - um die Studenten auf das Problem aufmerksam zu machen und den oder die Täter zu warnen.

Denn was nach harmlosen Kritzeleien aussieht, bereitet immer mehr Universitäten in Deutschland Sorge.

""Auch die AfD muss sich um ihren akademischen Nachwuchs kümmern""

Zwar gelten Deutschlands Hochschulen noch “eher als eine linke Bastion””, wie der Experte Torsten Bultmann vom Bund demokratischer Wissenschaftler im Gespräch mit der HuffPost sagt - “zumindest, was die Studierendenvertretungen und den sog. akademischen Mittelbau betrifft.”

“Doch diese Bastion droht, zu fallen”, sagt er. “Die rechte Szene stellt sich an den Hochschulen neu auf und gewinnt überraschend schnell an Einfluss.”

Lange Zeit galten alleine die Burschenschaften als wichtigste Anlaufstelle für Rechte. Das ändert sich nun.

Mit den Wahlerfolgen der AfD gewinnt allerdings deren Hochschule-Partei Campusalternative an Bedeutung. Außerdem tritt die Identitären Bewegung immer selbstbewusster unter Studierenden auf.

“Auch die AfD muss sich um ihren akademischen Nachwuchs kümmern”, sagt Experte Bultmann. Eine Partei, die sich etablieren wolle, müsse auch auf Akademiker zugehen.

“Also müssen sie an den Hochschulen Flagge zeigen”, sagt er. In mehreren Unis sitzt die Campus Alternative bereits im Studierendenparlament - etwa an der Fernuni Hagen, in Kiel, Kassel und Düsseldorf.

Bisweilen absurde Vorschläge

Dort machen ihre Vertreter mit bisweilen absurden Vorschlägen auf sich aufmerksam.

In Düsseldorf etwa wurde ein Antrag gestellt, eine Deutschlandfahne auf dem Campus zu hissen und das Genderreferat zu streichen.

In Magdeburg machte die Campus Alternative Schlagzeilen, weil sie den AfD-Landeschef André Poggenburg zu einem Vortrag an die TU lud.

Noch während der Veranstaltung kam es zum Eklat, weil Studenten das Podium stürmten und Poggenburg mit Sicherheitsleuten den Hörsaal verließ.

Angstraum neben dem Campus

Wohl in kaum einer anderen Stadt ist die Nähe der Rechten zur Uni so spürbar wie in Halle an der Saale.

Die Bewegung ""Ein Prozent"", ein Ableger der rechtsextremen Identitären Bewegung, unterhält dort ein Haus direkt gegenüber des Campus'.

Das Haus wurde nicht nur von einem hessischen AfD-Abgeordneten gekauft, außerdem unterhält der AfD-Landtagsabgeordnete Hans-Thomas Tillschneider dort sein Parteibüro.

Der Standort ist bewusst provozierend - und strategisch gewählt, sagt Wanja Seifert vom Bündnis ""Halle gegen Rechts"": ""Das Haus liegt auf dem direkten Weg vieler Studenten.""

Er berichtet von regelmäßigen Angriffen, ""für viele Studenten ist das ein Angstraum, der bewusst gemieden wird.""

Die Inszenierung der Identitären

Auch rechte Burschenschaften spielen ein wichtige Rolle in der Stadt.

So sind die Mitgliederlisten der Identitären und der Burschenschaft Halle-Leobener B! Germania fast identisch.



Einige Burschenschaft dienen als Sammelbecken der Rechten

So entsteht eine gefährliche Allianz aus Identitären, Burschenschaften und der AfD, die auch in anderen Städten zu beobachten ist.

Verbindungsglied ist dabei der Dachverband Deutsche Burschenschaft (DB). ""Die ist ein Sammelbecken für unterschiedliche politische Strömungen der Rechten - vom Konservativismus bis hin zum Neonazismus"", erklärt Alexandra Kurth.

Kurth ist Politikwissenschaftlerin an der Uni Gießen und beschäftigt sich seit Jahren mit den Themen Rechtsextremismus und Burschenschaften.

Sie sagt: ""DB-Burschenschaften sind ein Anknüpfungspunkt für rechte Organisationen. Die Identitären benennen das ganz offen. Sie halten ihre Anhänger dazu an, den Kontakt zu Burschenschaften zu suchen.""

""Geblieben ist nur der harte Kern""

Seit den Abspaltungsprozessen im Jahr 2011 hat sich die DB weiter radikalisiert, viele gemäßigte Burschenschaften sind damals ausgetreten, ""geblieben ist nur der harte Kern"", sagt Kurth.

Das ist zwar objektiv eine - personelle und finanzielle - Schwächung gewesen.

Allerdings wurde die Verkleinerung durch die allgemeine politische Lage und insbesondere durch den Erfolg der AfD zur Stärke.

""Denn dadurch hat sich die Chance für die verblieben Burschenschafter erhöht, von den Ressourcen der AfD zu profitieren"", sagt Kurth. Für sie ist klar: ""Die DB ist ein Personalreservoir für die AfD.""

""Einstellungswelle im Bundestag""

Dabei zeichnet sich ein Trend ab. Bereits etliche AfD-Landtagsabgeordneten hatten eine Reihe von Burschenschaftern eingestellt.

Nun werde es bei den Abgeordneten im Bundestag vermutlich eine ähnliche Einstellungswelle geben, sagt Kurth - ""wo sollen die ganzen wissenschaftlichen Mitarbeiter auch sonst herkommen?""","""Die letzte Bastion der Linken fällt"": Wie AfD, Identitäre und rechte Burschenschaften versuchen, deutsche Unis zu unterwandern",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/29/afd-unis-unterwandern_n_18412832.html?utm_hp_ref=germany#comments

Se hace de noche, cae el Sol, se encienden las luces artificiales y las máquinas empiezan a trabajar. Arranca el proceso de la vendimia nocturna.

Este mes de septiembre, las temperaturas han sido más altas de lo habitual, como ha pasado en años anteriores. Esta climatología destruye el sabor y el aroma de la uva, la cual es preferible recoger en días mas fríos para que pueda mantener su temperatura y evitar la oxidación producida por el calor. Es por ello que cada vez sea más bodegas de toda España esperen a la noche para recoger la uva blanca.

La Bodega Cuatro Rayas, en Valladolid, es una de tantas que vendimian de esta manera tan particular. Perteneciente a la D.O Rueda, sus trabajadores empiezan la recolección una vez se pone el Sol y no paran de hacerlo hasta que aparecen los primeros rayos del día. Pero ya no son los trabajadores quienes cortan los racimos a mano: una gran maquina cosechadora de dos metros es la encargada de pasar entre las hileras para sacudir la planta y recoger todas las uvas.

Una vez terminada la recogida, las vuelcan en depósitos y las trasladan a las bodegas para pasar el control de calidad y enfriarlas con nitrógeno para exprimirlas posteriormente y dejarlas fermentar.

Más de 1.400 viticultores de Rueda trabajan a lo largo de 13.517 hectáreas durante todo el proceso de la vendimia, un trabajo que aseguran que es duro, pero gratificante. Y un trabajo que finalizará en unos meses, cuando el vino salga a la venta y llegue a nuestros paladares.

Am Montag haben sich die Ereignisse in der Russland-Affäre des Weißen Hauses überschlagen

Die 5 wichtigsten Enthüllungen im Überblick

Es war still geworden. Über Wochen hatte sich in der Russland-Affäre des Weißen Haus wenig getan.

Dann überschlugen sich am Montag die Meldungen. Bereits am Wochenende hatte sich angekündigt, dass die ersten Anklagen für ehemalige und derzeitige Wahlkampf-Helfer von US-Präsident Donald Trump an diesem Tag erfolgen würden.

► Darum geht es: Mitgliedern des Trump-Teams wird vorgeworfen, sich illegal mit Personen aus Russland während des Wahlkampfes abgesprochen zu haben, um die Wahl zu manipulieren.

► Im Zentrum der aktuellen Entwicklungen stehen drei Personen: Trumps ehemaliger Wahlkampfchef, der Unternehmer und Lobbyist Paul Manafort, dessen Geschäftspartner Rick Gates und der Ex-Berater George Papadopoulos.

Während das Weiße Haus betont, die aktuellen Vorwürfe würden sich auf die Zeit vor dem Wahlkampf beziehen - was für Manafort und Gates stimmt -, wächst der Druck auf Trump dennoch. Die Russland-Ermittlungen könnten zur Gefahr für den Präsidenten werden.

Hier ein Überblick über die Ereignisse am Montag:

1. Zwölf schwere Anklagepunkte gegen Manafort und Gates

Wichtig festzuhalten ist: Die Anklageschrift des Sonderermittlers Robert Mueller gegen Manafort und Gates hat nichts mit Donald Trump und einer möglichen Zusammenarbeit seines Wahlkampf-Teams mit Russland zu tun.

Dennoch: Die Vorwürfe gegen die beiden Geschäftsmänner sind ernst.

Ihnen wird vorgeworfen, zwischen 206 und 2015 heimlich für ausländische Regierungen gearbeitet zu haben. Manafort und Gates sollen Lobbyarbeit in den USA für die Kreml-nahe Regierung von Wiktor Janukowitsch, zwischen 2010 bis 2014 Präsident in der Ukraine, betrieben haben.

Lobbyarbeit für ausländische Regierungen muss in den USA registriert werden. Meiden Personen bewusst die Registrierung, ist das Betrug - und kann mit einer Haftstrafe geahndet werden.

Weiter wird Manafort und Gates vorgeworfen, die Bezahlung ihrer Lobbyarbeit über im Ausland tätige Banken vertuscht zu haben. Dabei soll es sich um eine Summe um über 75 Millionen Dollar handeln.

Die Anklage von Mueller zählt auch auf, wofür Manafort das Geld ausgab: ein Leben im Luxus. 934,350 Dollar soll Manafort etwa in einem Geschäft für kunstvolle Teppiche in Virgina ausgegeben haben.

Einer der zwölf Anklagepunkte lautet zudem: ""Verschwörung gegen die USA"". Das muss nicht bedeuten, dass sich Manafort mit einer ausländischen Regierung verschworen hat. Vielmehr bedeute dieser Punkt, dass Manaforts und Gates Vergehen über herkömmliche Verbrechen hinausgingen, die gegen die US-Regierung gerichtet sind, erklärt das US-Politikwebseite ""Vox"".

Die Anklageschrift hat zunächst also wenig mit Donald Trump persönlich zu tun - sie wirft dennoch ein äußerst zweifelhaftes Licht auf sein Wahlkampf-Team.

2. Die dubiosen Personen in Trumps Umfeld

Denn mit der veröffentlichten Anklageschrift vom Montag wird deutlich, mit welch zwielichtigen Personen sich der Wahlkämpfer Trump umgab. Die Anklagepunkte zeichnen von Manafort das Bild eines korrupten Geschäftsmanns, der seit vielen Jahren russische Interesse vertritt.

Hinzukommt, dass Manafort zwischen März bis August 2016 als Wahlkampfleiter eine zentrale Rolle in der Kampagne von Donald Trump einnahm.

Da stellt sich die Frage: Was wusste Trump über Manaforts Vergangenheit? Der US-Sender CNN stellt zwei Thesen auf - und beide lassen Trump nicht gut aussehen:

► Trump wusste von Manaforts dubiosen Geschäften - und es war ihm egal.

► Oder er wusste nichts von dessen Vergangenheit, die laut CNN ein offenes Geheimnis ein Washington gewesen sei - und gab ihm trotzdem einen zentralen Posten in seinem Wahlkampf-Team.

Als Mitte August 2016 bekannt wurde, dass Manafort 12,7 Millionen Dollar auf illegalem Weg von Janukowitsch erhalten hatte, trat er als Wahlkampfleiter zurück.

Gates war noch länger Teil von Trumps Umfeld und soll weiterhin auch das Weiße Haus besucht haben.

Beide, Manafort und Gates, plädierten am Montag auf nicht schuldig. Ein Gericht ordnete am Montag Hausarrest für Manafort an.

Ein anderer Wahlkämpfer von Trump bekannte sich stattdessen schuldig.

3. Berater Papadopoulos bekennt sich zu Falschaussage

Wahlkampfberater George Papadopoulos hatte gegenüber dem FBI zugegeben, eine Falschaussage gemacht zu haben. Das wurde ebenfalls am Montag bekannt.

Papadopoulos hatte beim FBI falsche Angaben über den Zeitpunkt seines Kontaktes mit einem ausländischen Professor gemacht.

Aus Papadopoulos Schuldbekenntnis geht hervor, dass der Professor den Berater erst kontaktierte, nachdem Papadopoulos Teil des Trump-Teams war. Der Professor versprach demnach, ""Schmutz"" aus Russland gegen Trumps Rivalin Hillary Clinton liefern zu können.

Das Team von Donald Trump betont, dass Papadopoulos nur eine kleine Beraterrolle innegehabt habe.

Dennoch zeigt die Enthüllung vom Monta: Teile des Trump-Teams versuchten, schädliche Informationen gegen Clinton zu sammeln. Auch Trumps Sohn Donald Trump Jr. traf sich mit einer russischen Anwältin, nachdem ihm solche Informationen versprochen worden waren.

Und so könnte die Enthüllung über Papadopoulus noch zu einem ""größeren Problem für Trump als Manaforts Anklage"" werden, kommentiert der US-Sender CNN.

4. Wird sich Manafort gegen Trump wenden?

Wie gefährlich sind die aktuellen Entwicklungen für Trump selbst? Zunächst dürften die Ereignisse vom Montag keine unmittelbaren Auswirkungen auf den US-Präsidenten haben.

Allerdings besteht die Möglichkeit, dass sich Manafort gegen Trump wendet - um Schaden von sich abzuwenden. Das vermutet etwa der US-Rechtsexperte und ehemalige Bundesstaatsanwalt Renato Mariotti.

This is consistent with an early indictment to get Manafort to flip. https://t.co/GkyIb53UZ7 — Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) 30. Oktober 2017

Auch über Papadopoulos vermuten US-Medien, dass er bereits mit Sonderermittler Mueller zusammenarbeitet.

5. Mueller stochert tief

Und so bleibt die Gefahr, dass Trump womöglich über die Russland-Affäre stolpert. Die 31-seitige Anklageschrift gegen Manafort zeigt, wie gründlich Sonderermittler Mueller in der Sache vorgeht.

Der ehemalige FBI-Direktor hat dutzende Dokumente aus dem Weißen Haus und auch Finanzdokumente von Trump selbst angefordert.

Auch enge Trump-Vertraute stehen im Verdacht, ihre Fühler nach Russland ausgestreckt zu haben. Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner und Sohn Donald Jr. gerieten in die Schlagzeilen, nachdem bekannt geworden war, dass sie sich im Wahlkampf mit einer russischen Anwältin getroffen hatten - in der Hoffnung, belastende Informationen über Clinton zu erhalten.

Dieser Montag bedeutet einen großen Fortschritt in der Ermittlung von Mueller - der Tag macht aber auch deutlich, dass die Untersuchung noch lange nicht zu Ende ist. Die Russland-Affäre dürfte Trumps Präsidentschafts weiter überschatten.

Gefährlich wird es für Trump, wenn er versucht, den Schatten des Ermittlers loszuwerden. Sollte der Präsident Sonderermittler Mueller entlassen, könnte das als Behinderung der Justiz gewertet werden - und womöglich in einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren vor dem US-Kongress enden.

Andrés Manuel López Obrador, líder nacional de Morena, aseguró que buscará a Ricardo Monreal para que ""no se vaya con la mafia del poder"".

Ese fue el mensaje que dio a conocer el tabasqueño a través de sus redes sociales.

""Claudia Sheinbaum es la coordinadora de Organización en la Ciudad de México, una mujer inteligente, honesta y de convicciones, pero voy a buscar a Ricardo Monreal para que siga con nosotros y no se vaya con los de la mafia del poder. Necesitamos de su apoyo en el movimiento de la transformación de México"", dijo López Obrador.

El mensaje se da apenas unos días después de que se filtrara en medios y redes la Encuesta a la Jefatura de Gobierno de la Ciudad de México realizada por la Presidencia de la República, en la cual se señala que Monreal sigue arriba de las preferencias electorales y que podría ganar la elección por la capital del país si se lanzara por el Frente Ciudadano conformado por PAN-PRD-MC.

En este sentido, la encuesta muestra a Monreal por encima de quien todavía figura como la virtual candidata de Morena a la jefatura de Gobierno de la Ciudad de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, con una diferencia de 1.29 puntos porcentuales.

En entrevistas reicentes, Monreal afirmó que su relación con Morena quedó entre los escombros tras el revés que sufrió en el proceso para elegir al candidato morenista a la Ciudad de México, tal como declaró en entrevista con Carlos Marín.

Pero fue en una entrevista con El Financiero, donde Monreal señaló que no se lanzaría como candidato independiente por la Ciudad de México, si no iba respaldado por el Frente Ciudadano, e incluso abrió la posibilidad a formar una coalIción con el PRI para derrotar a Morena en la capital.

""La ciudad necesita de todos, incluido el PRI. Lo que la ciudad necesita es un gobierno de coalición, un gobierno más incluyente, más abierto, más plural"", dijo Monreal en una entrevista reciente con El Financiero.

En el mismo sentido había hablado con el HuffPost cuando dijo que tres partidos políticos lo habían invitado a contender al gobierno de CDMX e incluso, dijo entonces, ser el candidato ciudadano ""de un frente de partidos para intentar tener el primer gobierno de coalición"" en la ciudad.

Desde la determinación de la ""nomenklatura"" de Morena para definir a su abanderado en la Ciudad de México, Monreal había solicitado reestablecer el procedimiento.

""Hay quienes ocupan cargos y se echan a perder, dicen que cuando no se tiene ideales, cuando no se tiene principios, el poder atonta a los inteligentes y a los tontos, no voy a decir otra cosa, los vuelve locos"", dijo Andrés Manuel López Obrador a finales de agosto.

""Este partido no es de quítate tú para quedarme yo... los cargos son sólo un medio, no son un fin"", fue la respuesta que había dado López Obrador a los reclamos de Monreal durante la Firma del Acuerdo de Unidad, en el Monumento a la Revolución al que llegaron alrededor de 20 mil personas.

Morena había ofrecido a Monreal la posibilidad de convertirse en senador o en secretario de Gobernación en caso de que López Obrador ganara la presidencia, cargos que el zacatecano había rechazado, tras aclarar que su único objetivo era convertirse en jefe de Gobierno de la Ciudad de México.

Le corps s'affole un peu (le ventre, la chaleur, le cœur) et on ne peut rien faire car ce n'est pas encore le moment.
Le trac est en grande partie lié à la nouveauté d'une situation difficile et à un manque de confiance dans ses capacités à la gérer.
Donc au moins 80 % de votre concentration doit porter sur votre discours ou votre action.
En vous exerçant régulièrement et en suivant ces conseils, votre trac devrait vite diminuer et quasiment disparaître.","""Je n'ai rien contre les psys, et pour cause! écrit notre auteur, professeur de psychiatrie, en préambule de son livre ""Vous êtes votre meilleur psy!"" (Editions Flammarion). Il a rassemblé dans cet ouvrage des principes dont l'efficacité est scientifiquement reconnue et que l'on peut appliquer par soi-même pour surmonter certaines difficultés. L'extrait que nous publions ci-dessous porte sur le trac en public.

À une jeune comédienne qui se vantait de ne pas avoir le trac avant de monter en scène, Sarah Bernhardt répondit sèchement: ""Ça vous viendra avec le talent!"". Comme quoi cette appréhension du public est bien inhérente à notre condition humaine, et peut témoigner de véritables qualités. D'autres personnalités étaient connues pour leur crainte de la scène ou des caméras: Frédéric Chopin, Ella Fitzgerald, Jacques Brel ou, dans un autre domaine, Steve Jobs.

Avoir le trac, c'est ressentir un certain stress, ou un stress certain, avant une prestation en public. Les symptômes sont assez classiques: boule dans le ventre ou dans la gorge, légers tremblements des mains ou des jambes à cause des muscles qui se tendent, bouffées de chaleur et, toujours, les fameuses palpitations. Ces sensations, en général légères et passagères, sont plus fortes chez certaines personnes, notamment les plus émotives. Il n'existe pas d'enquête très précise sur la question, mais on estime qu'environ une personne sur deux ressent le trac régulièrement dans les situations qui s'y prêtent.

La scène du crime

Qu'appelle-t-on ""prestation en public""? Évidemment, on pense tout de suite à une assemblée de 3000 personnes, devant laquelle il faudrait prendre la parole... Une épreuve, voire un cauchemar, pour la plupart d'entre nous. Mais, avouons-le, ça n'est pas une situation très courante. On peut ressentir pourtant le même type de symptômes devant un groupe d'une vingtaine ou d'une trentaine de personnes: une classe d'école, une assemblée générale de copropriétaires ou d'association, une réunion professionnelle ou un petit public de théâtre ou de conservatoire.

L'éducation française donne peu l'habitude aux enfants et aux adolescents de parler en public. Les éléments déclencheurs du trac sont principalement le fait de se trouver au centre de l'attention d'un groupe, avec une tâche particulière et pas forcément facile à réaliser, comme un discours, un exercice, un morceau de musique, etc.

Même si ça n'est pas le cas, cette configuration est alors vécue comme une situation d'examen au cours de laquelle le public devient un groupe de juges. S'entrechoquent ainsi deux anticipations négatives: peur de mal faire et peur d'un jugement négatif de l'auditoire. L'appréhension est majorée par le fait que, dans ce type de situation formelle, la communication est unidirectionnelle: vous devez faire votre prestation, tandis que le public ne fait que vous regarder, sans échange et donc sans partage des efforts ni témoignage d'approbation (avant les applaudissements du moins!).

Ces craintes ne sont pas toujours consciemment présentes, et souvent les symptômes physiques du trac surviennent de manière automatique, échappant à toute tentative de raisonnement, comme tous les symptômes de stress.

Le pire, c'est avant!

Le trac s'exprime surtout avant le début de la prestation, dans les minutes ou les heures qui le précèdent. Tout se passe généralement beaucoup mieux si on vous donne la parole tout de suite, sans avoir eu le temps de ""cogiter"". En revanche, vous vous souvenez peut-être de l'attente dans le couloir avant de passer votre premier oral du bac, en voyant défiler les camarades qui passaient avant vous, et sortaient de la salle d'examen en affichant une mine variable.

Les sensations sont les mêmes lors d'un tour de table au cours d'une réunion, ou dans l'heure précédant l'entrée en scène pour une représentation de théâtre ou de musique. Le corps s'affole un peu (le ventre, la chaleur, le cœur) et on ne peut rien faire car ce n'est pas encore le moment. Beaucoup de questions tournent alors en boucle dans la tête: ""Vais-je être à la hauteur?"", ""Comment sera le public?"", ""Pourvu que je n'aie pas un trou de mémoire!"", etc. Sans réponse bien sûr puisqu'on n'y est pas encore.

Typiquement, le niveau de trac augmente progressivement jusqu'à atteindre son maximum lors du début de la prestation. Cela peut durer encore quelques minutes, mais rapidement les choses se calment: d'une part l'esprit est concentré sur le travail à réaliser et le corps joue le rôle prévu, donc il ne reste plus beaucoup d'attention à consacrer à autre chose, et d'autre part les questions sans réponses jusqu'à présent s'éteignent d'elles-mêmes. À moins d'une catastrophe, le fait de constater que vous vous en sortez correctement, qu'aucun spectateur ne se lève en vous jetant des tomates (ce qui devient rare de nos jours...), et que vous maîtrisez donc la situation, permet de désamorcer le trac.

Une certaine tension peut durer pendant toute la ""séance"", témoin d'une vigilance accrue et d'une motivation à bien faire, mais elle n'est en général ni gênante ni vraiment pénible. Et elle se transforme en soulagement, voire en vraie euphorie, quand l'exercice se termine. Ouf, ça n'était que cela! Mais dommage de devoir passer par ce couloir sombre du trac avant de voir la lumière de la réussite...

Les dix commandements anti-trac

Voici dix conseils à suivre pour que ce tunnel devienne de moins en moins long et pénible au fur et à mesure.

1. Déculpabilisez

Chassez de votre esprit l'idée que le trac est un signe de faiblesse ou d'incompétence. Plus de la moitié des adultes se plaignent de ressentir un trac excessif avant une prestation en public, vous n'êtes donc pas seul, et personne ne vous considérera comme un extraterrestre si on vous sent un peu ému dans ce type de situation. Le trac est avant tout un signe de motivation, d'envie de bien faire et une marque de respect pour l'auditoire. Rien de pire qu'un étudiant qui vient passer un examen oral les mains dans les poches, sans aucune attention portée à sa présentation et à l'attitude des examinateurs.

2. Évitez de surestimer les enjeux de la situation

En dehors de moments exceptionnels (oral décisif dans un concours, entretien d'embauche pour un poste important, etc.) pour lesquels on est généralement très entraîné, la plupart des réactions de trac surviennent dans des situations qui ne sont pas gravement déterminantes. Même si vous être très motivé par le but à atteindre, essayez de répondre objectivement aux questions suivantes: si je ne suis pas parfait, est-ce si important? Même si je rate cette fois-ci, est-ce vraiment ma dernière chance? Que se passerait-il réellement si tout ne marchait pas comme je le souhaite? Pensez à ce que vous diriez à votre meilleur ami dans la même situation. Vous verrez vite qu'il est possible de relativiser, pour éviter de vous mettre une pression digne de celle d'un tireur de penalty en finale de la coupe du monde...

3. Préparez correctement vos interventions

Cela peut paraître une évidence mais autant le rappeler malgré tout. Le trac est en grande partie lié à la nouveauté d'une situation difficile et à un manque de confiance dans ses capacités à la gérer. Le seul moyen de réduire ces deux facteurs est de bien maîtriser son sujet: réviser, relire, approfondir, etc. Et, surtout, s'entraîner à le présenter, soit seul soit avec des spectateurs bienveillants. Plus vous aurez automatisé certaines aptitudes, plus vous aurez confiance en vous, et plus votre esprit pourra se concentrer sur les points sensibles lors de la situation réelle. Donc, répétez, répétez et répétez encore, sans honte car même les professionnels travaillent ainsi, en s'aidant si besoin d'enregistrements audio ou vidéo.

S'il s'agit d'un discours ou d'une intervention orale, même si vous ne préférez pas apprendre l'ensemble de votre texte par cœur, mémorisez malgré tout quelques passages clés, comme la première phrase, la dernière et quelques articulations importantes. Vous ne les restituerez pas forcément de manière exacte, mais vous serez rassuré par ce filet de sécurité pour les phases essentielles de votre présentation ; ce sont celles que le public retiendra d'ailleurs en priorité.

4. Apprenez à utiliser votre respiration comme un calmant naturel

L'avantage de cet anxiolytique est qu'on peut l'avoir toujours sur soi! Et, ce qui ne gâche rien, il n'a aucun effet secondaire.

L'objectif est de vous concentrer durant deux minutes sur votre respiration, en essayant de la rendre lente et plutôt contrôlée par le ""ventre"" (les muscles de l'abdomen agissent directement sur le diaphragme et donc les poumons). Inspirez lentement, pas trop profondément, puis prenez bien conscience de l'expiration, en soufflant lentement par le nez ou par la bouche peu ouverte. À chaque expiration, percevez le relâchement des muscles du corps qui l'accompagne. Positionnez une main sur votre ventre pour bien sentir les mouvements de l'abdomen, et les amplifier si besoin. En vous entraînant régulièrement à froid à ce petit exercice, vous pourrez l'appliquer facilement à chaud, notamment dans les phases de préparation et d'attente avant la prise de parole.

5. Visualisez la scène mentalement avant qu'elle ne commence

Concentrez-vous uniquement sur vos propres actions: je dis ceci, je prends cela, je fais ça, je parle à untel, etc. À la manière d'un skieur qui visualise sa descente et chacun des virages les yeux fermés avant de se lancer sur la piste. Cette répétition virtuelle vous rassurera sur votre connaissance du sujet, et vous évitera les pensées parasites stressantes.

6. ""Forcez le passage"" avec des images positives

Durant l'attente, vous pouvez visualiser un souvenir précis de réussite dans un exercice similaire antérieur, ou les encouragements ou compliments de vos amis. Il ne s'agit pas là de vous convaincre que vous êtes le (ou la) meilleur(e), mais simplement d'occuper le terrain pour chasser la propagande négative de votre anxiété. Comme sur un ordinateur, il n'y a de la place que pour un seul ""fond d'écran"" dans votre esprit, donc faites en sorte qu'il vous soit favorable. Utilisez les minutes d'attente pour vous créer une image mentale favorable, par exemple en visualisant vos proches vous encourageant et affirmant qu'ils adorent ce que vous faites. Quitte à forcer le trait, il vaut mieux que vous commenciez votre intervention dans un climat intérieur optimiste plutôt que pessimiste.

7. Pendant votre intervention, concentrez-vous sur le contenu de votre action

C'est la condition essentielle de la réussite, puisque votre auditoire s'intéresse avant tout à ce que vous avez à lui dire ou à lui montrer. Donc au moins 80 % de votre concentration doit porter sur votre discours ou votre action. Il vous faut réserver 10 à 20 % de votre attention sur deux autres points: votre expression non verbale (votre position, regarder le public, sourire, parler fort et distinctement, etc.) et l'attitude du public (repérer par exemple une incompréhension manifeste ou une demande particulière).

Cette tâche supplémentaire est difficile, car on ne passe pas aisément d'une cible à l'autre sans perdre le fil de ses actions, mais j'insiste sur le fait que la priorité reste le contenu de votre prestation. Entre chaque paragraphe ou entre chaque séquence de votre intervention, vous pouvez donc faire un bref focus, de quelques secondes, sur votre manière de parler ou de sourire, et sur le public. Mais ne placez pas la barre trop haute sur ces points qui ne sont pas les plus importants. Ils participent à la qualité globale de votre prestation mais de manière partielle, et ils s'amélioreront mécaniquement avec l'entraînement et l'habitude.

8. Choisissez dès le début quelles personnes vous allez principalement regarder

Dans une grande assemblée, il est important de regarder souvent le public, mais il n'est pas indispensable ni facile de regarder chaque personne avec la même intensité. Choisissez donc quelques visages qui vous paraissent sympathiques, parce que vous les connaissez ou parce qu'ils semblent souriants et bienveillants, et tournez-vous vers eux à tour de rôle (sans les fixer en permanence bien sûr). Essayez aussi de balayer régulièrement les différentes parties du public, afin que personne ne se sente exclu de votre intérêt et finisse par ne plus vous suivre. Pour cela, sélectionnez des visages ""cibles"" relativement dispersés dans l'assemblée, ou au moins regardez vers le fond de la salle si vous avez du mal à repérer les personnes directement.

9. Si la situation s'y prête, n'hésitez pas à dire quelques mots sur votre trac en début de prestation

C'est le meilleur moyen de dédramatiser ce sujet probablement un peu tabou pour vous, voire d'en sourire. En effet, vous n'aurez ainsi plus besoin de le dissimuler au public, puisqu'il sera déjà au courant! Et personne ne vous en voudra d'être un peu stressé lors d'un exercice de ce type. Vous pouvez préparer des formules comme ""Je suis toujours un peu stressé quand je dois monter en scène!"", ou encore ""Vous m'impressionnez beaucoup, je suis très ému de vous parler, n'y prêtez pas attention...""

10. Évitez l'autodénigrement à la fin de l'intervention ou après

Après un exercice relativement difficile, vous risquez toujours de vous trouver médiocre ou moyen. Mais ce jugement négatif ne fera que vous déstabiliser pour la fois suivante, et vous aurez déployé beaucoup d'efforts pour rien. Pour faire baisser votre trac, repérez objectivement et gardez en mémoire après chaque prestation les éléments qui se sont bien passés, il y en a forcément.

Osez!

En vous exerçant régulièrement et en suivant ces conseils, votre trac devrait vite diminuer et quasiment disparaître. Pour ne pas perdre la main, prenez le parti de vous exposer au public le plus souvent possible, en osant surmonter votre petite inhibition initiale. Vous verrez, vous y trouverez probablement du plaisir.

Si vous ne parvenez pas à appliquer ces conseils dans les situations naturelles de votre vie, vous pouvez choisir de créer des conditions plus favorables et plus régulières. Il peut s'agir de vous inscrire à des cours de théâtre ou à une autre activité artistique, ce qui vous permettra de vous entraîner devant de petits publics initialement sans pression particulière puisque dans le cadre d'un apprentissage. Les cours de chant et les chorales sont également d'excellents moyens de combiner une activité plaisante et épanouissante, la rencontre d'autres personnes, et l'expression de soi, facilitée par le fait au début de ne pas être ""seul en scène"". Il existe aussi des cours spécifiques de prise de parole en public, avec un coaching et une entreaide très utiles entre les participants.

Enfin, si le blocage est plus sérieux et que votre peur de la scène ou du public est trop forte et vous empêche de vous épanouir, c'est peut-être que vous souffrez d'une anxiété sociale excessive. Il s'agit d'une angoisse phobique qui ne permet pas d'appliquer complètement les conseils des dix commandements anti-tracs, ou qui les rend inefficaces car le stress est trop intense et occupe trop de place dans l'esprit. La phobie sociale est un trouble fréquent, qui touche près de 5 % de la population, et qui apparaît généralement dans l'enfance ou l'adolescence. Elle peut s'atténuer progressivement, mais son impact sur la qualité de vie et sur les activités personnelles et professionnelles est important. Il est donc préférable de se faire aider par un professionnel pour en venir à bout, d'autant que les méthodes des thérapies comportementales et cognitives sont très efficaces pour cela.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Sunday that India could not lag behind in the ""digital currency era"", as he took a dig at ""stalwarts"" who had mocked his government's push for digital transactions.

""Now an era of digital currency has started, and India should not lag behind,"" Modi said at a rally in Ujire (Karnataka), about 50km from Mangaluru in the coastal district of Dakshina Kannada.

He said digitisation was aimed at bringing in accountability and added that more cash would bring with it social evils.

The prime minister also hit out at people who saw themselves as ""Tees Maar Khan"" -- a colloquial phrase used for those who pretend to be smart or heroic -- and had been sceptical of digital transactions.

""Last November, December and January, stalwarts made speeches in Parliament. If you haven't heard them, hear them. These stalwarts who see themselves as ""Tees Maar Khan"", those who think themselves as the epitome of knowledge, used to say that in India there is poverty, lack of education, how can digital transaction work,"" Modi said.

They also wondered how people could go cashless, he said.

""They spared no effort to speak ill about digital transactions,"" he said at a rally of the Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project, where he symbolically presented a beneficiary with a RuPay card, an Indian version of a credit or debit card.

Under the project, run by the organisation managed by the Dharmadhikari (hereditary administrator) of Dharmastala, Veerendra Heggade, about 12 lakh Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana account holders would benefit from the RuPay card.

""Our mothers and sisters who live in villages, whether they are educated or not, have taken a pledge. Twelve lakh people have taken a pledge that they will transact their self-help group related business cashless; they will go with digital transaction, with RuPay card,"" Modi said.

Complimenting Heggade for his efforts, Modi said he worked towards ensuring digital India.

Noting that the times had changed, Modi said currencies had been changing with time, too.

""At one point of time it used to be stone. Then came leather, then gold and silver, ornaments, paper and plastic. It has been changing from time to time. Now an era of digital currency has started and India should not lag behind,"" he said.

The Prime Minister also spoke of the government's efforts at ensuring that every rupee from the Centre was used for the welfare of Indians and that it reached the intended beneficiary without any scope for leakage.

""One of our former Prime Ministers had said if one rupee goes from Delhi, by the time it reaches a village it will become 15 paise. Who are these people who do this,"" he asked.

Highlighting the direct benefit transfer scheme, Modi said because of the government's efforts, Rs 57,000 crore ""going into someone's hand illegally"" had been stopped and the money was now reaching the right beneficiary.

""Now tell me, those people whose pocket the Rs 57,000 crore used to go to, will they like Modi? Will they not get angry with Modi?... Difficulties will come, but standing at this holy place I'm saying whether we are there or not, we will not let this country be destroyed,"" he said.

Speaking on skill development, Modi said, ""In this 21st century, developed counties of the world are also discussing skill development. It is regarded as a prime sector.""

Pointing out that India took pride for its demographic dividend of having 800 million people, or 65 per cent of its population, below the age of 35, he said skill development should not only be used for meeting basic needs such as food but also for ensuring that the dreams of the country were fulfilled.

Former governor-general Sir Ninian Stephen will be honoured with a state funeral following his death at the age of 94.

Government House on Sunday announced Sir Ninian, who was Australia's governor-general from 1982 to 1989, had died in Melbourne.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull paid tribute to the ""great statesman"", and said ""there are very few honours that Sir Ninian doesn't have to his name"".

""He's been knighted five times, was a Justice of the High Court of Australia and Supreme Court of Victoria, member of the Privy Council and Australian Ambassador for the Environment,"" he said in a statement.

""Australia will remember Sir Ninian for his humility, his intellect, and his lifelong commitment to justice and the rule of law.

""Sir Ninian's family has accepted my offer of a state funeral.""

Australia's only immigrant Governor-General was born in Britain and arrived in Melbourne in 1940 aged 17. He studied to become a lawyer before joining the Australian Imperial Force.

After the war, Sir Ninian returned to law, becoming a QC in 1966 and a Victorian Supreme Court judge four years later.

He went onto the High Court before being chosen by Malcolm Fraser to replace Zelman Cowen as governor-general in 1982.

Soon after stepping down in 1989, Sir Ninian was appointed Australia's first ambassador to the environment under Bob Hawke.

In 1992, the British and Irish governments chose Sir Ninian to head a new round of peace talks in Northern Ireland.

He later became a judge on the international tribunal to try war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.

Approaching his 80s, Sir Ninian remained in demand, advising on South Africa's constitution and helping negotiate a way through a political impasse in Bangladesh.

He was also part of an investigation in Burma on behalf of the International Labor Organisation, and helped set up a tribunal to hear Cambodian atrocities and draft a constitution for post-Taliban Afghanistan.

Over the last month I’ve been working closely with the Macmillan social media team and online support team.
In October, there’s been a focus on breast cancer as it’s breast cancer awareness month, so I’ve done three live Q&A sessions on social media where people asked questions about breast cancer and I answered them.
For example, when I was a clinical nurse (I was a breast cancer specialist nurse for many years), I was aware that people were going to the internet after I spoke to them.
Alternatively, people can phone us or they can ask a nurse on the online community or through Facebook.","In light of this we spoke to Ellen, who has more than 30 years of experience in oncology nursing, about what to expect from her new role and why it’s much-needed.

Her role was created after Macmillan noticed cancer patients were coming away from appointments without the information they needed and were turning to unverified internet sites which left them ‘needlessly frightened’ and at risk of ‘bogus cures’.

Ellen said the information, which was so readily available online, had not only impacted him financially but also psychologically. “He worried that he’d done more harm than good,” she explained.

Macmillan Cancer Support’s new digital nurse specialist Ellen McPake revealed to HuffPost UK that one man flew his sick wife abroad and paid thousands of pounds for a coffee enema treatment (where coffee is injected directly into the colon), which never worked. The man’s wife later died, leaving him distraught.

Why is the role important?

It’s a way of reaching lots of different people, more and more so in the digital era. There are a lot of people posting from their smartphones or computers and asking lots of questions, so it’s about having the facility to be there to answer those questions through a digital platform because some people aren’t comfortable picking up the phone.

What are the most common misconceptions around cancer?

There are quite a lot. For example, you can go onto the internet and put ‘cure for cancer’ and you’ll get results like ‘sodium bicarbonate cures breast cancer’ or ‘chemotherapy kills more people than it cures’. These aren’t verified sites and there is no evidence behind these statements.

One of the other common misconceptions is taking superfoods to cure cancer or coffee enemas. Some people travel to different countries to have coffee enemas and spend thousands of pounds on something that’s not evidence-based.

What’s the most dangerous and misleading information you’ve seen about cancer?

When I worked on the support line, I received a call from a man whose wife had died from cancer. He had read online that she could go to a clinic and get a coffee enema. His wife unfortunately passed away and he phoned the helpline one night because he was distraught that he had believed what he read.

He had gone away with his wife and spent thousands of pounds on this treatment, and at the end of the call he said he wished he had just spent the money on her bucket list instead. He said he felt he couldn’t go to his GP for support because he thought the GP would think he was silly.

He also worried that he’d done more harm than good to his wife. Psychologically that’s a big impact for a person, as well as financially.

Being diagnosed with cancer can be stressful and such a minefield - you get lots of conflicting information - but we want to provide trusted, reliable information so you can contact our nurses and be signposted to the right places.

When do you start?

I officially started at the end of August, but so far it’s just been an induction period. I’m now fully in the role. Over the last month I’ve been working closely with the Macmillan social media team and online support team. The benefits of this role, or the difference in this role, is that there’s a nurse from the nursing team working with the social media team and the Macmillan online community team - so it’s three teams working together to try and reach as many people who are affected by cancer.

What will the role involve?

I work solely online, teaming up with radiographers, dieticians and other healthcare professionals to coordinate answers to the questions that are sent to me (either through social media or the charity’s online community).

In October, there’s been a focus on breast cancer as it’s breast cancer awareness month, so I’ve done three live Q&A sessions on social media where people asked questions about breast cancer and I answered them. Next month the focus will turn to head and neck cancer, and pancreatic cancer.

There are over 30 nurses on the phone support line, who also do some online work, but I’m the only person who specialises in online support.

What are your main concerns about fake cancer news?

The biggest concern is that people believe what they read about cures and treatment online - and that it can do more harm than good.

For example, if you read that sodium bicarbonate can cure breast cancer and then you drink it, it might be harmful when taken in conjunction with any other medicines you might be taking. It’s also not taking into account how your kidneys or liver is functioning. It can be very harmful.

Where can people find trusted information?

The NHS Choices website, Macmillan and, of course, other dedicated cancer charities.

What should people do if they are diagnosed and come away from the consultation confused?

I think health professionals have a major role to play. For example, when I was a clinical nurse (I was a breast cancer specialist nurse for many years), I was aware that people were going to the internet after I spoke to them. As a health professional, I’d acknowledge that people were probably going to do that so I would signpost them to specific websites with trusted information.

The moment someone is diagnosed with cancer, their mind goes blank and they go away and speak to their family and friends, and everybody starts looking at the internet, where they then find conflicting information. If you do find conflicting information, we would always advise people to phone the specialist nurse who is looking after them and ask more questions. Alternatively, people can phone us or they can ask a nurse on the online community or through Facebook. We will always go through this information with people to break it down for them, but most importantly we would suggest questions that they might want to ask the doctor during their next visit so they’re better informed.",Macmillan's 'Fake News' Nurse Shares Heartbreaking Story About How Online Misinformation Can Ruin Lives,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/macmillan-fake-news-nurse-shares-heartbreaking-story-about-how-online-misinformation-can-ruin-lives_uk_59f740a5e4b03cd20b83217f

Die Berge an Plastikmüll auf der Welt werden immer größer und belasten Mensch und Umwelt

Doch können wir auf Plastik verzichten?

Eine HuffPost-Redakteurin hat es ausprobiert - und ist gescheitert

Plastik ist überall. Die Welt versinkt im Müll. Tagtäglich erreichen uns neue Horrormeldungen. Aber nur selten denken wir über die Folgen der Plastik-Schwemme nach. Das wollen wir ändern. Was würde es bedeuten, auf Plastik zu verzichten? HuffPost-Redakteurin Uschi Jonas hat es ausprobiert und dabei gemerkt, vor welch gigantischen Problemen unsere Gesellschaft in den nächsten Jahren steht.

Seit Wochen habe ich mich auf meinen Sizilien-Urlaub gefreut. Doch als ich endlich in Catania ankomme, lande ich wenig später in der hässlichen Realität.

Ich fahre mit dem Mietwagen die Autostrada auf die Stadt zu, die Sonne strahlt, das Meerwasser glitzert, Oleander und Magnolien säumen den Straßenrand.

Und dann sehe ich sie: die Berge an Plastikmüll am Straßenrand. Zerdrückte Joghurtbecher, Einkaufstüten, die im Wind flattern, schmutzige Plastikflaschen, zerfledderte Eisverpackungen.

Schon länger denke ich über solche wachsenden Müllberge nach. Die vollen Säcke, die ich Zuhause alle paar Tage in den Hof schleppe.

Manchmal habe ich das Gefühl, dass unsere Welt in Plastik versinkt - und selten zuvor ist es mir das so klar geworden wie hier in Catania.

Am Straßenrand stapelt sich der Abfall, am Strand verheddern sich Plastikreste an meinen Füßen, im Meer klebt plötzlich ein Stück Folie an meinen Körper. Mal ist der Müll groß, mal klein, mal durchsichtig.

Plastik ist allgegenwärtig. Morgens der Kaffeebecher, mittags das eingepackte Brötchen - und sogar die Zahnpasta enthält winzige Plastikpartikel.

9,6 Millionen Tonnen Plastik verbrauchen wir in Deutschland jedes Jahr

Was würde es bedeuten, auf Plastik zu verzichten? Irgendwo zwischen Sizilien und meiner Heimat München habe ich entschieden, genau das auszuprobieren.

Seitdem habe ich nicht nur viel über mich gelernt, sondern auch verstanden, vor welch gigantischen Problemen unsere Gesellschaft in den nächsten Jahren steht, wenn wir das Plastik-Problem ernsthaft angehen wollen.

Am ersten Tag meines Selbstversuchs habe ich überlegt, wo ich im Alltag das meiste Plastik erlebe. Und schnell war mir klar: im Supermarkt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: So will ein Supermarktbesitzer in seinen Edeka-Filialen künftig Plastikmüll vermeiden



Jedes Mal, wenn ich durch die Obst-Theke bei Rewe, Edeka oder Lidl laufe, frage ich mich, warum müssen zwei Paprika in einer Plastikschale liegen, die dann auch noch von einer Plastiktüte eingeschweißt ist - am besten noch mit Bio-Label drauf?

Aber wie viel Plastikmüll produziere ich eigentlich? Ich lande auf der Website der Verbraucherzentrale.



9,6 Millionen Tonnen Plastik verbrauchen wir in Deutschland jedes Jahr. Das sind rund 130 Kilo pro Kopf.

Weltweit ist der Kunststoffverbrauch in den letzten Jahrzehnten massiv angestiegen. Waren es in den 1950er Jahren noch 1,7 Millionen Tonnen, hat sich das Ganze bis 1989 nahezu um das Hundertfache gesteigert. Im Jahr 2012 waren es schon 288 Millionen Tonnen.

Und die Müll-Mengen lassen sich nicht biologisch abbauen. Ein Joghurtbecher beispielsweise braucht 500 Jahre um sich zu zersetzen.

”Man merkt schnell, dass man vieles gar nicht braucht”, sagt Hannah Sartin vom “Ohne”-Laden

Also was tun? Immer mal wieder hab ich von verpackungsfreien Supermärkte gehört. Die gibt es in vielen deutschen Großstädten. Auch in München.

Im “Ohne”-Laden in der Schellingstraße treffe ich auf Hannah Sartin. Sie hat den Laden vor gut anderthalb Jahren gemeinsam mit ihrem Mann eröffnet.

“Fast jeden Tag kommt jemand zu uns in den Laden, der noch nie da war”, erzählt sie. Fast sei es, wie der Beginn einer neuen Bewegung: “Man fühlt sich frei mit diesem Lebensstil, weil man sich abkoppelt von der Konsumgesellschaft und schnell merkt, dass man vieles gar nicht braucht.”

Der Laden ist kaum größer als ein Kiosk - und trotzdem ist die Auswahl groß: Obst, Gemüse, Nudeln, Reis, Bulgur, Tee, Gewürze, Soßen, Marmeladen, Joghurt, Käse. Was nicht in Glas verpackt ist, ist unverpackt und kann selbst abgefüllt werden - in kleine Baumwollsäckchen, Gläser oder Metalldosen.

Am Ende kaufe ich mir eine Glasflasche, ein bisschen Obst, Couscous, Nudeln und eine Bambus-Zahnbürste. Wirklich alle Lebensmittel bekomme ich aber nicht unverpackt.

Ladenbesitzerin Hannah erzählt mir, dass sie und ihre Familie weitestgehend plastik- und müllfrei leben.

“Ich fand immer, dass die größte Einschränkung im Kopf stattfindet. Am Anfang kann man sich nicht vorstellen, wie das funktionieren soll. Beim Lebensmitteleinkauf dachte ich mir, okay es bleibt nur Obst, Gemüse und Brot übrig, was ich kaufen kann. Aber mit der Zeit haben sich in den verschiedensten Ecken der Stadt neue Möglichkeiten aufgetan, an unverpackte Dinge zu kommen, in Teeläden, Gewürzläden, auf dem Markt”, sagt sie.



Die erste Herausforderung folgt schon auf dem Weg zur Arbeit. Ich kaufe mir morgens gern Butterbrezeln beim Bäcker. Heute hab ich dann eines meiner neuen Baumwollsäckchen mitgenommen, um die Verkäuferin zu bitten, mir die Brezeln ohne Tüte zu geben, die in manchen Bäckereien auch einen Plastikanteil hat.



“Sie können mir die Brezeln direkt auf die Hand geben.”



“Was, nein wieso? Nehmen Sie doch einen Tüte.”



“Nein, nein, das passt, vielen Dank. Ich nehme sie gerne so.”



“Nein, dann bekommen Sie ja ganz buttrige Hände, ich gebe Ihnen wenigstens Servietten dazu.”



“Nein, wirklich, ich brauche nichts.”



“Haben Sie denn so großen Hunger, dass Sie die beiden Brezn gleich verputzen wollen?!”



“Nein, ich esse gleich eine und gebe die andere gleich noch einer Kollegin.”



Ich dachte ernsthaft, die Variante Ich-brauche-keine-Tüte-weil-ich-gleich-esse ist besser oder einfacher, als der Bäckersfrau einen Vortrag über Verpackungen zu halten. Aber morgen werde ich ihr das einfach erklären. Eine Person mehr auf dem Planeten, die über Müll nachdenkt.







Oft hole ich mir für die Mittagspause einen Salat bei unserem Brotzeitmann im Büro. Auch daran bin ich heute gescheitert: Plastikverpackung für den Salat, Plastikverpackung für das Dressing.



Also ab in die Kantine oder künftig selber gekochtes Essen mitbringen in meiner neuen Metalldose.

Abends schaue ich mir den Dokumentarfilm “The Plastic Planet” an. Dort zeigt der österreichische Regisseur Werner Boote die Gefahren von Plastik auf und wie die Kunststoffe immer weiter die ganze Welt verschmutzen.

80 Prozent des Mülls im Meer kommt vom Land, davon ist 75 Prozent Plastik

Ein Satz hat sich dabei besonders in meinen Kopf gebrannt: Alle Plastikteile, die bislang hergestellt wurden, sind immer noch irgendwo auf unserem Planeten. Und jedes Jahr kommen Millionen Tonnen dazu.

Und das meiste davon landet irgendwann im Meer. 75 Prozent des Mülls, der in den Ozeanen landet, ist Plastik, wie der Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) berichtet. ) Allein in Deutschland landet jede Minute eine ganze Tonne Plastik im Meer



➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich unterstütze weltweit Menschen im Kampf gegen den Plastikmüll - von Deutschland bin ich sehr enttäuscht



Laut dem Umweltprogramm der Vereinten Nationen (UNEP) treiben auf jedem Quadratkilometer Meeresoberfläche bis zu 18.000 Plastikteile unterschiedlichster Größe, der WWF spricht sogar von bis zu 46.000. Und das ist nur der sichtbare Teil des Müllbergs. Denn über 70 Prozent des Plastikmülls sinkt auf den Meeresgrund.



Und da schließt sich auch wieder der Kreis nach Catania. Ich habe dort im Gasthaus eines alten Sizilianers gewohnt, der jeden Morgen Frühstück für seine Gäste macht. Mit frisch gepresstem Orangensaft, süßem Gebäck und ganz viel klein portionierten, in Plastik verpackter Butter, Marmelade, Joghurt, Zwieback.

Komplett auf Plastik verzichten - wie soll das gehen?

Tag 2 meines Experiments. 6.50 Uhr, mein Wecker klingelt, ich greife zum Smartphone - Plastikhülle. 6.55 Uhr, ich stehe auf, gehe in die Küche, mache mir Kaffee - die Maschine ist aus Plastik. 7.00 Uhr, ich gehe ins Bad, greife zu meiner Bambus-Zahnbürste (check!), aber dann ist da die Zahnpasta… 7.25 Uhr, ich steige aufs Fahrrad, mein Lenker ist aus Plastik. 8.00 Uhr, ich komme bei der Arbeit an, öffne die Eingangstür mit meiner Zugangskarte - aus Plastik - fahre meinen Laptop hoch, nutze die Maus - Plastik.

Ich bin frustriert. Komplett auf Plastik verzichten - wie soll das gehen?

Ich stöbere durch alle meine Alltagsgegenstände: Schmuck, Taschen, Kosmetikartikel, Shampoo, Kleiderbügel, Haargummis, Rasierer, Smartphone, Stifte, Kopfhörer, EC-Karten und noch so vieles mehr. Überall ist Plastik verarbeitet.

Und während ich mir das klar mache, denke ich über die Alternativen nach: Papier zum Beispiel, Glas und Stoff. Aber sind die wirklich ökologisch sinnvoller? Wenn es keine bio-zertifizierten Produkte sind, benötigt auch die Herstellung von Stofftaschen und Papiertüten viel Wasser und Chemikalien bei der Herstellung. Umweltfreundlicher werden sie erst durch ihre Wiederverwendung.

Auch beim Plastik selbst gibt es Unterschiede. 76 Prozent des Mineralwassers, das in Deutschland getrunken wird, ist in PET-Flaschen abgefüllt. Mehrwegflaschen sind ökologisch um einiges sinnvoller. Die werden gereinigt und wiederbefüllt - und das ist umweltschonender als Einwegflaschen, die geschreddert werden.

Trotzdem bleibt Glas besser als Mehrweg. Glas wird bis zu 50 Mal neu befüllt, Mehrwegflaschen lediglich 25 Mal. Danach landen die Überreste auch irgendwann im Meer, wie NABU berichtet.

Okay, was kann ich jetzt also durch etwas anderes als Plastik ersetzen? Ich beginne damit, eine neue Smartphone-Hülle zu suchen. Und das ist gar nicht so leicht. Selbst wenn ich nach Holz im Internet suche, versteckt sich in den meisten Hüllen trotzdem irgendwie Plastik.

Wasser will ich ab sofort nur noch aus meiner Glasflasche trinken. Doch für mich als Sprudel-Fanatikerin wird das eine große Umstellung bedeuten, wenn ich nur noch Leitungswasser abfülle. Ich werde auch versuchen, die Bambus-Zahnbürste zu nutzen. Auch das ist eine Einschränkung, denn seit Jahren benutze ich eigentlich eine elektrische Zahnbürste. Die gibt es auch nicht ohne Plastik.

Ich suche nach einer plastikfreien Kaffeemaschine. Fehlanzeige. Selbst die teuersten Maschinen haben in der Regel irgendwelche Elemente aus Plastik.

Alles ist voll von Mikroplastik

Meine Herausforderung für den nächsten Tag: Ich versuche Plastik in meinem Alltag zu finden, das man gar nicht sieht. Denn ganz nebenbei, von uns unbemerkt, produzieren wir täglich noch so viel mehr Plastikmüll.

Shampoo, Seife, Zahnpasta, Gesichts-Peelings, Waschmittel, Cremes und Schminke enthalten Plastik. All diesen Produkten wird Kunststoff in flüssiger oder gelartiger Form zugesetzt und als Füllstoff und Bindemittel verwendet oder es dient als Schleifmittel zur Glättung und Reinigung von Haut und Zähnen.

Und das ist noch lange nicht alles.

Jedes Mal, wenn wir beispielsweis eine Fleecejacke in der Waschmaschine waschen, landen 114.000 bis 2.200.000 Polyesterfasern im Abwasser.

Eine Jacke, die einmal gewaschen wird. Ich wasche teilweise mehrmals die Woche. Viele Kleidungsstücke. Immer und immer wieder.

Mikroplastik ist also irgendwie überall. Nicht nur dort, wo wir Plastik sehen, sondern auch in Kosmetika, Textilien und Lebensmitteln.

Und das Problem: Die meisten Kläranlagen können es nicht herausfiltern. Lediglich eine Schlussfiltration könnte die Belastung des Gewässer reduzieren. Doch die ist teuer. Folglich landet Mikroplastik in Flüssen und letztlich im Meer.

Wir nehmen es aber nicht nur zu uns, wenn wir Fisch essen. Sondern auch über Leitungswasser oder Nahrungsmittel wie Milch oder Honig. Sie sind verunreinigt durch kleinste Plastikpartikel, die sich in der Umwelt verteilen.

Und das kann schwere gesundheitliche Folgen für uns haben. Bisphenol A, polyzyklische aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe, Phtalate - das sind alles Chemikalien, die als Weich- und Hartmacher in Plastik verwendet werden. Und die können krebserregend sein, hormonverändernd wirken, Diabetes, Herzkrankheiten und sexuelle Störungen verursachen.

Am Ende des Selbstversuchs: Ernüchterung

Ich mache mich auf die Suche nach mikroplastikfreien Kosmetika und werde im Drogeriemarkt fündig. Auf den meisten steht das explizit drauf.

Ich kaufe mir Gesichtscreme, Shampoo, Zahnpasta und Waschpulver und bin gespannt, ob ich einen Unterschied zu meinen bisherigen Lieblingsprodukten feststelle.

Die Zahnpasta ist aus Nanaminze. Klingt gut. Aber als ich sie benutze, bin ich ein wenig enttäuscht. Ich liebe es, wenn die Zahnpasta für einen richtig frischen Geschmack sorgt und sich meine Zähne total glatt anfühlen. Doch das klappt nicht mit meiner neuen Zahnpasta.

Dafür sind die Creme und das Shampoo super und auch meine frisch gewaschene Wäsche riecht gut. Teurer als die Produkte, die ich sonst benutze, sind sie dennoch.

Apropos Wäsche. Ich liebe Klamotten und ich liebe es, mir neue zu kaufen. Auch gerne online. Ich stöbere durch meine Lieblingsläden im Internet und entdecke, dass es selbst bei einigen großen Modeketten inzwischen ökologische Kleidung gibt. Ob die auch immer plastikfrei ist oder nur recycelt ist nicht immer ersichtlich. Am Ende bestelle ich mir zwei neue T-Shirts, die nicht einmal nennenswert teurer sind.

Doch als die nach ein paar Tagen bei mir ankommen ist es mir fast peinlich, das Paket zu öffnen: Denn auch mein vermeintlich nachhaltiger Einkauf kommt in Plastiktüten verpackt bei mir an.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ein Umweltaktivist erklärt, warum Plastikmüll eine größere Bedrohung als der Klimawandel ist



Am Ende meines Selbstversuch überkommt mich vor allem eines: Ernüchterung. Es kommt mir vor, als sei Plastik nicht aus meinem Alltag wegzudenken. Klar, ein paar Dinge sind Luxusprodukte, die ich eigentlich nicht brauche. Andere kann ich ersetzen. Aber komplett darauf verzichten? Unmöglich.

Viele plastikfreien Produkte sind teurer, andere bedeuten, dass ich meine Gewohnheiten einschränken muss, mehr Zeit brauche, um Dinge zu besorgen.

Ich werde es höchstwahrscheinlich nie schaffen, vollständig auf Plastik zu verzichten. Aber ich will und kann Schritt für Schritt Dinge in meinem Alltag verändern.

Ich möchte aufhören, online Kleidung zu shoppen, die immer in Plastiktüten verpackt wird und einen hohen Polyester-Anteil hat. Mein Obst und Gemüse kaufe ich ab jetzt auf dem Wochenmarkt oder in einem verpackungsfreien Supermarkt und überlege mir bei allem, was ich kaufe, ob ich das jetzt wirklich brauche und ob es eine umweltschonende Alternative gibt.

Eine Welt ohne Plastik wird es leider nicht mehr geben. Aber wir müssen unseren Konsum überdenken.

Und wenn wir alle einen kleinen Schritt gehen, wird daraus ein großer.

NEW DELHI -- The Supreme Court on Monday said a five-judge constitution bench will hear a batch of petitions challenging the validity of the Aadhaar law on charges of being intrusive and violating the right to privacy.

An apex court bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice A.M. Khanwilkar and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said the hearing will take place in the last week of November.

The court said this after Attorney General K.K. Venugopal told the bench that the Centre had filed a detailed affidavit refuting all the allegations on expanding the area under Aadhaar linkage.

Asking the court not to issue any further interim orders, Venugopal said the government had issued more than 100 orders and notifications to address the glitches in the implementation of Aadhaar.

Urging the court to maintain status quo, the Attorney General urged the bench that no interim order should be passed.

Acting Labor Leader Tanya Plibersek said some decisions were likely to have left people feeling aggrieved.

""If they want to pursue the government on some of them, I don't doubt they will,"" Ms Plibersek told ABC radio on Monday.

""No doubt there will be some people who will be wondering whether they were treated fairly and whether decisions were made properly by Fiona Nash and Barnaby Joyce when they weren't properly elected to the parliament.""

The High Court would be asked to rule on whether the decisions were constitutionally valid, as they were made after the two ministers ceased to hold office last October.

However, Mr Joyce is confident the decisions he took as a minister will stand because his dismissal is not retrospective.

The former deputy prime minister and four senators were found to hold dual citizenship and constitutionally ineligible to nominate for parliament at the 2016 election.

Voters will go to the polls in his seat of New England on December 2.

Mr Joyce is expected to win, but the government will face a rocky time in the interim after losing its one-seat majority, especially when the House of Representatives next sits in the week of November 27.

Independent MP Cathy McGowan and NXT MP Rebekha Sharkie have indicated they will back the government in a no-confidence motion.

But potential votes on a banking royal commission and keeping Sunday penalty rates could yet prove a splintering headache for the Turnbull government.","Labor Claims 118 Joyce, Nash Ministerial Decisions Could Be Challenged",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/29/labor-claims-118-joyce-nash-ministerial-decisions-could-be-challenged_a_23260005/

Und fürchte nicht der Feinde Spott,

Bekämpfe mutig die Verneinung,

Theodor Fontane

Der Gnade bedürfen

Nun ist es soweit: 500 Jahre Reformation - oder besser: Von heute her gesehen begann mit dem 31. Oktober 1517 in Deutschland eine Entwicklung, die nicht nur zu einer weiteren innerchristlichen Konfession, dem Protestantismus, führte. Mit der Reformation wurden drei Themen auf die Tagesordnung zunächst des europäischen Lebens, dann auch global gesetzt: Freiheit, Bildung, Verantwortung. Sie bedürfen auch morgen der immer wieder neuen Durchdringung. Doch Ausgangspunkt für das reformatorische Wirken war eine tiefe Erkenntnis des Glaubens: Der Mensch bedarf der Gnade Gottes, um nicht an sich selbst zu verzweifeln. Diese kann er nicht selbst erzeugen. Sie ist ihm geschenkt durch Jesus Christus. Doch das, was mitten in dieser Welt greifbar nahe liegt, muss immer neu gesucht werden: die Erlösung. In dieses Suchen, vor allem in den Zuspruch der Erlösung, dürfen sich keine Institution, keine Hierarchie, kein Klerus und kein Papst beschönigend, beschwichtigend, Angst und abhängig machend zwischenschalten. Darum steht am Anfang jeder Zukunftsüberlegung zunächst die kritische Einschätzung des eigenen Lebens: die Buße. Sie ist aber nur dann mehr als eine sich selbst bemitleidende Zerknirschung, wenn sie in der Hoffnung auf Vergebung vollzogen wird: Nichts von dem, was mich jetzt noch von einem sinnerfüllten Leben abhält, also auch nichts von den Zerstörungskräften auf dieser Welt, hat vor Gott Bestand.

Spannungsbogen Freiheit und Bindung

In den Einsichten der Reformatoren lag so viel Sprengstoff, dass ihr Wirken zu Beginn des 16. Jahrhunderts in allen gesellschaftlichen Bereichen revolutionäre Umwälzungen auslösten. Menschen wurden aus selbstverschuldeter Unmündigkeit befreit und verlangten Teilhabe nicht zuletzt an Bildung, Arbeit, Einkommen. Menschen erkannten aber auch, dass all das, was der Glaube an Freiheit ermöglicht, vor Gott und den Menschen, also dem Nächsten, verantwortet werden muss. Der Spannungsbogen von Freiheit und Bindung darf nicht erstarren. Wenn und wo dies geschieht, verkümmert beides: Freiheit und Ordnung. In eine solche Krise geraten wir als einzelne Menschen wie als Institution täglich. Doch nicht nur Kirchen oder Christen stehen in der Gefahr zu verkrusten - auch andere gesellschaftliche Institutionen und Menschen mit keiner oder einer anderen religiösen Überzeugung. In diesem Sinn muss sich nicht nur die Kirche als eine pulsierende, den Geist der Freiheit atmende Institution erweisen, die durch das Wechselspiel von Buße und Umkehr den Aufbruch wagt. Diese Bewegung wird jeder und jedem abverlangt. Was wir aber ganz im Sinn Theodor Fontanes sagen können: Wer sich durch Gottes Geist antreiben lässt, der kann sich furchtlos und das Leben bejahend, auch genießend in dieser Welt bewegen. Das Ja Gottes zu meinem Leben überstrahlt allen Hang zur verneinenden Missmut. Genau das fasziniert bis heute viele Menschen am Auftreten eines Martin Luthers. Genau das macht Menschen wie Dietrich Bonhoeffer oder Martin Luther King zu Vorbildern des Glaubens.

Ängste nehmen

In diesem Sinn haben wir heute als Kirche zu wirken: Ängste nehmen und Menschen in ihrer so großen Unterschiedlichkeit und Vielfalt annehmen, zusammenführen und zu einem gemeinsamen Leben auf dieser Erde ermutigen. Im Protestantismus ist kein Platz für religiöse oder rassistische Ausgrenzung, für nationale und völkische Überheblichkeit und für gewalttätige Selbstbehauptung. Die einzige Grenze, die wir anerkennen, ist die des Todes - aber auch sie hat Jesus Christus überwunden. So beginnt alles Leben mit der Buße, der kritischen Betrachtung des Selbst: Ich bin wenig weniger als Gott (Psalm 8), aber keinesfalls mehr als der Nächste.",Gruß zum Reformationsfest 2017,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/christian-wolff/gru-zum-reformationsfest_b_18420956.html?utm_hp_ref=germany&amp;ir=Germany

NEW DELHI -- The Election Commission (EC) has announced the schedule of the upcoming crucial assembly elections in Gujarat.

The polls will be conducted in two phases. The polling for the first phase will be held on 9 December and for the second phase on 14 December.

The counting of the votes will be held on 18 December.

The last date for nominations is set to be 21 November.

The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), Achal Kumar Joti, announced that 50,128 polling booths would be set up and VVPAT machines will be used for the polls in the state.

The CEC also said the model code of conduct would come into force with immediate effect in the state, adding that a flash of light would be shown after voting showing details of the candidate who the voter has voted for.

CCTVs will also be installed along the border check-points, said the CEC, adding there would be 102 all-women polling stations for the polls in Gujarat.

Differently-abled voters will be given preference at the polling stations.

The state polls will witness a direct contest between the Congress and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Eyeing Patidar votes, the Congress has been trying to get support from their leaders to counter the saffron party in Gujarat, where they had been in power since 1995.

The contest is important for the BJP because Gujarat is the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah.

The election watchdog had earlier come under fire for not announcing the dates for Gujarat assembly polls, along with those of Himachal Pradesh.

The Opposition alleged that the poll body did not announce the date for Gujarat polls as it was pressurised by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to delay it.

The Election Commission had, however, rejected the Opposition's charge and asserted that no special preference was given to any political party.

""We have given equal opportunities to all political parties. We have not directed any party to hold or to not hold their rallies in the state. We are not meddling in their campaigns. Yesterday, the Prime Minister went to Gujarat. Today, Rahul Gandhi will go. We are not giving any special preference to any political party,"" Chief Election Commissioner Achal Kumar Joti had told ANI, in an exclusive interview.

The term of 13th state assembly ends on 22 January, 2018.

GORAKHPUR, Uttar Pradesh — Jaanvi Devi is terrified for her children every minute of the day.

The 32-year-old mother believes that her seven-year-old daughter Anchal and her four-year-old son Alok are risking their lives as long as they stay in Manbela village on the outskirts of Gorakhpur city.

Jaanvi's dilemma is that she has no way of leaving the village, which has been a hotbed of encephalitis, a deadly inflammation of the brain that kills hundreds of children in Uttar Pradesh, every year. The villagers call it ""brain fever"".

The soft-spoken woman with flawless skin and deep-set eyes, said, ""We live in terror every day. I feel afraid all the time. My children could be dead tomorrow and there is nothing I can do about it.""

""The fear never goes away,"" she said, pressing her chest. ""There is always a heaviness in the heart that something bad is going to happen.""

Jaanvi's remarks gave me a moment of pause. After a week of interviews, it was the first time I heard someone evoke pure terror while talking about encephalitis. The young mother's fears, however, are neither exaggerated nor farfetched.

Encephalitis does, in fact, kill four times the number of people that die in terror attacks in India every year. But there is little talk of the crisis that is consuming children from the poorest communities, enfeebled by malnutrition, poor hygiene and unsanitary living conditions.

In India, terror attacks claimed 289, 416 and 404 lives in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively, according to the Global Terrorism Index. In the same years, encephalitis killed 1,475 (2013), 2,012 (2014) and 1,501 (2015), the vast majority of them in UP.

When I asked her why she was terrified of encephalitis, Jaanvi said, ""It's like we are surrounded by death. It's only a matter of time before it strikes. Today, it is the family down the street. Tomorrow, it could be us.""

It's like we are surrounded by death. It's only a matter of time before it strikes.

Jaanvi said she didn't want to be counted among the mothers of Manbela village who have lost their children to ""brain fever.""

One of those grieving mothers is Champta Devi, who lost her daughter, Yashoda, three years ago.

""I was angry for a long time but I have nothing to say anymore. There's no point in being angry if you are poor. No one cares about us and nothing changes for us,"" she said.

Vidya Devi, who lost her seven-year-old son during the rainy season last year, is still inconsolable. ""He was alive in the morning and dead by the evening,"" she said.

While Champta and Vidya continue mourning their children, two other mothers, Ramvati Devi and Lalti Devi, spend day and night taking care of their daughters, who are living with crippling mental and physical disabilities that often follow encephalitis.

As she helped her children out of their school uniforms, Jaanvi said, ""I don't know who is suffering more: the mothers whose children are dead or the mothers who will have to help them defecate all their lives.""

He was alive in the morning and dead by the evening.

READ: In Uttar Pradesh, 'Surviving Encephalitis Could Be Worse Than Dying Of It'

Stuck in Manbela

Encephalitis has terrorised eastern UP for almost four decades, with one government after another at the Centre and in the state playing the part of a bystander.

Over 11,000 people have died of encephalitis in the past seven years alone. Not only have the authorities failed to roll out an effective vaccination programme, nothing has been done to combat the unsanitary living conditions that become havens for mosquitoes carrying the Japanese encephalitis virus found in pigs and wild birds.

Take, for instance, Manbela village, home mostly to daily wage labourers from the lower castes, located in the constituency of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and just a few kilometres away from the Baba Raghav Das Medical College, the largest government hospital in the district.

Even though it is just a half-hour drive from the grand temple complex that Adityanath presides over, Manbela is choking in its own filth and swarming with mosquitoes. Almost everyone in the village defecates in the open, mostly in the fields surrounding their houses.

But sanitation workers rarely visit to either clean or fumigate the village.

The villagers told me they recently had the opportunity to complain about the unsanitary living conditions to three officials from Delhi, who visited them after the BRD Medical College made national news for running out of liquid oxygen on August 12.

Gujrati Devi, the village matriarch, recalled, ""We all gathered under the tree by the temple. They asked us, 'Does someone come to clean the drains?' We said no. They asked us, 'does anyone come to kill the mosquitoes? 'We said no. They asked us, 'Do you have toilets?' We said no.""

""There was someone who was writing everything in her notebook like you are but then she went away and nothing changed,"" said Gujrati.

On one sweltering afternoon and during a power outage, Jaanvi explained her desperation to leave Manbela village and the two obstacles in her path: money and her in-laws.

""You can see that we are keeping our house clean but the outside is disgusting. I blame everyone who throws garbage in the drains and the streets,"" she said. ""You don't have to wait till nightfall to see the mosquitoes — just till four in the evening. It takes one mosquito to kill but here we have thousands.""

You don't have to wait till nightfall to see the mosquitoes - just till four in the evening.

While Jaanvi and Ajay, her husband, agree about leaving Manbela, they cannot make the move on the ₹5000 he earns working in an auto agency. ""The bigger problem is my husband's parents. They refuse to move from here and we cannot leave them behind. It would break their hearts,"" she said.

It's not that Jaanvi's in-laws don't know about the encephalitis threat. ""They have seen the deaths in the village but they don't understand why sanitation is important. If I push too much, it creates tension in the house and even my husband tells me to stop,"" she said.

And what about vaccination? While the state government claims to have launched a vaccination drive for 88 lakh children in the summer this year, neither Jaanvi nor her husband heard about the drive despite their proximity to the city and the medical college. ""There was no talk about it in the village. Do you know when is the next one? How can we find out about it?"" she asked.

Fighting back

During one of our conversations, Jaanvi recalled both the joy she experienced attending school and the heartbreak of forsaking her education. Instead of making a fuss, she quietly quit school, married the man that her father chose and went to live with her husband in Manbela village.

Over the course of her 32 years, Jaanvi has made her peace with other people making the important decisions of her life, but she refuses to accommodate the grim threat of encephalitis.

Even though she has failed to move her children out of Manbela village, Jaanvi is still fighting back. In a voice ringing with pride, the young mother narrated how she persuaded her husband to build a toilet as well as a bathing area inside the house.

""It's the only way to protect the children against mosquitoes. Defecating in the open is disgusting especially during the monsoon when the fields are filled with water. There are mosquitoes that bite when you squat,"" she said.

Defecating in the open is disgusting especially during the monsoon when the fields are filled with water.

Jaanvi's house is among the handful in Manbela village that have a toilet. Ajay says it cost them ₹80,000 to build both the toilet and the bath.

In addition to borrowing ₹30,000 from his relatives in Kanpur, Ajay also availed of the Modi's government's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to build the toilet in his house. He is still waiting for the government to transfer funds into his bank account.

""I received the initial ₹2,000 in July but ₹6,000 is still pending,"" he said. ""I really don't know how we are going to afford this.""

At this point in the conversation, Jaanvi reassured her husband that their children's health was worth any financial trouble they face. ""I have realised we have to protect our children. I don't think anyone else will help us,"" she said.

ISLAMABAD -- An accountability court on Thursday issued bailable warrants against ousted Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in cases relating to two of his properties, the media reported.

The Islamabad-based court wrapped up the first hearing in the Sharif family's London flats case after grilling the former leader's guranteer about his absence from the hearing, reports Dawn news.

The bailable warrants were issued for the Flagship Investment case and the Al-Azizia Steel Mills and Hill Metal Establishment case.

Meanwhile, the hearing on the Avenfield flats in London was adjourned until November 3.

The court had indicted Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz and her husband Captain Mohammad Safdar on October 19 in connection with a case pertaining to the Avenfield flats filed against them by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

The former Prime Minister was separately indicted in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills and Hill Metal Establishment cases.

All three accused pleaded not guilty to the charges, Dawn news reported.

On one fateful November night in 1983, Barbara Holland (Shannon Purser) attended a party at Steve Harrington’s (Joe Keery) house, simply hoping to keep an eye on her friend, Nancy (Natalia Dyer).

She wouldn’t make it home that night.

Or any night.

It’s kinda of hard to do that after you’re killed by a damn Demogorgon.

Barb’s death was covered up by nefarious characters at Hawkins Lab, and the show largely went on without her. That was originally going to be it. Purser herself has said that Barb “wasn’t supposed to be a big deal” in Netflix’s “Stranger Things.”

Barb wasn't supposed to be a big deal and you lovely people made her important. Thank you 💜 — Shannon Purser (@shannonpurser) August 20, 2016

But following the character’s death, fans rallied around her. The surge of support inspired think pieces and hashtags; Purser even ended up with an Emmy nomination.

Fans demanded #JusticeForBarb.

At San Diego Comic-Con over the summer, producer Shawn Levy described what “justice for Barb” would actually look like, telling HuffPost, “Someone’s to blame, and it’s not just a Demogorgon, so maybe her justice has to do with whoever else is responsible.”

In Season 2, those responsible finally pay:

Steve Harrington

“I did not mean to kill Barb. That was not my idea of a good time,” actor Joe Keery recently told HuffPost. He continued, “I don’t know if anyone remembers, but when she cuts her finger, I think I point her to the direction of the bathroom. I don’t think I’m trying to be a dick to her. Sorry, Barb. Rest in peace.”

Steve isn’t directly responsible for Barb’s disappearance, but she does go missing while waiting for him and Nancy to be done with their sexy time together. And for that, we demand justice.

Lucky for us, in the new season, Steve’s unwillingness to come forward about what happened to Barb ― at least to her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Holland ― contributes to his breakup with Nancy.

Sorry, Steve’s relationship. Rest in peace.

Nancy Wheeler

Netflix

Sure, Nancy once unknowingly left Barb to be dragged to her death in the Upside Down, but people make mistakes, right?

Her penance in Season 2 is bringing the truth to light. HuffPost also spoke to Dyer at Comic-Con, where she told us Nancy had an “itchiness” to do the right thing ever since Barb’s death.

“She’s upset, and she’s personally hurt, and she feels very responsible of course for the way that it happened,” Dyer said.

“It’s this feeling, ‘What can I do? How can I make this right with Barb’s family, with her town, with everything, with herself?’ There’s a lot of guilt, so she’s a girl on a mission.”

That mission: expose the truth to Barb’s parents and take down Hawkins Lab.

Hawkins National Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Energy

Netflix

Steve hesitates to come clean about Barb’s disappearance because the “Department of Energy” people at Hawkins Lab have put a lid on the situation. Anyone with knowledge of the incidents that happened in Season 1 is not allowed to talk about them, and the consequences of doing so could be dire.

But apparently Nancy has been occasionally having dinner with Barb’s parents. At a party, after way too much to drink, she can’t take the guilt anymore and seems set on her mission to expose the truth about her friend.

With help from Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton), Nancy calls Barb’s parents and very obviously tells them to meet her in a park, where she can reveal the truth about their missing daughter. There, Nancy and Jonathan are corralled by operatives of Hawkins Lab and later receive a threatening lecture from Dr. Owens (Paul Reiser), who says people at the facility will go to any means necessary to stop the truth from getting out.

Little does Owens know, however, Nancy was secretly recording him, providing evidence of a cover-up of Barb’s death.

This was the plan all along.

“They wanted to get taken by the Hawkins people,” Dyer confirmed on the “Stranger Things” aftershow, “Beyond Stranger Things.”

Armed with this information, Nancy and Jonathan go to Murray Bauman (Brett Gelman), an investigative reporter hired by Barb’s parents to look into her disappearance. Because the full story of the Upside Down is deemed too absurd for the general public, Bauman decides to “water it down” enough to make it believable. Instead of other dimensions, he suggests that Barb was exposed to dangerous toxins. Nancy is into it.

Netflix still

In the end, the incriminating tape is released and news of a so-called “chemical leak” is exposed. The lab is closed off, some apparent high-ranking individuals from the U.S. Department of Energy admit to a cover-up of Barb’s death and there is a funeral for her.

On “Beyond Stranger Things,” Dyer said Nancy accomplished her goal to give Barb’s parents closure ― but the cast wondered aloud if there could ever truly be justice for Barb.

Purser also made an appearance in the aftershow. “It’s such a sweet gesture to see that there were a lot of people that cared about Barb,” she said, admitting that it’s also “very weird to have a funeral and to see people crying over pictures of yourself.”

Following the release of the season, she tweeted, “Saying goodbye to the girl that started it all. So thankful.”

Shooting those pictures for Barb's house was a lovely and bittersweet event. Saying goodbye to the girl that started it all. So thankful. pic.twitter.com/yLGkIQtY4D — Shannon Purser (@shannonpurser) October 27, 2017

The Barb storyline wasn’t perfect, at times feeling like a distraction from the main plot centered around Will. But the fans demanded closure. No, they demanded justice. And that’s exactly what they got:

“Now what seems to have happened is the glass ceiling seems to have been shattered but running alongside that is a sort of fragility amongst women who aren’t able to cope with the treachery of the workplace.” Referring to allegations International Trade Minister Mark Garnier had asked his secretary to buy sex toys for him, Robinson added: “It shouldn’t be happening but on the other hand why have women lost confidence...

She added: “It would be helpful – and I say that in inverted commas – if women really, particularly older women in power, stopped it being tolerated. There needs to be a sort of collective amongst women because the flipside is that if it’s a youngster complaining about sexual harassment, not only is she unlikely to be believed, particularly if she’s complaining to a male boss but also that goes on her record. Who is going to hire someone who’s already made complaints in another workplace about sexual harassment?” While Robinson was heavily criticised on Twitter, there were some who spoke up her point of view. Joan Chalmers wrote: “Don’t often agree with Anne Robinson but good grief, stand up for yourselves as we had to do 40 years ago and we’ve survived and grown stronger.” Perdita echoed: “Anne Robinson was right.

With so much happening on-field, you wouldn't think an off-field incident would generate all the banter. But that's exactly what happened, because what transpired in the stands was either terrible or fabulous, depending on your point of view.

The raw facts, as witnessed on television by this reporter and backed up by the likes of sportswriter Will Brinson, are these: Yasiel Puig of the Dodgers slams a home run into the crowd. Woman catches it. Man grabs it off her, throws it back.

Which was ungentlemanly and plain rude, right? Right.

Unlike at the cricket here in Australia, baseballs are fair game for fans to keep. World Series balls are especially prized, and have pretty solid resale value for collectors.

With all that in mind, you can understand why U.S. sports site Deadspin, which thrives on cool stuff like this, called it ""Televised Larceny"", and added the riff from ""Been Caught Stealing"" by Jane's Addiction for good measure.

Many fans agreed.

As mentioned, however, there's a flipside to this argument.

Back in 1969, a Chicago Cubs fan threw back a home run ball as if to say ""we don't want this here"". It has since been regarded as a sign of true fandom to hurl the ball back if the home run was hit by a player from the away team.

The sensible middle ground seems to be this: that OK, sure, throw the ball back if you caught it yourself. But not if someone else did. That's just wrong.

Would I throw an opposing team's homer back? You bet.

An eight-month pregnant Dalit woman was allegedly beaten up so brutally by an upper caste woman and her son in Uttar Pradesh that she died six days later from the internal injuries. Adding insult to injury, doctors at the local district hospital didn't bother to check the woman properly when she was taken there after the attack and dismissed her since there was no external injury. Later, she died of internal head injuries. Her eight-month-old male foetus also died with her.

The Indian Express reports that Savitri Devi, a resident of Khetalpur Bhansoli village in Bulandshahr, made a measly Rs 100 a month by picking up trash from outside the homes of five upper-caste homes in her village. According to witnesses, she was her doing job as usual on October 18 when she lost balance and touched a bucket that was sitting outside another home she did not work for. Anju, the resident of the house, rushed out and was infuriated that a Dalit woman had 'defiled' her bucket and started raining punches on her pregnant belly. She also banged her head against the wall, following which her son Rohit joined her in assaulting Savitri.

Savitri's 9-year-old daughter, who was accompanying her, ran to the Dalit settlement to get help and managed to rescue her. On the same day, Savitri's husband went to lodge a complaint with the police but didn't manage to register one since the police pointed out that Savitri didn't have any external injuries. Police told The Indian Express that they lodged a complaint two days later after visiting the locality and speaking to eye-witnesses. Meanwhile, the hospital had returned the duo. On October 21, Savitri, who was in deep agony fainted from pain. She was rushed to the same district hospital which had sent her away. She was declared 'brought dead'.

The assailants are absconding.

This comes roughly two months of the lynching of another Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh. In Agra, 62-year-old Maan Devi was killed on the suspicion that she was a braid chopper and 'witch' who was cutting of women's hair in the village and adjoining areas.

This month itself, the naked corpse of a 14-year-old Dalit girl was found in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh.

Like adults, all children will have different reactions to a traumatic event, and how they react may depend on a combination of their age, personality and previous life experience.
The charity PTSD UK says that at the most basic level, PTSD is a “memory filing error” caused by a traumatic event, which and can affect anyone, regardless of their age.
“You may notice that they are less able to concentrate or they become easily distracted,” said Dr Rosan.
“There may also be changes in their behaviour such as becoming jumpy, finding it hard to sleep, having temper tantrums or being disobedient, or being overly clingy compared to usual,” said Dr Rosan.","And the risk of them subsequently developing the anxiety disorder PTSD is particularly high if the child’s family is facing poverty, unemployment or housing issues.

But actually more than two thirds of children in the UK are likely to have experienced a traumatic event by the age of 16, according to chartered clinical psychologist Dr Camilla Rosan, who helped to write the guide for social workers looking after the families affected by the Grenfell Tower fire .

Often associated with veterans returning from war zones, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may not seem like something that might affect a child.

Like adults, all children will have different reactions to a traumatic event, and how they react may depend on a combination of their age, personality and previous life experience.

But children are unlikely to know that they are suffering, and so will require parents to help them understand what they are going through.

Why might a child suffer from PTSD?

The charity PTSD UK says that at the most basic level, PTSD is a “memory filing error” caused by a traumatic event, which and can affect anyone, regardless of their age.

In fact one in three teenagers who survives a serious car crash and 40% of people who have lost a loved one suddenly will experience PTSD.

According to PTSD UK the defining characteristic of a traumatic event is whether or not it has the “capacity to provoke fear, helplessness, or horror in response to the threat of injury or death” so consider the event in those terms.

Young people are just as vulnerable to these triggers as adults.

“PTSD can occur after directly or indirectly experiencing a traumatic event that puts you or someone close to you at risk of serious harm or death,” said Dr Rosan, programme lead at the Mental Health Foundation.

“This can be anything from a road accident, to experiencing or witnessing violence or human accidents.”

What are the signs of PTSD in a child?

As with adults, the way children react to a trauma is likely to be individual to them as a person, but there are some tell-tale symptoms of PTSD that parents can be alert to.

Dr Rosan advised that it is likely children, who are older than toddlers, will experience a physical response, with symptoms such as an increased heart rate, sweating, rapid breathing and changes in appetite.

Your child might also become preoccupied with thoughts or images of the event or start experiencing nightmares and worrying that it will happen again.

“You may notice that they are less able to concentrate or they become easily distracted,” said Dr Rosan.

“A sudden onset of intense emotions is also to be expected – such as fearfulness, increased anxiety, anger or irritability.”

For younger children, physical symptoms might not be reported in these terms and instead they might tell you they have a headache or stomach ache.

“There may also be changes in their behaviour such as becoming jumpy, finding it hard to sleep, having temper tantrums or being disobedient, or being overly clingy compared to usual,” said Dr Rosan.

“Regressive behaviours are common, such as a resurgence of bedwetting or thumb-sucking.”

Le président républicain, dans une série de tweets ce dimanche 29 octobre, a une nouvelle fois dénoncé une ""chasse aux sorcières"" et réfuté la moindre ""collusion"" avec la Russie durant la campagne présidentielle de l'an dernier.

""Toutes ces histoires 'russes' juste quand les républicains s'attaquent à une baisse et réforme historiques des impôts. Est-ce une coïncidence? NON!"" a-t-il tweeté. L'avocat du président, Ty Cobb, a dans un message à CNN et Fox News indiqué que ces tweets n'avaient toutefois ""rien à voir avec les activités du procureur spécial, avec qui il continue de coopérer"".

La chaîne CNN, confirmée ensuite par d'autres médias, a révélé que l'équipe de Robert Mueller avait inculpé au moins une personne vendredi et pourrait procéder à une interpellation dès lundi. Depuis, aucun responsable n'a confirmé ou infirmé l'information, et on ignorait si cette personne était proche ou non de Donald Trump.

Transferts d'argent douteux

L'équipe Mueller restant muette, le ou les chefs d'inculpation restent également mystérieux. L'élu démocrate Adam Schiff, membre de la commission du Renseignement de la Chambre des représentants, a cité deux noms qui reviennent souvent dans la presse: l'ancien directeur de campagne Paul Manafort, et l'éphémère conseiller à la sécurité nationale Michael Flynn, tous deux ayant eu des activités de lobbying étranger non déclarées.

Le site Buzzfeed a indiqué dimanche que le FBI enquêtait sur une série de transferts d'argent en lien avec Manafort pour un total de 3 millions de dollars entre 2012 et 2013. Signalés comme douteux par les institutions financières américaines, certains des 13 transferts dont Buzzfeed a obtenu des détails concernent des virements venant d'Ukraine.

Selon le site, la justice a eu connaissance de ces transferts dès 2012, en enquêtant pour savoir si Manafort s'était rendu coupable de fraude fiscale ou s'il avait aidé le régime ukrainien -proche de Vladimir Poutine- à laver de l'argent sale.

Ty Cobb a assuré au New York Times que Trump était confiant dans le fait que ni Flynn ni Manafort n'avaient des informations qui pourraient lui porter tort à donner à la justice.

Tentative de déplacer l'affaire du terrain judiciaire au terrain politique

Là où les inculpations de lundi marqueront le franchissement d'une nouvelle étape de l'enquête de Robert Mueller, nommé en mai dernier pour reprendre en main l'enquête sur les ingérences russes dans la campagne de 2016, et établir l'existence ou non d'une collusion avec l'équipe du candidat républicain. Ces investigations sont distinctes de celles menées par plusieurs commissions du Congrès.

Le dirigeant américain, aidé par plusieurs élus républicains et une partie du monde conservateur, tente de déplacer l'affaire du terrain judiciaire au terrain politique. Il a allumé des contre-feux visant les démocrates et Hillary Clinton, accusée elle-même de collusion avec la Russie lors de la vente de la société canadienne Uranium One, détenant des mines américaines, au groupe public russe Rosatom en 2010.

La révélation que le camp Clinton et le parti démocrate avaient financé une enquête privée sur Donald Trump, et compilée dans un ""dossier"" sulfureux, a aussi fait couler beaucoup d'encre dans le camp conservateur.

""Jamais vu autant de colère et d'unité républicaine concernant l'absence d'enquête sur le faux dossier fabriqué par Clinton (...), sur la vente d'uranium à la Russie, sur les 33.000 emails supprimés, sur l'affaire Comey, et tant d'autres choses..."" a écrit Donald Trump sur Twitter, énumérant les diverses ""affaires"" Clinton.

58% d'opinions négatives

Cette accélération des investigations intervient à l'approche du premier anniversaire de l'élection de Donald Trump le 8 novembre 2016.

Le successeur de Barack Obama vante la bonne santé économique des Etats-Unis, avec une croissance de 3% au troisième trimestre. Mais sa popularité reste en berne, comme le confirme un nouveau sondage publié dimanche par NBC et le Wall Street Journal.

Marquant un point bas absolu depuis son entrée en fonctions en janvier, 38% des Américains approuvent l'action du 45e président des Etats-Unis, contre 58% d'opinions négatives. Ces chiffres masquent toutefois un fossé entre démocrates et républicains, dont 81% continuent à soutenir le président.

Teens who vaped in the 30 days prior to the start of the study were more likely to start smoking cigarettes and to continue smoking after one year.","Electronic cigarettes are seen in a display case at a store in downtown Montreal, Wednesday, May 6, 2015. A study looks at the use of electronic cigarettes among Canadian teens and whether it might lead to tobacco use.

TORONTO — Teenagers who use electronic cigarettes are at risk of graduating to tobacco smoking, a large Canadian study suggests.

The study of more than 44,000 Grade 9 to 12 students in Ontario and Alberta, published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ), shows a ""strong and robust"" linkage between so-called vaping and subsequent tobacco use.

""We found that youth that had used e-cigarettes were significantly more likely to start smoking a year later,"" said lead researcher David Hammond, a professor in the school of public health at the University of Waterloo.

""They're more likely to try smoking and they're more likely to become daily smokers.""

We'd be foolish if we weren't concerned about kids trying nicotine products at an earlier age than they typically try smoking. David Hammond, University of Waterloo

The big question, said Hammond, is whether it's the use of e-cigarettes that is making some young people smoke.

""A lot of what we're seeing in our study and a lot of other studies out there is a simple fact, and that is the kids who do risky things, the ones that are more likely to try e-cigarettes are also more likely to try smoking,"" he said from Waterloo, Ont.

""And guess what? They're also more likely to try alcohol and marijuana. It's all to do with the fact that kids who are susceptible are going to try different things.

""We've had something like two million Canadian youth try e-cigarettes and we'd be foolish if we weren't concerned about kids trying nicotine products at an earlier age than they typically try smoking.""

Teens who vaped in the 30 days prior to the start of the study were more likely to start smoking cigarettes and to continue smoking after one year.

The research, known as the COMPASS study, looked at e-cigarette use among students in 2013/14, with a follow-up a year later. Students were classified into six categories: current daily smokers, current occasional smokers, former smokers, experimental smokers, puffers; and those who had never tried smoking.

Those teens who vaped in the 30 days prior to the start of the study were more likely to start smoking cigarettes and to continue smoking after one year, researchers found.

""Youth may be trying e-cigarettes before smoking because they are easier to access,"" said Hammond, noting that tobacco cannot be sold to minors.

We don't want e-cigarettes to be a mechanism whereby youth get addicted to nicotine. Rob Cunningham, Canadian Cancer Society

Rob Cunningham, senior policy analyst for the Canadian Cancer Society, said vaping by young people is of significant concern.

""Certainly nicotine is addictive and we don't want e-cigarettes to be a mechanism whereby youth get addicted to nicotine,"" he said.

""And that's why it's so important to prevent kids from using e-cigarettes or starting smoking.""

While Canada has not approved nicotine-containing e-cigarettes for sale in conventional retail outlets such as supermarkets, the products are widely available online and in vape stores.

Non-nicotine e-cigarettes, which come in hundreds of flavours, do not require government approval to be sold and make up a large part of the market in Canada.

New regulation before House of Commons

However, that is expected to soon change. Bill S-5, which would create new regulations governing e-cigarettes, was approved by the Senate in June and is currently before the House of Commons.

Among its provisions, Bill S-5 would outlaw the sale of vaping products to minors and prohibit the promotion of e-cigarettes containing flavours that appeal to youth, as well as restricting advertising of these products.

But Cunningham said the provisions in Bill S-5 for e-cigarette advertising are weak compared to those for both tobacco and for cannabis, when the latter product becomes legal next year.

""And I think the bill should be amended to strengthen the restrictions on e-cigarettes advertising,"" he said.

While Canada has not approved nicotine-containing e-cigarettes for sale in conventional retail outlets such as supermarkets, the products are widely available online and in vape stores.

The Canadian Medical Association recommends a ban on the sale of all electronic cigarettes to those younger than the minimum age for tobacco consumption in their province or territory.

The doctors group also wants the licensing system tightened to limit the number of outlets where tobacco products, as well as vaping devices, can be purchased, along with restrictions on the promotion of e-cigarettes.

""Protecting Canada's youth should be of the utmost importance for government and health-care professionals alike,"" said CMA president Dr. Laurent Marcoux.

""The findings in this (study) provide even more evidence that the government should continue to work to limit sales and decrease the appeal of products that are often targeted towards Canada's youth,"" Marcoux said by email.

The CMAJ is editorially independent from the Canadian Medical Association.

Sehr gehr geehrter Herr Regierender Bürgermeister,

es gibt Interviews, die liest man und vergisst sie sofort wieder. Und es gibt Interviews, die einen nachdenklich stimmen und im Kopf bleiben. Ihr Interview mit der Berliner Zeitung vom 25. Oktober 2017 hat mich nicht nur nachdenklich gestimmt - es ist an Frechheit nicht zu überbieten!



""Billige Effekthascherei und Polemik"" ist es definitiv nicht, wenn man die anhaltenden Zustände in vielen Bereichen der Stadt kritisiert. ""Billige Effekthascherei und Polemik"" ist es vielmehr, sein eigenes Scheitern als Regierender Bürgermeister unserer Stadt als Erfolg zu verkaufen. Doch natürlich hat auch Berlin ‚Erfolgsgeschichten' vorzuweisen und darauf dürfen wir auch stolz sein!

Sie und Ihre Politik sind Teil des Problems, das bei vielen Menschen zu einem verlorenen Vertrauen in die Politik beiträgt

Der in der Wissenschaft von Ihnen beschriebenen ‚überall bestaunten Entwicklung' der vergangenen Jahre steht eine allgemeine Fehlentwicklung gegenüber, die Sie als ""Privatbürger"" schon lange leider nicht mehr sehen.



Es ist keine Leistung, dass Frau Scheeres für genügend neue Lehrkräfte gesorgt hat, sondern ihre Pflicht als Senatorin. Punkt! Ob sie diese Pflicht rechtzeitig und in genügendem Maß erfüllt hat, soll jeder für sich selbst entscheiden. Doch selbst wenn die Lehrer - zumeist Quereinsteiger - jetzt in den überfüllten, maroden Klassenzimmern stehen, landet unsere Stadt noch immer auf dem letzten Platz in allen Bildungsvergleichen.

Die Ansiedlung des Internet-Instituts macht es auch nicht wieder gut, dass mit dem Bau von bezahlbarem Wohnraum unter einer Senatorin Lompscher noch nicht einmal begonnen wurde - stattdessen holt sie Stasi-Spezi Holm immer wieder in ihr Team, dessen Expertise bislang keine notwendige Wohnung hat entstehen lassen. Der Gast-Dozent, der in die Wissenschaftsstadt Berlin kommt und keine Wohnung findet, wird sich freuen.

Sie verkennen, dass es nicht um ""da werden wir noch besser"" oder ""Schritt für Schritt merken es die Bürger"" geht. Sie und Ihre Politik sind Teil des Problems, das bei vielen Menschen zu einem verlorenen Vertrauen in die Politik beiträgt.

Seit Jahrzehnten regiert Ihre SPD unsere Stadt, die für viele Menschen leider mittlerweile gefühlt ein ""failed state"" ist. Es ist polemisch, wenn man diesen Eindruck nicht durch politisches Handeln entkräftet und bei den Wartezeiten in den Ämtern von ""immerhin halbiert"" spricht.

Sie sind ein politischer Hütchenspieler



Illegale Müllberge auf den Straßen, ein völlig desaströser Justiz-Apparat, eine nicht funktionierende Verwaltung, Armutsmigration aus Osteuropa, die die zuständigen Bezirke nicht allein lösen können und selbst Grüne-Bezirksbürgermeister aus der Not heraus mittlerweile zu politischen Hardlinern werden lässt.

Eine hohe Zahl an Einbrüchen am Stadtrand und tausende, schlecht ausgestattete und bezahlte Polizeibeamte, die zusehen können, wie ihre Kollegen im Nachbarland Brandenburg bereits seit Monaten die versprochene moderne Anti-Terror-Ausrüstung bekommen haben. Ja, es ist richtig, dass die Polizei nicht alles regeln kann, was Sie und Ihr Senat kaputt gemacht haben!

Sie sagen, alles, was hier funktioniert, ist für Deutschland ein Impuls - das ist nur leider nicht unsere Stadt, die wir lieben und mit deren Scheitern in so vielen Bereichen wir tagtäglich leben müssen.

Das merken die Menschen nicht zuletzt gerade bei Tegel: ein SPD-naher Gutachter, der den BER genehmigt hat, soll jetzt neutral entscheiden, ob der Flughafen Tegel offenbleibt. Merken Sie es eigentlich selbst noch, Herr Regierender Bürgermeister?

Sie ändern das Verfahren, ohne mit der Wimper zu zucken. Sie führen eine Entscheidung in der Sache im Abgeordnetenhaus herbei, obwohl diese Sachfrage längst von einer Mehrheit von knapp einer Millionen Menschen, verbunden mit einem klaren Auftrag zur Offenhaltung von TXL beantwortet wurde.

Um es mit den Worten Ihres Kollegen Raed Salehs zu sagen: Sie sind ein politischer Hütchenspieler. Ein politischer Hütchenspieler, der meint, mit einer arroganten Geste diesen klaren Sachauftrag der Berlinerinnen und Berliner einfach wegwischen zu können.



Diesen Auftrag haben Sie Ihnen nicht zuletzt auch gegeben, weil in der Luftfahrt keiner an Ihre Kompetenz glaubt, den BER zu eröffnen und den Luftverkehrsstandort Berlin zu stärken. Die Verantwortung im Aufsichtsrat haben Sie ja bereits abgegeben. Den Arbeitsnachweis Ihrer SPD-Regierungszeit dürfen jetzt nicht zuletzt die Mitarbeiter von Air Berlin erleben.

Als Bundesratspräsident wollen Sie ""Berlin als Brennpunkt solcher Entwicklungen"" einbringen. Meinen Sie damit die Brennpunkte Tiergarten, Kottbuser Tor oder Hermannplatz? Meinen Sie den Brennpunkt Schulen? Meinen Sie den Brennpunkt Verwaltung? Welchen der vielen Brennpunkte meinen Sie?



Damit Ihre Zeit als Regierender Bürgermeister nicht als Brennpunkt unserer Stadtgeschichte in eben diese eingeht, sollten Sie endlich die großen Probleme unserer Stadt angehen - oder Ihren Platz für einen fähigeren Kollegen freimachen.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Sebastian Czaja

FDP-Fraktionsvorsitzender

Bis zum Jahr 2025 sollten für Bildung und Forschung mehr als zehn Prozent des Bruttoinlandsproduktes (BIP) aufgewendet werden, heißt es in dem Papier.

Zudem wollen die Parteien die Ausbildungsförderung Bafög modernisieren und mehr Studenten einen Anspruch eröffnen. Die Aufwendungen für Forschung und Entwicklung, die Nahtstelle zwischen Hochschulen und Wirtschaft, sollen auf 3,5 Prozent des BIP erhöht werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Eine Grafik verrät, wie ungerecht die deutsche Bildungspolitik ist – doch niemand darf sie sehen

Für die Digitalisierung sei der Breitbandausbau wesentlich. Welche Technologie dazu genutzt werde - etwa Glasfaser - sei noch zu erörtern, machte CDU-Generalsekretär Peter Tauber deutlich.

Zudem sollen möglichst schnell Funklöcher auf dem Land geschlossen werden. Wo dieses Themenfeld angesiedelt werden soll - als selbstständiges Ministerium, bei Bildung und Forschung oder bei der Wirtschaft - sei offen, sagte Tauber.

""Jamaika könnte das Bündnis der digitalen Chancen sein""

Bei der Digitalisierung gehe es auch um den Ausbau der Datensicherheit, sagte FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer. Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner sagte: ""Jamaika könnte ... könnte das Bündnis der digitalen Chancen sein.""

Wie Beer hob er hervor, dass sich die Unterhändler klar zu einem modernen Datenrecht bekannt hätten - unter Wahrung der Bürgerrechte. Der auslaufende Hochschulpakt zwischen Bund und Ländern zur Bewältigung der hohen Studierendenzahlen solle verlängert werden.

Alle vier hoben hervor, dass sich die Arbeitsatmosphäre wesentlich verbessert habe. Kellner sagte, der Pulverdampf der vergangenen Woche sei wohl mit dem Wind vom Wochenende verflogen. Er sprach von einer ""sehr guten Arbeitsatmosphäre"".

Auch bei weiteren Themenblöcken bestehen Einigungen

Auch bei der Pflege haben sich die Parteien geeinigt: der Pflegebereich soll gestärkt werden. Dazu seien mehr Personal und bessere Ausstattung notwendig, sagte Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner am Montag in Berlin. Darüber hinaus seien für die Grünen die Beitragsparität bei den Beiträgen für die gesetzliche Krankenversicherung wichtig.

Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Bund und Ländern im Kampf gegen Terrorismus wollen Union, FDP und Grüne verbessern. Dabei solle die Koordinierungsfunktion von Bundeskriminalamt und Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV) stärker als bisher wahrgenommen werden, heißt es in einem Leitlinien-Papier zum Bereich Innen, Sicherheit und Rechtsstaat.

Der Einsatz von Videoüberwachung solle an Kriminalitätsschwerpunkten, an besonders gefährlichen Orten, Einrichtungen und bei Veranstaltungen gegebenenfalls auch befristet angeordnet werden können, heißt es weiter. Zudem sei die Cybersicherheit für die Zukunft Deutschlands von herausragender Bedeutung.

Nach dem Geheimtreffen der Parteichefs vom Sonntagabend waren die Jamaika-Unterhändler in der Tat bemüht, die aufgeheizte Stimmung abzukühlen.

CSU-Parteichef Horst Seehofer sagte vor Beginn der Sondierungen am Montag, die Runde der Vorsitzenden habe der Atmosphäre gut getan. ""Aber es ist jetzt nicht in einer Nacht leichter geworden. Einfach von der Sache her.""

Neben Bildung und Digitales standen auch die Themenbereiche Arbeit, Rente sowie Inneres und Recht auf dem Programm. Am Nachmittag kam der mehr als 50 Mitglieder große Kreis der Unterhändler zusammen, um eine Zwischenbilanz zu ziehen.

Bereits am Donnerstag wollen sie sich erneut an die Themen Migration und Klimaschutz machen, die in der vergangenen Woche zu massivem Streit geführt hatten und vertagt worden waren.

In der Zuwanderungspolitik ist der Familiennachzug für Flüchtlinge einer der Knackpunkte. Beim Klimaschutz gab es vergangene Woche Krach darüber, wie die nationalen und internationalen Ziele zur Treibhausgas-Minderung erreicht werden sollen.

But even though the season closes with a reunion between Mike and his romantic crush (she’ll never l’Eggo, Mike), “Stranger Things 2” was less a nod to young love and more a perfect salute to young friendship.","Spoilers below for “Stranger Things 2.” You’ve been warned!

Strange things happen on “Stranger Things” Season 2, but there’s one friendship, in particular, that keeps us all from flipping upside down.

Although the bond between the four lead kids ― Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin) and Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) ― captivated audiences last season, the new installment shines an even more powerful spotlight on the specific connection between two of its most empathetic characters: Mike and Will.

What’s so great about “Stranger Things” is that it places honest portrayals of relationships between friends, parents and children directly in the middle of its sci-fi fantasy conundrums. Rarely do we get to witness authentic male friendships on screen that reflect the actual realities of growing up, and the Duffer Brothers give us that opportunity. Through Mike and Will, we experience real tenderness between boys ― boys who are capable of expressing their emotions and asking each other the simple but necessary question: “Are you OK?” They, like the girls in so many well-told tales of youth, can look each other in the eyes and reply, “No.”

Mike and Will didn’t get to share a lot of screen time together last season when Will was living in the nether. But now that he’s back in Hawkins proper, Mike is as worried about his friend as Will’s mother (Winona Ryder) is. While Dustin and Lucas are focused on impressing the new girl Max (Sadie Sink), Mike is more concerned with Will’s well-being and the freaky “episodes” that are preventing him from living a normal life. Sure, Mike’s also preoccupied with Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and her whereabouts, but he seems to sense that his best friend, whose brain is being violently haunted by a shadow monster, needs him now more than ever.

In a sweet scene from Chapter 2, “Trick or Treat, Freak,” Mike and Will sit in the Wheeler basement and discuss what’s really been going on with Will since he returned from the Upside Down.

Mike: Is this all real? Or is it like the doctors say, all in your head? Will: I don’t know. Just please don’t tell the others, OK? They won’t understand. Mike: Eleven would. Will: She would? Mike: Yeah. She always did. Sometimes I feel like I still see her. Like she’s still around, but she never is. I don’t know. Sometimes I feel like I’m going crazy. Will: Me, too. Mike: Hey, well, if we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go crazy together, right? Will: Yeah, crazy together.

This moment speaks volumes of the sensitivity surrounding these two young characters. Mike knows Will is in a fragile state, so instead of harping on his own pain, he uses it to relate to Will and reassure him. No semblance of competition. No teasing. Just pure understanding.

We see this behavior play out again in another poignant scene from Chapter 5, “Dig Dug.” Mike, the only kid not entirely obsessed with a pollywog-turned-Demodog Dustin rescued from a trash can, goes to the Byers’ house to see where Will’s been since he blacked out at school.

Will’s mom, Joyce, who is very much aware of her son’s episodes with an alternate reality, is skeptical at first about inviting Mike in, not knowing that Will has already confided in him. Once inside, Mike gazes in awe upon the startling map Will created using his “now-memories.” But instead of freaking his friend out even more, Mike sits with Will, eases his mind, and rightly tells him that he can use these visions to his advantage.

“Just think about it, Will,” Mike tells him. “You’re like a spy now. A super spy, spying on the shadow monster! If you know what he’s seeing and feeling, maybe that’s how we can stop him. Maybe all this is happening for a reason.”

When Will suggests that the monster might be spying back at him, Mike assures his clearly shaken friend. “We won’t let him,” he says. His advice is decidedly more mature than the pearls of wisdom dispensed by everyone’s favorite out-of-touch newbie, Bob (Sean Astin). (“Go away” apparently doesn’t work on a relentless shadow monster.)

Sadly, the Mind Flayer has a bigger grip on “zombie boy” than those around him realize. It seems to be chiseling away at Will’s personal memories, as well as his physical state. As Will loses more and more of who he is to the monster using his body as a host, Mike stays by his side. While his other friends are distracted by girls, cat-eating creatures and Steve Harrington’s hair, Mike, alongside Joyce and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), tries to remind Will of their past experiences, providing his friend with the life preserver he needs as his reality slips away.

In Chapter 8, “The Mind Flayer,” the group watches as the shadow monster tightens his hold on Will. They tie him up in Joyce’s shed and share stories of their time together before a teary-eyed Mike attempts to reach Will.

Do you remember the first day that we met? It was the first day of kindergarten. I knew nobody, I had no friends and I just felt so alone and so scared, but I saw you on the swings and you were alone, too. You were just swinging by yourself and I just walked up to you and I asked ... I asked if you wanted to be my friend. And you said yes. You said yes. It was the best thing I’ve ever done.

Vulnerability makes an appearance again. Even if the shadow monster is the ultimate recipient of his story, Mike’s not afraid of his emotions, nor is he threatened by the group of people standing around him as he makes his tearful plea. He’s a self-assertive young man who truly wants to reach his lost friend, judgment be damned. He cares.

The storytelling roundtable doesn’t work the way they intended it to, but it does lead Will to a solution. He uses Morse code to communicate with his family and friends, letting them know that he is indeed listening. And the group continues to share heart-wrenching stories in response, until Will delivers a crucial clue for stopping the Mind Flayer: “Close gate.” In the end, every plan the team concocts works out, and Eleven, in her triumphant return, is able to confine the Mind Flayer to the Upside Down ... for now.

But even though the season closes with a reunion between Mike and his romantic crush (she’ll never l’Eggo, Mike), “Stranger Things 2” was less a nod to young love and more a perfect salute to young friendship. The tender moments between Mike and Will throughout the last nine chapters allowed the audience to experience a hug-rather-than-push adolescent connection so often left out of stereotypical coming-of-age sagas. An image of boys wrestling for a game controller, hurling insults and chuckling mercilessly, is replaced for a second by an image of two kids, in their matching “Ghostbusters” Halloween costumes, having the kind of tough, uncomfortable conversation that marks a real friendship.

Understanding more about Mike and Will’s bond will surely inform future seasons of “Stranger Things.” As the months and years roll on, we’re eager to see how these characters grow ― and how their relationships take shape in the process. Here’s hoping Mike and Will continue to show us that young boys can have complicated, emotionally mature relationships, too.

Et pas n'importe quels whiskies, je veux bien entendu parler de whiskies français. Car au-delà du marketing et de l'étiquette (originale!) de la bouteille du D.U.C. whisky, j'ai été interpelé par le discours de la maison Daucourt, qui promeut, à l'instar d'autres producteurs, nos couleurs à l'international. Le whisky français monte en puissance depuis quelques années déjà, au point de commencer à devenir une alternative crédible au tout puissant écossais.

D.U.C whisky, une occasion d'exporter le whisky français à l'international

Cette collaboration entre la maison Daucourt et ce rappeur est très certainement une belle opportunité pour cette eau-de-vie de malt d'être sous le feu des projecteurs. Précisons tout de même que son existence ne date pas d'hier puisque des écrits relatent la distillation de céréales en France depuis plus de trois siècles ! (Source Alexandre Vingtier) De son côté, Maison Daucourt n'en est pas à son premier coup d'essai et n'a pas attendu Booba pour défendre l'étendard: Bastille 1789, sorti depuis maintenant 4 ans, s'inscrivait en effet dans la logique de faire connaître le savoir-faire français à l'international.

""Je fais des dons de *whisky, pour que la France entière se désaltère""

Le D.U.C. whisky, d'ors et déjà disponible en grandes surfaces, est un assemblage de 3 whiskies différents ayant vieilli -entre 3 et 8 ans- chacun dans des fûts à finition particulière: Sauternes, Bourbon et Cognac. Grâce au vieillissement en fût de Sauternes, il m'a semblé que le D.U.C. whisky possède un côté doux et sucré en bouche qui trouvera sans aucun doute son public: ""après dix Jack D.U.C. ma soirée sera paradisiaque"" peut à présent dire l'artiste.

Pour d'autres (comme moi), sachez que le whisky français ne s'arrête pas là! Laissez-moi vous guider autour des belles aventures cocorico pour vous pousser à boire le whisky bleu-blanc-rouge.

Plusieurs décennies de savoir-faire français partout dans l'hexagone

Mes dix années d'amour pour les spiritueux m'ont en effet fait découvrir bon nombre de beaux whiskies français aux multiples facettes et aux caractères vraiment différents les uns des autres. Je suis persuadé que chaque amateur, novice ou chevronné, saura trouver son bonheur dans un whisky de nos contrées: Bretagne, Charente, Corse, Lorraine, massif du Jura, Alpes françaises... le whisky français n'a ni limite géographique ni limite d'originalité et il nous le fait sentir!

Commençons au coeur des Alpes où Frédéric Revol est sans doute l'un des pionniers incontestables de cette mouvance. Frédéric Revol a fondé en 2009 le Domaine des Hautes Glaces, mais il a fallu quelques années pour que son premier single malt nous arrive: 3 années de vieillissement sont en effet obligatoires pour que le whisky puisse en porter le nom. La création de sa ferme-distillerie est née d'une vision: la volonté d'avoir un contrôle total sur sa production. Cet OVNI produit donc son whisky de A à Z, de la culture de la céréale jusqu'à l'élevage en barrique de ses distillats. Le groupe Rémy Cointreau a acquis le Domaine des Hautes Glaces en 2016, ajoutant ainsi de beaux produits à son portefeuille et permettant au producteur d'être distribué à plus grande échelle et de permettre aux consommateurs de pouvoir retrouver ces petits bijoux un peu partout sur le territoire.

Partons à présent en terre lorraine, où j'ai découvert Rozelieures en 2014. La marque est née de la passion de deux hommes, Hubert Grallet et Christophe Dupic, l'un distillateur, l'autre céréalier, pour mettre au point le premier whisky de la région. La marque existe depuis plus de 10 ans. C. Dupic est un personnage passionné et passionnant avec une véritable démarche d'excellence et de tradition, comme en témoigne leur moyen d'application, la distillerie Grallet, vieille de plus de 150 ans ! Rozelieures est particulièrement réputé pour certains de ses whiskies (très) tourbés, mais la maison propose également une gamme exhaustive qui saura satisfaire l'amateur de whiskies non fumés.

D'autres jouent avec plusieurs cartes en main: certains distillateurs ont également démarré -et continuent- en tant que brasseurs de bière. C'est notamment le cas de Rouget de l'Isle, brasserie et distillerie qui revendique son ""Made In Jura"" et qui propose des whiskies de grande qualité aux saveurs envoûtantes avec des passages en fûts de vins de la région: Macvin, vin de paille...

""Au Nord, au Sud, à l'Est, à l'Ouest, b****, viens pas tester la Ouest Side""

Pour les amoureux des embruns et de la mer, allons en Bretagne (oui, j'ai moi aussi l'impression de me la jouer Fred et Sabine dans ""c'est pas sorcier"") toquer à la porte de la distillerie Warenghem. Celle-ci s'est notamment illustrée pour ses liqueurs souvent bien utiles en cocktail mais aussi pour son Chouchen, cet alcool si fièrement breton! Son whisky, du nom évident d'Armorik, existe depuis 1998 et est composé d'une gamme de 4 whiskies permanents, aux finitions travaillées et souvent à prix doux. J'apprécie particulièrement le sherry finish pour ses arômes subtils de fruits secs et ses notes épicées.

Finissons notre tour de France chez Bercloux, brasserie et distillerie située à 50 km à vol d'oiseau de la maison Daucourt, en pleine Charente, dont je n'ai pu que soutenir la démarche originale: un appel au financement participatif fin juillet 2016 pour acquérir l'alambic indispensable à la distillation du whisky et pour lancer la production d'un whisky ""premium"" 100% français. Bercloux promeut également le ""bio"" pour certains de ses produits: on y trouve notamment des liqueurs menthe poivrée et thym-citron et une absinthe que je vous recommande.

vergangene Woche stieg ich nach einem langen Arbeitstag in den Zug. Sie setzten sich neben mich. Sie sprachen mich an und ich warf Ihnen einen abweisenden Blick zu. Ich war nicht in der Stimmung für Smalltalk.

""Kommen Sie aus Stuttgart?"", fragten Sie mich und deuteten auf meine Tasche, die tatsächlich von einem kleinen Stuttgarter Label stammt. Sie sahen mich erwartungsvoll an.

Ich hatte eigentlich keinen Nerv, mich zu unterhaltenSmalltalk, aber Ihr Lächeln löste etwas in mir aus.

Mir fiel auf: Außer Ihnen lächelte niemand in dem ganzen Waggon. An den Gesichtern der Menschen konnte ich erkennen: Alle waren fertig von der Arbeit, der Uni, der Schule.

Ich dachte: Wieder eines dieser kurzen Gespräche, die man aus Höflichkeit führen muss

Alle wollten nur nach Hause. Die Stimmung war wie ein grauer Schleier, der sich über den ganzen Waggon gelegt hatte.

Nicht einmal die Kassiererin bei dm hatte zurückgelächelt, als ich ihr ein paar Minuten zuvor am Bahnhof Payback-Karte gereicht hatte.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich habe eine Woche lang jeden Tag einen Fremden angesprochen - das ist mir passiert

Sie begannen also, über meine Tasche zu reden und ich dachte: Na toll, wieder eines dieser kurzen Gespräche, die man aus Höflichkeit führen muss. Aber dann geschah etwas, das ich nicht erwartet hatte.

Die Smalltalk-Barriere war innerhalb kürzester Zeit wie weggeblasen. Wir unterhielten uns über unsere Familien, das Reisen und die Freiheiten meiner Generation. Zum ersten Mal seit Langem saß jemand neben mir, der wirklich zuhörte.

Zuhören, nicht um zu antworten

Nicht, um zu antworten. Nicht, um eine besondere Information herauszupicken, die er auf sich beziehen konnte, wie ""Oh, du hast also gerade eine Trennung hinter dir? Also bei mir war es damals wirklich schwer, ich habe nächtelang geweint.""

Sie waren jemand, der zuhört, um zu verstehen. Jemand, der nachhakt, mitfühlt. Und das nicht, weil er auf irgendetwas hinaus ist.

Irgendwann fiel das Thema auf einen guten Freund von mir, der vor ein paar Wochen in einem Motorradunfall verunglückt ist.

Von Ihnen kam kein: ""Ja, ich hatte da auch mal einen Freund, der einen Motorradunfall hatte. Ganz schlimm war das für mich."" Sie sagten einfach: ""Das muss richtig weh getan haben, oder? Wie war das, als Sie es erfahren haben?""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Schluss mit der Oberflächlichkeit!

Ich muss Sie komplett entgeistert angesehen haben. So offen und unverstellt hatte mich das noch nie jemand gefragt. Nicht einmal meine engsten Freunde. Sie haben mich in dem Moment zu Tränen gerührt. Auch Sie teilten etwas von sich mit mir.

Dabei kannte ich nicht einmal Ihren Namen

Sie erzählten mir, wie Sie die Liebe ihres Lebens verloren und wie gerne Sie Oma geworden wären. Es fühlte sich an als würden wir uns seit Jahren kennen. Dabei kannte ich nicht einmal Ihren Namen.

Wir fuhren etwa eine Stunde gemeinsam im Zug und redeten ohne Pause. Dann kamen wir in Ebersberg an. Ihre Station. Sie erhoben sich und richteten Ihren Mantel. Ich wollte nicht, dass Sie gehen.

Ich hatte Ihnen doch gerade so ziemlich mein ganzes Leben anvertraut. Sie bedankten sich für das Gespräch und mit einem letzten Lächeln schwanden sie durch die automatische Tür.

Da saß ich, wieder allein mit all den müden und kaputten Gesichtern. Wehmut überkam mich.

Liebe fremde Frau im Zug: Ich weiß weder Ihren Namen, noch wo Sie im Moment sind. Aber ich möchte mich bei Ihnen bedanken - dafür, dass Sie mir gezeigt haben: Es gibt noch Menschen, die wirklich zuhören. Nicht, um zu antworten, sondern um zu verstehen.

Ich war Ihnen in dieser Stunde im Zug näher als ich es den meisten meiner Freunde jemals gewesen bin.

Commenting on the day the Stonewall spokesperson said: “We welcome Intersex Awareness Day as a great way to encourage conversation around the issues facing intersex people and ending the stigma they face.”","So what does it mean to be intersex and what are some of the challenges intersex people face?

Yet identifying as intersex is something we still rarely speak about.

It’s thought that around 1.7% of the global population is born intersex, just fewer than the 2% of the world’s population estimated to have red hair.

Each year on the 26 October, the world marks Intersex Awareness Day.

What does intersex mean?

Speaking to HuffPost UK, a spokesperson from LGBT+ rights charity Stonewall explained what intersex means.

“Intersex is a term used to describe a person who may have biological attributes of both sexes or whose biological attributes do not fit with societal assumptions about what constitutes male or female,” they said.

“Intersex people may identify as male, female or may not identify as either.”

Although Stonewall doesn’t don’t work specifically on intersex issues, the charity does liaise with intersex groups and share relevant information and evidence to promote equal rights for all.

What challenges do intersex people face?

Because of the lack of public awareness about being intersex, Maya Posch didn’t even know it existed until the age of 21.

“I was born a hermaphrodite [a person with male and female sex organs or other charicteristics], but didn’t figure this out until I was 21,” Maya previously blogged.

“The main reason was the highly conservative country I grew up in (the Netherlands), which prevented me from learning about intersex even being a thing for so long.

“I only learned about it while doing research on the internet and stumbling over the term on Wikipedia.”

Similarly Susannah Temko didn’t find out about intersex variations until adolescents and says many children face surgery in order to conform to gender norms.

“At 16, I was told about my intersex variation. I learnt that I have XY chromosomes and streak gonads instead of ovaries, which had been removed months before,” Susannah blogged.

“In many countries, intersex children are subjected to repeated surgery and treatment to try to change their sex characteristics and appearance, causing terrible physical, psychological and emotional pain - and violating their rights.

“The interventions are often driven by the fear of non-binary bodies, rather than any medical need.”

What is Intersex Awareness Day?

Intersex Awareness Day occurs every year on 26 October while global Intersex Day of Solidarity occurs on 8 November.

Both events are dedicated to raising awareness about intersexuality and fighting for equality, by sharing the stories of intersex people around the world and signposting what still needs to be done.

MOGADISHU - An Islamist attack on a hotel in the Somali capital ended on Sunday after 25 people had been killed in a near 12-hour siege, police said, underlining the insurgents' ability to carry out deadly attacks in the heart of the city.

""The death toll rises to 25 people including police, hotel guards and residents. The death toll may rise. We suspect some other militants disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued,"" police officer Major Mohamed Hussein told Reuters.

""Three militants were captured alive and two others blew up themselves after they were shot,"" he added.

The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday with a car bomb. Gunmen then stormed the building after the bomb had destroyed its defenses. The siege ended on Sunday morning.

A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel.

The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and a next door hotel was also damaged. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels because they offer better security from attack.

Islamist group al Shabaab claimed the attack on Saturday. They want to overthrow the weak, U.N.-backed government and impose a strict form of Islamic law.

Anche lui punta ad un'assemblea di Campo Progressista l'11 novembre, per chiarire e chiarirsi. Eppure ieri il segretario Dem ha inviato uno dei suoi, il sottosegretario Sandro Gozi, all'iniziativa di Bonino e Pisapia a Roma. A vuoto, evidentemente. Almeno per ora.

""Stanno alzando il prezzo per le candidature nei collegi: quello che oggi vale 2, all'indomani del voto in Sicilia può addirittura valere 5"". Nella cerchia del segretario se li spiegano così i no e le mancate risposte finora raccolti. Dopo le regionali e sotto l'influsso dell'ormai avvenuta approvazione del Rosatellum, il dibattito ""si polarizzerà"", scommettono. E il Pd riuscirà a stringere alleanze ""quanto meno con realtà territoriali della sinistra e del centro, se non con i leader nazionali"". Programma vago, che dipende molto dai rapporti di forza che si determineranno dopo il test elettorale in Sicilia.

Ma è questo un po' il senso del treno elettorale che Renzi porta in giro per l'Italia a caccia di candidati forti a livello locale da piazzare nei collegi per battere la concorrenza cinquestelle soprattutto. E per piazzare gente di fiducia in lista, piuttosto che pretendenti di altre correnti del Pd. Non a caso a Pietrarsa è stato chiaro su questo: ""Nei collegi non servono le preferenze"". Avvertimento a Dario Franceschini, Andrea Orlando e gli altri dirigenti non renziani. Della serie: le liste le faccio io, unico strumento di potere reale sul partito, quanto basta per governarlo almeno fino alle politiche.

E' l'unico test elettorale che Renzi ha in mente. Dalla Sicilia si tiene lontano. Mentre tutti i leader nazionali, da Grillo a Berlusconi fino a Salvini, si catapultano in Sicilia per l'ultima settimana di campagna elettorale, Renzi ferma il treno e se ne va negli Stati Uniti. Domani incontrerà i ricercatori italiani del Fermilab, a Batavia nell'Illinois, insieme ad esponenti della ricerca scientifico-tecnologica come Francis Cordova, direttrice della National Science Foundation. Poi terrà un intervento sull'Europa alla Northwestern University, quindi parteciperà ai lavori della Obama Foundation Summit, per intervenire come 'keynote speaker' dopodomani mattina. Ma la trasferta americana gli serve anche per la campagna elettorale per le politiche: in agenda, un incontro con i rappresentanti del Pd nel Nord America, per il capitolo 'candidature all'estero'.

Tornerà in Italia solo a campagna elettorale siciliana conclusa. Di fatto, la dà per persa, come è nelle aspettative dei sondaggisti e di tutti gli osservatori politici. ""Non abbiamo mai vinto in Sicilia"", ammette rassegnato un renziano doc per negare la valenza nazionale del test del 5 novembre e preparare così la difesa agli attacchi interni. Ma pur mettendo nel conto la sconfitta, al Nazareno il vero incubo è che il candidato Micari arrivi addirittura quarto, dopo Musumeci del centrodestra, Cancelleri del M5s e anche dopo il candidato di Mdp Claudio Fava. A quel punto anche il dibattito sulla coalizione potrebbe risultare compromesso.

Per ora Renzi ha messo un punto fermo: coalizione sì, ma senza primarie per la premiership. Sa che tra i suoi critici nel Pd le sognano per indebolirlo. ""Però se il loro intento è rafforzare Gentiloni a danno di Renzi, non lo raggiungerebbero: perché il premier che resterebbe fuori dalla corsa in quanto il candidato comunque sarebbe il segretario"", spiegano dall'inner circle renziano. ""E poi ""non vediamo altri candidati che potrebbero presentarsi, l'unico potrebbe essere Pisapia..."". Appunto.",Le regionali in Sicilia bloccano la coalizione di centrosinistra.

In recent years, the most discussed ""solution"" to obesity and so-called unhealthy habits is the introduction of sales taxes on sodas and sugary drinks. The theory is that, by raising the price of these items, a tax will discourage their consumption, which means that we will ingest fewer calories and consume less sugar. In the long run, health problems related to obesity might become less common.

Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre.

Taxes can reduce the consumption of the goods they affect — that's pretty straightforward economics. However, the effect of a tax can be quite small and, in the end, have a negligible impact on consumption. The question, then, is how much a tax will matter. If the tax is low, then the effect will be negligible at best.

But even if the tax is high, people might simply be encouraged to substitute untaxed sugary drinks for heavily taxed sugary drinks. This is because the matter of which products to tax is not clear-cut. For instance, should cranberry juice be taxed? Tim Horton's coffee? Chocolate milk? Or do you just go after the ""bad guys"" like Pepsi and Coca-Cola? After all, it's quite easy to put the blame on them for the choices consumers make.

A recent study about a sugary drink tax in the city of Berkeley in California offers the starkest illustration of this point. To investigate the effect of the special sales tax of one penny per fluid ounce, a group of economists studied the sales of sugary drinks in a local university before the political campaign for the adoption of the tax, during the campaign, and after the enactment of the tax.

Persuasion and information are potent tools for changing behaviour.

The reason for this approach is that during the campaign, voters were exposed to information regarding the adverse health effects of consuming too much sugar. This influx of new information changed their preferences and led them to consume fewer sugary drinks, regardless of the price. By reducing consumption, it generated the same effect as a tax, but we must be careful to separate the effect of the tax with that of the extra information.

This is why that study is important. It shows that a substantial share of the decline in sugary drink consumption occurred before the change in prices caused by the tax. In fact, consumption fell by 30 per cent before the implementation of the tax. In contrast, there was very little effect after the tax was implemented.

This is not the only study to find such a result. Studying the effect of a California referendum on an animal welfare issue related to egg production, economist Jayson Lusk found that the publicity surrounding the referendum changed the preference of consumers significantly. In the lead-up to the vote, sales of cage-free and organic eggs increased by 160 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. While the proposition ended up passing, barring the use of cages in egg production in the state, a major change in consumption habits resulted from the information voters were exposed to before voting took place.

Persuasion and information are potent tools for changing behaviour. They change the preferences of consumers who can make more enlightened decisions about what they choose to consume. As such, these appear to be quite effective alternatives to the heavy-handedness of taxes when it comes to shaking off those extra pounds.

Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Uttar Pradesh has the unenviable fortune of finding its way into the news.

After weeks of turmoil on the campus last month, over the alleged sexual assault of a woman student, The Telegraph reported on Friday of yet another incident of attack on a student at the prestigious institution of higher education.

Munish Krisil Samy, a student from Fiji, was allegedly accosted by a group of seniors and asked to address them as 'Sir'. Although cornered, Samy refused to do so and paid a price for his resistance.

""I told them we are all equal as students and cannot call each other 'Sir',"" he told the reporter. ""They thrashed me at that time.""

But his ordeal didn't end there. The seniors took him to a restaurant on campus where they flung scalding hot tea on his face.

An FIR has been lodged since then and investigations are on to nab the criminals. Under anti-ragging laws, the culprits could be expelled from the institution and imposed heavy penalties on, but clearly, these are not deterrent enough for such atrocities to end.

A study carried out by a committee mandated by the Supreme Court (SC), funded by the University Grants Commission (UGC), revealed the persistence of ragging in many higher education institutions across India.

Based on a sample of over 10,000 students from different parts of the country, the report indicates that an overwhelming number of victims, as high as 84%, did not complain about ragging by their seniors or peers. About 36% believe ragging prepares them for the world, so they don't find anything unnatural about this perverse 'rite of passage'.

BHU's reputation of being in the thick of incidents detrimental to its students' well-being is notorious by now. Earlier this year, the authorities allegedly expelled a woman student from its hostels for showing 'homosexual tendencies'.

When students gathered to protests against sexual assault on women on campus, the police thrashed them and lodged FIRs against 1,000 of them. Amidst the outcry, the incident of a man gangraped on campus last year, which the authorities allegedly had tried to hush up, came up again.

The biggest challenge and the top priority in Kashmir are to deradicalize Kashmiri youth and militants and prevent it from turning into a Syria of India, says Dineshwar Sharma, the newly-named interlocutor for talks in Jammu and Kashmir.

An old Kashmir hand, who headed the Intelligence Bureau (IB) for two years from December 2015, Sharma says his mission to bring an end to violence would also include talking to anyone ""even a rickshaw puller or a cart puller"" who can contribute so that peace is ushered in the state ""as soon as possible"".

He says he is personally pained to see the path Kashmiris, particularly youth, have chosen that would only destroy the society.

""I feel the pain and sometimes I become emotional also. I want to see this kind of violence ends as soon as possible from all sides. The youth of Kashmir like Zakir Musa (Kashmir Al Qaeda chief) and Burhan Wani (slain Hizbul Mujahideen commander) get hype when they talk about (establishing Islamic) Caliphate,"" Sharma told IANS in an interview, referring to the new-age Kashmir militant commanders.

He said the way youth of Kashmir were moving, ""which is radicalization"", would ultimately ""finish the Kashmir society itself.

""I am worried about the people of Kashmir. If all this picked up, the situation will be like Yemen, Syria and Libya. People will start fighting in so many groups. So, it is very important that everybody, all of us, contribute so that suffering of Kashmiris end.

""I will have to convince the youth of Kashmir that they are only ruining their future and the future of all Kashmiris in the name of whether they call it azadi (independence), Islamic caliphate or Islam.""

""I will have to convince the youth of Kashmir that they are only ruining their future and the future of all Kashmiris in the name of whether they call it azadi (independence), Islamic caliphate or Islam. You can take examples like Pakistan, Libya, Yemen or any country where such things are going. They have become the most violent places in the world. So, I want to see that it doesn't happen in India.""

The former IPS officer, who led the spy agency's ""Islamist Terrorism Desk"" between 2003 and 2005, was named on Monday to open talks in a bid to end the nearly three-decade-old insurgency in Kashmir.

When the IB was investigating the fledgling modules of the Islamic State in Kerala, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh in 2015, Sharma is widely known to have advocated a policy of arresting the problem by counselling and reforming, instead of arresting the potential recruits of the global terror network.

The soft-spoken intelligence veteran is known to have established friendly relationships with arrested militants in a bid to reform them when he was Assistant Director IB from 1992-94 - the time when militancy was at its peak in Jammu and Kashmir.

Serving in Kashmir as an IB man, Sharma was instrumental in the arrest of then Hizbul Mujahideen commander Master Ahsan Dar in 1993 after he broke away from Syed Salahuddin - the Hizb chief based in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

He recalled how he had met Dar in Srinagar jails and how the militant commander asked him to bring his daughter and son to meet him in the prison. ""I actually took them to meet him.""

Asked If he had identified the way to reach out to the youth in Kashmir, Sharma said he was still working out the modalities.

""I am open to talking to everybody. Anybody who believes in peace and wants to come and give me some ideas how to go about, I am willing to listen. He can be an ordinary student, ordinary youth, a rickshawwala or a thelawala with some good idea. I will consider that.""

He was asked if he had started reaching out to Hurriyat leaders, who have maintained silence over his appointment even though they had dropped hints in their statements about engaging in ""constructive"" talks with the government of India after some of their aides were arrested in terror funding case.

Sharma cautiously replied: ""Let me see. I am ready to talk to everybody. Anybody who wants to contribute to peace.""

Replying to a query that radicalisation of Kashmiri youth was a more recent phenomenon than the problem of Kashmir itself, Sharma said the state was almost at peace before the 2008 unrest over a land row and the 2016 wave of violent street protests after the killing of Burhan Wani.

""Somehow the minds of youths and students have been diverted somewhere else. That is the point of address. I have seen the violence in Kashmir from very close quarters. I was posted in Srinagar. So the kind of violence I have seen, I am really pained. I am very sad.""

Commenting on the previous attempts by the government of nominating peace emissaries and other initiatives to solve the problem, he said he would ""desperately like to try some new ideas"".

""I am studying the reports (of previous interlocutors) but other than that I am trying to see some new ideas.""

Kashmir is not Sharma's first assignment of brokering peace. In June this year, he was tasked to initiate a dialogue with insurgent groups in Assam, including the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) and those representing Bodos.

Asked over any difference between his previous peace brokering assignment and the new one, he said; ""The big difference is that there is not any involvement of Pakistan and any third country in the northeast.""","Even A Rickshaw-wala With A Good Idea Will Be Heard, Says Kashmir's New Interlocutor",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/28/even-a-rickshaw-wala-with-a-good-idea-will-be-heard-says-kashmirs-new-interlocutor_a_23259082/

Congress leader Ahmed Patel has rubbished as ""baseless"" the charge that he had any connection with a suspected terrorist who used to work at a hospital where he had been a trustee, and appealed to the leadership to not politicize matters of national security in poll-bound Gujarat.

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani last night demanded that Patel step down as Rajya Sabha MP. Though Patel had resigned as a trustee of the Sardar Patel Hospital in Ankleshwar town of Bharuch district in 2014, Rupani said he was still at the helm of the hospital's affairs and therefore owed an explanation as to how suspected ISIS terrorist Kasim Stimberwala earlier worked as a laboratory technician there.

""Patel must clarify how such a person got a job in his hospital and why he resigned just days ahead of his arrest.""

""Imagine what would have happened if these two terrorists were not arrested... Patel, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress must come clean on the issue. We also want Patel to resign as Rajya Sabha MP. It has now been revealed that Kasim had resigned just two days before he was arrested. This raises several questions. Patel must clarify how such a person got a job in his hospital and why he resigned just days ahead of his arrest,"" Rupani said at the BJP headquarters in Koba in Gandhinagar.

President Pranab Mukherjee was invited to inaugurate the premises in 2016, Rupani said, at a time when Stimberwala was still an employee.

Jayesh N Patel, a trustee of the hospital, told the Indian Express that ""Ahmed Patel or any of his family members are connected with the hospital and the trust in any away"".

The paper quoted a hospital statement as saying that ""The suspect resigned on October 4, 2017, voluntarily and was relieved from duty on October 24"".

Union minister Prakash Javadekar said Congress ""owes an explanation as to how a terrorist had been working there for so long"".

Patel tweeted: ""My party and I appreciate the ATS' effort to nab the two terrorists. I demand strict and speedy action against them. The allegations put forward by the BJP are completely baseless.""

""The BJP is being shown the door by 6.5 crore Gujaratis and a defeated BJP is clutching onto the polarising straws of blatant lies to reset the agenda. It will never succeed in its sinister conspiracies,"" the Congress leader said.

Après les multiples rebondissements autour de son décret anti-immigration, bloqué à plusieurs reprises, une juge fédérale américaine a bloqué, lundi 30 octobre, l'interdiction des transgenres dans l'armée, une décision annoncée par le président américain en juillet.

Donald Trump avait décidé de ne pas mettre en place une décision de Barack Obama intégrant les recrues transgenres dans l'armée. Au départ prévue pour le 1er juillet 2017, la nouveauté avait d'abord été repoussée au 1er janvier 2018 par l'administration Trump avant que celui-ci n'annonce finalement qu'il enterrait la décision.

La juge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, du tribunal de district de Washington, a ordonné lundi ""un retour au statu quo"", c'est-à-dire à la mise en oeuvre de la mesure emblématique de Barack Obama. Le jugement requiert un retour au mémorandum signé le 30 juin par le ministre de la Défense Jim Mattis pour tenir compte de cette nouvelle règle.

La décision de Trump ""soutenue par aucun fait concret""

Le président américain avait signé fin août un document ordonnant au Pentagone de ne plus recruter de personnes transgenres mais laissant au département de la Défense le soin de trancher les cas de ceux qui sont déjà enrôlés. Concrètement, il demandait au Pentagone ""de revenir à la politique et aux pratiques appliquées de longue date dans les forces armées au sujet des personnes transgenres"".

Le président américain avait défendu sa mesure en invoquant le budget: ""Notre armée doit se concentrer sur des victoires décisives et écrasantes et ne peut pas être entravée par les coûts médicaux énormes et les perturbations que les transgenres entraînent"", avait-il avancé. Dans son texte, il soulignait d'ailleurs que le Pentagone ne prendrait plus en charge les traitements médicaux des militaires transgenres travaillant déjà au sein de l'armée.

Cinq militaires transgenres avaient porté plainte contre Donald Trump et le Pentagone début août. Les cinq femmes dénonçaient notamment l'incertitude qui entourait leur avenir, expliquant notamment qu'elles ne savaient pas si elles conserveraient leur poste.

La juge leur a donné raison lundi, et a estimé que les raisons invoquées par le président américain pour interdire l'armée aux transgenres ""n'étaient soutenues par aucun fait concret"".

Police placed Dalit writer and social activist Kancha Ilaiah under house arrest here on Saturday to stop him from leaving for Vijayawada to address a public meeting.

Policemen were deployed outside his house in Tarnaka. A team from Andhra Pradesh has conveyed to him that he will be arrested if he steps out of the house.

A large number of Ilaiah's supporters gathered outside his house. One of the supporters said they were determined to leave for Vijayawada.

The police team on Friday served notice on the Dalit thinker, informing that there is no permission for the public meeting in Vijayawada as prohibitory orders were in force in the city.

Some Dalit and backward classes organisations had planned to organise to express solidarity with Ilaiah, facing threats from various groups from Arya Vysya community.

The Hyderabad High Court on Friday had refused to give directions to Andhra Pradesh Police not to grant permission to Ilaiah to conduct a meeting in Vijayawada. The court was hearing a petition filed by Arya Vysya Sangham.

Arya Vysya-Brahmana Aikya Vedika or the joint committee of Arya Vysya and Brahmin communities had threatened severe consequences if Ilaiah was allowed to visit Vijayawada and hold the meeting.

The joint committee had also planned to organise a meeting but dropped its plans after police imposed orders banning meetings and rallies in the city.

Ilaiah alleged that the governments of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were trying to suppress freedom of expression.

The writer has been facing protests from the Arya Vysya groups for describing the trading community as social smugglers in his Telugu book ""Samaajika smugglerlu komatollu"".

His community got the idea of turning volcanic steam into drinking water in the 1980s, from an overseas visitor.
Today over a thousand families in his village are using the volcanic steam water, he added.

GISHARU, Kenya -- On the edge of Mt. Suswa, an active volcano in southwest Kenya's Rift Valley, Kipas Ole Masiodo checks on volcanic steam rising from cracks in the ground, careful not to let any go to waste.

As prolonged drought dries water reserves across Kenya, harvesting these fleeting wisps of water vapour near Masiodo's home has been a lifeline for his family and community.

""It is clean and safe for drinking,"" the 35-year-old said. ""It is not much, but it is better than travelling to distant sources to look for water.""

Using aluminum sheets and a concrete tank, his community traps the steam, which when cooled can become drinking water. Masiodo said a single steam trap is able to collect at least 200 litres (53 gallons) of water every day – and his village now has 20 of the traps.

The community began building the structures seven years ago, with help from the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD), which donated 8 million Kenyan shillings (about $8,000) to the effort.

The result is that families no longer have to spend large amounts of time searching for scarce water. Previously, Masiodo said, his wife spent several days a week travelling 10 hours a day with the family donkey to fetch water from the distant Ewaso River.

""We are able to use time (otherwise) spent fetching water ... to raise money for school bursaries and build community enterprises like beekeeping,"" the father of five told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

His community got the idea of turning volcanic steam into drinking water in the 1980s, from an overseas visitor.

Although the visitor described the technology needed to harvest water, using iron sheets, it wasn't until 2009 that villagers had the money to put the idea into use.

Now the community has harvesting units, made with aluminum sheets and concrete, as well as collecting tanks ""to store water in large volumes,"" Masiodo said.

He said one unit costs about 200,000 Kenyan shillings (about $ 2,000) to build. Today over a thousand families in his village are using the volcanic steam water, he added.

FINDING AND STORING WATER

As droughts become more frequent in Kenya, many communities are looking for new sources of water and new ways to store it, from building new water ponds to creating sand dams in rivers to hold fresh water in wet sand.

But some water sources have struggled to keep up with demand, particularly during long droughts, said Ole Timoi, a programme manager for Dupoto-e-maa, a community-based organisation that works with pastoralist communities in the Rift Valley.

""Water pans collect and store water when the rain falls,"" said Timoi, whose organisation worked with CAFOD to set up the steam harvesting in Gisharu.

""The stored water can last up to three months before the next rainy season sets in. (But) if the rains fail, the water dries up and the stress cycle continues,"" he said.

Volcanic vapour, in comparison, can provide year-round water, regardless of rainfall – though so far many poor communities lack funding to harness the steam, Timoi said.

Tapping all of the vents around Mt. Suswa would cost more than $100,000, he said.

GEOTHERMAL ENERGY

Those hoping to use volcanic steam for water in Kenya more widely, however, face competition from another user: geothermal energy plants.

Kenya has built three geothermal plants to take advantage of natural steam energy in the area north of Mt. Suswa, giving the country a green and reliable energy source.

But ""marginalised communities need water more than they need electricity,"" insisted Timoi.

Wilson Irungu Nyakera, the Ministry of Planning's principal secretary, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that Kenya's government recognises the need to build more sustainable water infrastructure over the next decade to deal with changing climate conditions.

But budgetary restrictions mean the country will likely need donor funds and private investment to make that happen, he said.

For now, Masiodo is happy his village has reliable water, even in the face of drought. But he hopes more communities will be able to find the funding to put steam harvesting systems in place.

""If there was no water life would be very difficult,"" he noted.

As-tu l'impression de t'inscrire dans un courant d'auteurs en particulier?

Je me reconnais beaucoup dans la vague générationnelle entre 20 et 40 ans. On fait beaucoup d'autofiction, avec une certaine trashitude, un réel brut, de l'ironie, du sarcasme, de l'autodérision et une lucidité dans l'écriture. Même si on est tous différents, on est lié dans notre travail, avec nos préoccupations, nos intérêts et plusieurs thèmes qui se recoupent.

Comme tu donnes beaucoup dans l'autofiction, est-ce qu'on peut dire que Marianne est un peu la suite logique d'Ariane, le personnage en partie inspiré de toi dans ton premier roman In Between?

Oui. J'ai joué avec ça: Marie, Ariane, Marianne. Même si j'envisage Marianne comme un personnage détaché de moi, je me place au-dessus d'elle et je porte un regard critique sur ce qui se passe. Dans In Between, je me censurais un peu pour protéger mon entourage, étant donné que je parlais d'un sujet délicat: la famille. Mais dans Les désordres amoureux, je n'étais pas dans la volonté de protéger personne. Je voulais pousser l'autofiction au maximum et exposer les désastres amoureux dans ce qu'ils ont de plus laid: les relations qui ne fonctionnent pas, les catastrophes et les injustices qu'on vit en tant que femmes. J'avais l'impression d'en avoir vécues beaucoup. Mais je n'ai pas tout raconté. J'ai fait un tri et j'ai changé des affaires. Ce n'est pas du tout une biographie.

Quand on s'attarde au fond, on comprend à quel point les amours de Marianne sont désordonnées. Pourquoi désirais-tu aussi illustrer le désordre dans la forme avec une structure en pièces détachées?

J'ai de la misère à écrire de façon linéaire. J'aime donner un défi supplémentaire aux lecteurs en superposant des univers et des temporalités pour montrer l'avant, l'après et le maintenant. Je trouve ça intéressant de tout mélanger pour voir comment certains patterns restent et d'autres changent. C'est un peu comme quand tu vas chez le psy, tu ne pars pas du début en allant vers la fin. Tout va se mêler.

Pourquoi décris-tu cette histoire comme le roman de l'éternelle insatisfaction?

Marianne s'arrange pour ne jamais être satisfaite, et quand elle l'est, elle s'arrange pour ne pas aller au bout de sa satisfaction. Je trouve que c'est super caractéristique de notre génération. On est pris avec une espèce de quête éternelle de bonheur, tout en s'arrangeant pour ne pas le trouver ou pour le saboter quand on le trouve. Le roman met en lumière l'autosabotage de Marianne et ses éternels recommencements. Elle essaie avec plein de gars nouveaux, elle revient avec des ex et elle enchaîne les débuts, comme si l'aboutissement était effrayant. Elle veut faire de l'ordre dans sa vie et elle est consciente de ses bibittes, mais elle ne sait pas comment ne pas être elle-même.

Est-ce qu'elle croit en l'amour ou elle est convaincue que les histoires du «nous» durable ne sont que des «esties de menteries», comme tu l'écris?

Elle aime l'idée, mais dans la pratique, ça ne fonctionne pas pour elle et elle le sait. Je voulais montrer que les désordres amoureux sont en réalité un symptôme de son éternelle insatisfaction, qui se déploie dans plusieurs sphères de sa vie. Quand elle finit sa maîtrise, elle pète un plomb et elle ne profite pas du tout du moment où elle dépose son mémoire. Rien n'est jamais assez.

Peut-on tracer un parallèle entre son réflexe d'abandonner certains emplois sans avoir fourni tous les efforts nécessaires et sa recherche amoureuse bardée de critères qui n'aboutit pas parce que tout ne lui tombe pas tout cuit dans le bec?

Tout à fait. Notre génération s'est fait dire qu'elle pouvait tout faire, mais ce n'est pas ça la réalité. On a beaucoup d'obstacles financiers et on manque d'opportunités. À cause de ça, on a beaucoup d'attentes et à un moment donné, on a peur que ça n'aboutisse pas. Donc, au lieu de se faire rejeter par quelqu'un, on le laisse avant. C'est la même chose avec le travail. C'est plus une protection qu'une incapacité à fournir les efforts requis. Je trouve que notre génération travaille très fort, malgré le gros cliché des enfants qui ont eu tout cuit dans le bec.

Pourquoi c'est important de camper une partie de tes histoires à l'étranger?

Le recul du voyage est extrêmement éclairant. À l'étranger, tu vois où tu étais avant de partir et comment tu veux être en revenant. Et la situation permet à Marianne de vraiment goûter au moment présent et d'en être comblée, alors que le reste de son histoire expose le sentiment inverse. Aussi, la portion qui se déroule en Colombie est plus légère que ce qui se déroule à Montréal. Je voulais faire respirer le lecteur.

Quand elle débute son roman en Colombie, elle évoque son envie d'absolu et son désir de créer quelque chose d'immensément douloureux et de terriblement beau. Est-ce qu'on peut comparer sa volonté d'ébranler les lecteurs avec ses mots et son désir de troubler un homme en amour?

Ce qu'elle ne trouve pas dans sa vie amoureuse, elle voudrait que les lecteurs le ressentent d'elle. Je pourrais dire la même chose de moi, maintenant. Écrire, c'est une quête d'amour. Certains auteurs disent que c'est dont ben pas important la réception, mais ce n'est pas vrai. Moi, je carbure au bonhomme de 55 ans qui me dit qu'il a pleuré en lisant mon roman. C'est ça qui me fait vivre!

As-tu l'impression que ta plume est plus confiante?

J'en suis convaincue. Je suis en train de me trouver à travers mon style, qui est très singulier. Que les gens aiment ça ou non, ils savent qu'ils lisent du Marie Demers.

Steven T. Mnuchin, le Secrétaire américain au Trésor, a « exhorté le secteur privé à reconnaître le fait que les pasdaran infiltrent une grande partie de l'économie iranienne, et que ceux qui traitent avec des sociétés contrôlées par les pasdaran, le font à grands risques... »

Cette information a eu un écho considérable dans les médias du monde entier et a suscité une très grande colère en même temps que de vives inquiétudes des autorités de la dictature théocratique au pouvoir en Iran. Mais cela fait longtemps, près de quatre décennies, que le Corps des gardiens de la révolution islamique (CGRI/pasdaran) se trouve au cœur du bras de fer entre l'Iran des mollahs et la communauté internationale. Le nom de cette force paramilitaire redoutable a été mêlé à de nombreuses crises nationales, régionales et internationales.

Une force militaire pas comme les autres

Toute armée régulière classique a pour mission principale la défense du territoire nationale contre toute agression étrangère, mais le régime islamiste de Téhéran instauré par Khomeiny en 1979 s'est doté, en plus d'une armée régulière robuste et suffisamment équipée qu'il a hérité de l'ancien régime, un nouveau « bras armé » chargé de « protéger le système de la République islamique » et de sauvegarder « les acquis de la révolution islamique » selon l'article 150 de la Constitution.

C'est justement pour accomplir cette mission, à savoir la sauvegarde du régime islamiste du « Guide suprême » que le CGRI s'est employé à agir comme la garde prétorienne d'une dictature aux apparences religieuses.

De la répression de toute opposition ou dissidence politique intérieure et de la société iranienne dans son ensemble en recourant à toutes les méthodes imaginables pour semer la terreur, à l'exportation de l'idéologie Khomeyniste partout dans le monde musulman où il y a une opportunité, on peut voir la main des « pasdaran » ou les forces qu'ils ont créées.

Pour les chefs et membres de ce corps qui agissent sous le commandement direct du Guide suprême auquel ils sont liés par un serment d'allégeance et obéissance totale, tous les moyens sont bons pour atteindre leurs objectifs : une répression brutale à l'intérieur du pays, le terrorisme, actes de guerre, le financement de la violence ou encore incitation aux exactions contre les minorités ethniques ou religieuses dans le chaos du Moyen-Orient...

Le CGRI qui a créé un empire économique gigantesque unique au monde au prix d'appauvrissement de la population, est également chargé du développement du programme d'armes nucléaires et de missiles balistiques de longue portée. Pasdaran ont également leurs propres services de renseignements et de nombreux centres de détention.

La répression brutale du peuple iranien

La « République islamique » a été condamnée pour la violation aggravée des droits humains par 65 résolutions des Nations Unies depuis 35 ans : des milliers d'exécutions politiques, la pratique de la torture (174 méthodes révélées à ce jour), pendaisons publiques dont celles de femmes et de mineurs, l'absence des libertés fondamentales dont la liberté d'expression, de rassemblement, la répression des dissidents dont des journalistes, des blogueurs, des artistes, cinéastes[1]...

Les milices « Bassidji » [mobilisation populaire] créés depuis de nombreuses années sur ordre du Guide suprême par le CGRI, est une force de répression interne forte de plusieurs centaines de milliers d'hommes souvent très jeunes (20 à 30 ans) qui dépendent du commandement des pasdaran. Encadrés, formés et endoctrinés par les mollahs et les gardiens de la révolution, ils sont particulièrement violents lors de la répression des manifestations pacifiques contre le régime comme celles de juin 2009 à février 2010.

Ce soulèvement populaire plus tard connu sous le nom du « printemps perse », commencé d'abord pour dénoncer les fraudes électorales et pendant lequel des centaines de milliers d'hommes et femmes sont descendus dans les rues de Téhéran et d'autres grandes villes de pays, avait fini par viser le sommet du pouvoir du clergé aux cris de « mort au dictateur ! ». Ces manifestations pacifiques ont été réprimées dans le sang par ces miliciens, ainsi que par les Forces de sécurité de l'Etat (nirouy-e entezami) dont les chefs et principaux cadres sont également issus des rangs du CGRI. Ces derniers ont tiré directement sur les foules faisant des centaines de morts et de blessés. Les médias ont rapporté plus de 4000 personnes arrêtées, dont un nombre indéterminé, sûrement des dizaines ont succombé sous la torture notamment dans un sinistre centre de détention à Kahrizak...

Les exactions à l'étranger

La Force Qods du CGRI a la mission d'exporter « la Révolution » de Khomeiny. Pour cela elle recrute et forme des milices dont les exactions en Irak, Syrie et ailleurs sont dénoncées par des organisations des droits de l'Homme. D'après le rapport 2016-2017 d'Amnesty International sur l'Irak[2], ""Les milices majoritairement chiites se livrent à des violations, comme la disparition forcée et l'enlèvement de milliers d'hommes et de garçons majoritairement sunnites, la torture et les exécutions extrajudiciaires, ainsi que la destruction injustifiée de biens""...

Le rôle déstabilisateur du régime iranien au Moyen Orient n'est plus un secret pour personne. La colère contre la décision récente du président des Etats Unies d'avoir désigné les pasdaran comme une entité terroriste, a poussé même le Guide suprême Ali Khamenei à avouer ouvertement la présence et les activités du CGRI-FQ dans la région, « Les États-Unis sont en colère parce qu'aujourd'hui la République islamique d'Iran a contrarié leurs plans au Liban, en Syrie et en Irak », a-t-il déclaré le 18 octobre 2017.

Les autorités iraniennes l'accusent d'« activités contre la sécurité nationale » et de « propagande contre le régime » – des chefs d'accusation passibles de six ans de prison.

Il s'appelait Franz Josef Strauss... Il s'opposait frontalement, durement à la politique du pourtant très consensuel Helmut Schmidt... Mais il devait s'opposer en se déportant très loin sur la droite... Résultat, il n'a jamais gagné...

A entendre Laurent Wauquiez parler de la non incarnation de la France par Emmanuel Macron, on devinait derrière les critiques de la droite des années 30: ""la gauche cosmopolite, adossée à une certaine finance, -tiens tiens Emmanuel Macron a travaillé chez Rotschild, qui ne connait pas la réalité du pays""... Une autre version du fameux ""la terre ne ment pas"".

En réalité Laurent Wauquiez est en train de saborder l'héritage gaulliste pour retrouver celui de Pétain... Il prolonge en cela le travail idéologique initié par François Fillon et cela est une garantie d'échec pour la droite française.

Laurent Wauquiez se veut le chantre d'une France qui n'existe plus. Dans un pays où la concentration urbaine est une réalité, où les mariages mixtes sont plus fréquents qu'on ne le croit, où la tolérance pour l'homosexualité est partagée par bon nombre de familles, on ne peut pas trouver une majorité sur cette ligne politique là.

En France, y compris dans les régions les plus conservatrices, cette modification des schémas familiaux au sens large est une réalité qui pousse à la tolérance une grande partie de nos citoyens.

Certains, parfois, ne font que ""tolérer"" le cousin homosexuel et restent gênés par certaines revendications communautaristes, mais sans pour autant tomber dans l'homophobie la plus odieuse.

De même, la France de Sens commun n'a pas vocation à devenir majoritaire... Elle ne peut pas...

Pire, la violence de Laurent Wauquiez trahit le retour de la droite vers une certaine immaturité politique. L'une des plus grandes réussites de François Mitterrand et de Jacques Chirac est d'avoir montré que l'on pouvait avoir une alternance paisible, dans la durée.

Or dans la surenchère de Laurent Wauquiez, il y a à nouveau cette idée que seule la droite est légitime à gouverner... Une arrogance de classe qui aujourd'hui constitue une promesse évidente de défaites futures.

Si Laurent Wauquiez est ainsi condamné à des surenchères aussi dévastatrices, c'est d'abord parce qu'il peine à trouver un espace politique. En effet, comme naguère en Allemagne avec le chancelier Schmidt, le Président Macron occupe un espace central qui marginalise de fait Laurent Wauquiez. La droite qu'il prétend incarner ne peut en réalité s'opposer frontalement à une politique qui trouve l'assentiment du centre gauche et du centre droit...

Ensuite, la droite a pu prospérer dans sa critique de François Hollande sur un affaiblissement la fonction présidentielle. En renouant avec l'inconscient monarchique français, Le locataire actuel de l'Elysée offre peu de prises à toutes les formes d'opposition.... C'est là toute sa force... Laurent Wauquiez va peu à peu découvrir qu'Emmanuel Macron reste l'homme qu'on ne peut parvenir à détester, sans toutefois l'aimer... Pour une opposition politique, c'est sans doute là une bien mauvaise nouvelle

Und fürchte nicht der Feinde Spott,

Bekämpfe mutig die Verneinung,

So du den Glauben hast an Gott.

Theodor Fontane

Der Gnade bedürfen

Nun ist es soweit: 500 Jahre Reformation - oder besser: Von heute her gesehen begann mit dem 31. Oktober 1517 in Deutschland eine Entwicklung, die nicht nur zu einer weiteren innerchristlichen Konfession, dem Protestantismus, führte. Mit der Reformation wurden drei Themen auf die Tagesordnung zunächst des europäischen Lebens, dann auch global gesetzt: Freiheit, Bildung, Verantwortung. Sie bedürfen auch morgen der immer wieder neuen Durchdringung. Doch Ausgangspunkt für das reformatorische Wirken war eine tiefe Erkenntnis des Glaubens: Der Mensch bedarf der Gnade Gottes, um nicht an sich selbst zu verzweifeln. Diese kann er nicht selbst erzeugen. Sie ist ihm geschenkt durch Jesus Christus. Doch das, was mitten in dieser Welt greifbar nahe liegt, muss immer neu gesucht werden: die Erlösung. In dieses Suchen, vor allem in den Zuspruch der Erlösung, dürfen sich keine Institution, keine Hierarchie, kein Klerus und kein Papst beschönigend, beschwichtigend, Angst und abhängig machend zwischenschalten. Darum steht am Anfang jeder Zukunftsüberlegung zunächst die kritische Einschätzung des eigenen Lebens: die Buße. Sie ist aber nur dann mehr als eine sich selbst bemitleidende Zerknirschung, wenn sie in der Hoffnung auf Vergebung vollzogen wird: Nichts von dem, was mich jetzt noch von einem sinnerfüllten Leben abhält, also auch nichts von den Zerstörungskräften auf dieser Welt, hat vor Gott Bestand.

Spannungsbogen Freiheit und Bindung

In den Einsichten der Reformatoren lag so viel Sprengstoff, dass ihr Wirken zu Beginn des 16. Jahrhunderts in allen gesellschaftlichen Bereichen revolutionäre Umwälzungen auslösten. Menschen wurden aus selbstverschuldeter Unmündigkeit befreit und verlangten Teilhabe nicht zuletzt an Bildung, Arbeit, Einkommen. Menschen erkannten aber auch, dass all das, was der Glaube an Freiheit ermöglicht, vor Gott und den Menschen, also dem Nächsten, verantwortet werden muss. Der Spannungsbogen von Freiheit und Bindung darf nicht erstarren. Wenn und wo dies geschieht, verkümmert beides: Freiheit und Ordnung. In eine solche Krise geraten wir als einzelne Menschen wie als Institution täglich. Doch nicht nur Kirchen oder Christen stehen in der Gefahr zu verkrusten - auch andere gesellschaftliche Institutionen und Menschen mit keiner oder einer anderen religiösen Überzeugung. In diesem Sinn muss sich nicht nur die Kirche als eine pulsierende, den Geist der Freiheit atmende Institution erweisen, die durch das Wechselspiel von Buße und Umkehr den Aufbruch wagt. Diese Bewegung wird jeder und jedem abverlangt. Was wir aber ganz im Sinn Theodor Fontanes sagen können: Wer sich durch Gottes Geist antreiben lässt, der kann sich furchtlos und das Leben bejahend, auch genießend in dieser Welt bewegen. Das Ja Gottes zu meinem Leben überstrahlt allen Hang zur verneinenden Missmut. Genau das fasziniert bis heute viele Menschen am Auftreten eines Martin Luthers. Genau das macht Menschen wie Dietrich Bonhoeffer oder Martin Luther King zu Vorbildern des Glaubens.

Ängste nehmen

In diesem Sinn haben wir heute als Kirche zu wirken: Ängste nehmen und Menschen in ihrer so großen Unterschiedlichkeit und Vielfalt annehmen, zusammenführen und zu einem gemeinsamen Leben auf dieser Erde ermutigen. Im Protestantismus ist kein Platz für religiöse oder rassistische Ausgrenzung, für nationale und völkische Überheblichkeit und für gewalttätige Selbstbehauptung. Die einzige Grenze, die wir anerkennen, ist die des Todes - aber auch sie hat Jesus Christus überwunden. So beginnt alles Leben mit der Buße, der kritischen Betrachtung des Selbst: Ich bin wenig weniger als Gott (Psalm 8), aber keinesfalls mehr als der Nächste.",Gruß zum Reformationsfest 2017,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/christian-wolff/gru-zum-reformationsfest_b_18420956.html

Όπως έγινε γνωστό σήμερα από το ΓΕΑ, σε εξέλιξη βρίσκονται οι διαδικασίες για την εξεύρεση της «κάλλιστης» οικονομοτεχνικής μελέτης για τη δημιουργία σύγχρονου εκπαιδευτικού κέντρου στην 120 Πτέρυγα Εκπαιδεύσεως Αέρος. Αυτό θα περιλαμβάνει ποιοτική εκπαίδευση σε όλους τους τομείς, όπως εκπαίδευση εδάφους-αέρος, εκπαίδευση θαλάσσιας επιβίωσης στο σχολείο εκπαίδευσης θαλάσσιας επιβίωσης καθώς και εκπαίδευση στο σχολείο οργάνων, το οποίο θα μετεγκατασταθεί στη μονάδα από την 110 Πτέρυγα Μάχης.



Παράλληλα προωθείται η αναβάθμιση του Κέντρου Εκπαίδευσης Αεροπορικής Τακτικής (ΚΕΑΤ), σε πολυδύναμο κέντρο εκπαίδευσης με τη συμμετοχή ξένων χωρών και την παροχή υψηλού επιπέδου εκπαίδευσης, με δυνατότητα ολοκλήρωσης δύο ή τριών σειρών ανά έτος, ώστε να αποτελέσει ένα στρατηγικό εργαλείο επίτευξης εθνικών στόχων.



Στόχος της άσκησης «Ηνίοχος», την ευθύνη του σχεδιασμού της οποίας έχει το ΚΕΑΤ, είναι να γίνει η ανταγωνιστικότερη άσκηση στην Ευρώπη και στην ευρύτερη περιοχή της Μεσογείου.



Μάλιστα, στον Ηνίοχο 2018 θα συμπεριληφθούν και οι νέες εγκαταστάσεις του Σχολείου Όπλων Τακτικής. Αυτό θα δώσει την ευκαιρία στο ΚΕΑΤ να λειτουργήσει ως ενιαίο κέντρο και να στεγάσει σε σύγχρονες εγκαταστάσεις, όλες τις δραστηριότητες εκπαίδευσης και ασκήσεων, όπως αρμόζει σε ένα κέντρο που διεκδικεί το ρόλο του διεθνούς κέντρου επιχειρησιακής εκπαίδευσης.



Περαιτέρω, με ταχείς ρυθμούς προχωρά η αναδιοργάνωση μονάδων της πολεμικής αεροπορίας, μέσω της οποίας θα εξοικονομηθούν πόροι ύψους 15,6 εκατομμυρίων ευρώ. Όπως είναι γνωστό, έχει ψηφιστεί ο νόμος για τη συγχώνευση της σχολής Τεχνικών Υπαξιωματικών Αεροπορίας, της σχολής Ιπταμένων Ραδιοναυτίλων και της σχολής Υπαξιωματικών Διοικητικών, σε σχολή Μονίμων Υπαξιωματικών Αεροπορίας.

Trudeau refused Monday to address the letter directly, citing his ongoing respect for the office of the prime minister and its previous occupants.
What's more, Harper wrote, Canada has been too quick to reject American proposals, and has alienated the U.S. by insisting on negotiating alongside Mexico, and by promoting progressive priorities like labour, gender, aboriginal and environmental issues.
""I fear that the NAFTA re-negotiation is going very badly,"" Harper wrote in the Oct. 25 letter.

Trudeau refused Monday to address the letter directly, citing his ongoing respect for the office of the prime minister and its previous occupants. Instead, he delivered a familiar sales pitch on the current government's efforts to secure a better, more modern trade agreement.

""We have continually made the extremely strong case to the Americans about how important trade with Canada is, how many good jobs in the U.S. depend on trade with Canada, and how we are very much of the view that we can improve and modernize NAFTA in a way that can benefit all three of our countries,"" Trudeau told a news conference.

""We will continue to work diligently to stand up for Canadian interests while remaining constructive and firm around the negotiating table.""

Harper says Canada has alienated U.S.

Harper's letter excoriated the Liberal government for what he described as a cavalier approach to U.S. President Donald Trump, whom the former prime minister is convinced is not bluffing when he threatens to abandon the trade pact.

What's more, Harper wrote, Canada has been too quick to reject American proposals, and has alienated the U.S. by insisting on negotiating alongside Mexico, and by promoting progressive priorities like labour, gender, aboriginal and environmental issues.

""I fear that the NAFTA re-negotiation is going very badly,"" Harper wrote in the Oct. 25 letter.

""Canada's government needs to get its head around this reality: it does not matter whether current American proposals are worse than what we have now. What matters in evaluating them is whether it is worth having a trade agreement with the Americans or not.""

Trudeau refused to acknowledge the contents of the letter directly.

""I hold the office of prime minister in high regard, and because of that I hold former prime ministers in high regard, and will not make any comments on what he had to say.""

Canadian government officials have already dismissed the letter as a ""gift"" to U.S. negotiators, insisting that capitulating to U.S. demands at the NAFTA table would be a tactical error.

Jennifer Appel, Tasha Fuiava and their two dogs were rescued Wednesday by the crew of the USS Ashland, an amphibious dock landing ship based in Sasebo, Japan.

The women were spotted on Tuesday by a Taiwanese fishing vessel 900 miles southeast of Japan, according to Honolulu station KHON TV. Crew members contacted the Coast Guard in Guam. It then relayed the news to the USS Ashland, which was deployed in the area.

Appel and Fuiava set sail for Tahiti on May 23, but had an engine casualty amid bad weather a week into their voyage. Still, they continued on by sail.

In June, they began making daily distress calls, but had no luck getting the attention of ships for 98 days straight, according to The Guardian.

“It was very depressing and very hopeless, but it’s the only thing you can do, so you do what you can do,” Appel told reporters.

One night, a group of sharks attacked the boat and one shark returned a day later.

“Both of them, we actually thought it was lights out, and they were horrific,” Appel said. “We were just incredibly lucky that our hull was strong enough to withstand the onslaught.”

The two also dealt with the pain of seeing ships but not being able to make contact, Fuiava told NBC News.

“I could see light and I could see vessels, and once you get closer, we thought it would be close enough to do a [distress] call,” Fuiava said. “When they would turn and keep going, yeah, it was kind of sad.”

The ordeal ended Wednesday when the USS Ashland arrived on the scene around 10:30 a.m. Officials assessed the damage to the boat and found it unseaworthy.

The two women and their dogs were aboard the naval vessel by 1:18 p.m.

“I’m grateful for their service to our country. They saved our lives,” Appel said, according to a Navy press release. “The pride and smiles we had when we saw [U.S. Navy] on the horizon was pure relief.”

Appel and Fuiava were able to survive the five months of being stranded, thanks to water purifiers and a year’s worth of food they packed before sailing ― mostly dry goods like oatmeal, pasta and rice.

Once aboard the ship, Appel and Fuiava received medical assessments, food and a place to sleep. They will remain aboard the Ashland until the ship’s next port of call.

“The U.S. Navy is postured to assist any distressed mariner of any nationality during any type of situation,” Cmdr. Steven Wasson, Ashland commanding officer, said in the release.

Am Montag haben sich die Ereignisse in der Russland-Affäre des Weißen Hauses überschlagen

Die 5 wichtigsten Enthüllungen im Überblick

Es war still geworden. Über Wochen hatte sich in der Russland-Affäre des Weißen Haus wenig getan.

Dann überschlugen sich am Montag die Meldungen. Bereits am Wochenende hatte sich angekündigt, dass die ersten Anklagen für ehemalige und derzeitige Wahlkampf-Helfer von US-Präsident Donald Trump an diesem Tag erfolgen würden.

► Darum geht es: Mitgliedern des Trump-Teams wird vorgeworfen, sich illegal mit Personen aus Russland während des Wahlkampfes abgesprochen zu haben, um die Wahl zu manipulieren.

► Im Zentrum der aktuellen Entwicklungen stehen drei Personen: Trumps ehemaliger Wahlkampfchef, der Unternehmer und Lobbyist Paul Manafort, dessen Geschäftspartner Rick Gates und der Ex-Berater George Papadopoulos.

Während das Weiße Haus betont, die aktuellen Vorwürfe würden sich auf die Zeit vor dem Wahlkampf beziehen - was für Manafort und Gates stimmt -, wächst der Druck auf Trump dennoch. Die Russland-Ermittlungen könnten zur Gefahr für den Präsidenten werden.

Hier ein Überblick über die Ereignisse am Montag:

1. Zwölf schwere Anklagepunkte gegen Manafort und Gates

Wichtig festzuhalten ist: Die Anklageschrift des Sonderermittlers Robert Mueller gegen Manafort und Gates hat nichts mit Donald Trump und einer möglichen Zusammenarbeit seines Wahlkampf-Teams mit Russland zu tun.

Dennoch: Die Vorwürfe gegen die beiden Geschäftsmänner sind ernst.

Ihnen wird vorgeworfen, zwischen 206 und 2015 heimlich für ausländische Regierungen gearbeitet zu haben. Manafort und Gates sollen Lobbyarbeit in den USA für die Kreml-nahe Regierung von Wiktor Janukowitsch, zwischen 2010 bis 2014 Präsident in der Ukraine, betrieben haben.

Lobbyarbeit für ausländische Regierungen muss in den USA registriert werden. Meiden Personen bewusst die Registrierung, ist das Betrug - und kann mit einer Haftstrafe geahndet werden.

Weiter wird Manafort und Gates vorgeworfen, die Bezahlung ihrer Lobbyarbeit über im Ausland tätige Banken vertuscht zu haben. Dabei soll es sich um eine Summe um über 75 Millionen Dollar handeln.

Die Anklage von Mueller zählt auch auf, wofür Manafort das Geld ausgab: ein Leben im Luxus. 934,350 Dollar soll Manafort etwa in einem Geschäft für kunstvolle Teppiche in Virgina ausgegeben haben.

Einer der zwölf Anklagepunkte lautet zudem: ""Verschwörung gegen die USA"". Das muss nicht bedeuten, dass sich Manafort mit einer ausländischen Regierung verschworen hat. Vielmehr bedeute dieser Punkt, dass Manaforts und Gates Vergehen über herkömmliche Verbrechen hinausgingen, die gegen die US-Regierung gerichtet sind, erklärt das US-Politikwebseite ""Vox"".

Die Anklageschrift hat zunächst also wenig mit Donald Trump persönlich zu tun - sie wirft dennoch ein äußerst zweifelhaftes Licht auf sein Wahlkampf-Team.

2. Die dubiosen Personen in Trumps Umfeld

Denn mit der veröffentlichten Anklageschrift vom Montag wird deutlich, mit welch zwielichtigen Personen sich der Wahlkämpfer Trump umgab. Die Anklagepunkte zeichnen von Manafort das Bild eines korrupten Geschäftsmanns, der seit vielen Jahren russische Interesse vertritt.

Hinzukommt, dass Manafort zwischen März bis August 2016 als Wahlkampfleiter eine zentrale Rolle in der Kampagne von Donald Trump einnahm.

Da stellt sich die Frage: Was wusste Trump über Manaforts Vergangenheit? Der US-Sender CNN stellt zwei Thesen auf - und beide lassen Trump nicht gut aussehen:

► Trump wusste von Manaforts dubiosen Geschäften - und es war ihm egal.

► Oder er wusste nichts von dessen Vergangenheit, die laut CNN ein offenes Geheimnis ein Washington gewesen sei - und gab ihm trotzdem einen zentralen Posten in seinem Wahlkampf-Team.

Als Mitte August 2016 bekannt wurde, dass Manafort 12,7 Millionen Dollar auf illegalem Weg von Janukowitsch erhalten hatte, trat er als Wahlkampfleiter zurück.

Gates war noch länger Teil von Trumps Umfeld und soll weiterhin auch das Weiße Haus besucht haben.

Beide, Manafort und Gates, plädierten am Montag auf nicht schuldig. Ein Gericht ordnete am Montag Hausarrest für Manafort an.

Ein anderer Wahlkämpfer von Trump bekannte sich stattdessen schuldig.

3. Berater Papadopoulos bekennt sich zu Falschaussage

Wahlkampfberater George Papadopoulos hatte gegenüber dem FBI zugegeben, eine Falschaussage gemacht zu haben. Das wurde ebenfalls am Montag bekannt.

Papadopoulos hatte beim FBI falsche Angaben über den Zeitpunkt seines Kontaktes mit einem ausländischen Professor gemacht.

Aus Papadopoulos Schuldbekenntnis geht hervor, dass der Professor den Berater erst kontaktierte, nachdem Papadopoulos Teil des Trump-Teams war. Der Professor versprach demnach, ""Schmutz"" aus Russland gegen Trumps Rivalin Hillary Clinton liefern zu können.

Das Team von Donald Trump betont, dass Papadopoulos nur eine kleine Beraterrolle innegehabt habe.

Dennoch zeigt die Enthüllung vom Monta: Teile des Trump-Teams versuchten, schädliche Informationen gegen Clinton zu sammeln. Auch Trumps Sohn Donald Trump Jr. traf sich mit einer russischen Anwältin, nachdem ihm solche Informationen versprochen worden waren.

Und so könnte die Enthüllung über Papadopoulus noch zu einem ""größeren Problem für Trump als Manaforts Anklage"" werden, kommentiert der US-Sender CNN.

4. Wird sich Manafort gegen Trump wenden?

Wie gefährlich sind die aktuellen Entwicklungen für Trump selbst? Zunächst dürften die Ereignisse vom Montag keine unmittelbaren Auswirkungen auf den US-Präsidenten haben.

Allerdings besteht die Möglichkeit, dass sich Manafort gegen Trump wendet - um Schaden von sich abzuwenden. Das vermutet etwa der US-Rechtsexperte und ehemalige Bundesstaatsanwalt Renato Mariotti.

This is consistent with an early indictment to get Manafort to flip. https://t.co/GkyIb53UZ7 — Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) 30. Oktober 2017

Auch über Papadopoulos vermuten US-Medien, dass er bereits mit Sonderermittler Mueller zusammenarbeitet.

5. Mueller stochert tief

Und so bleibt die Gefahr, dass Trump womöglich über die Russland-Affäre stolpert. Die 31-seitige Anklageschrift gegen Manafort zeigt, wie gründlich Sonderermittler Mueller in der Sache vorgeht.

Der ehemalige FBI-Direktor hat dutzende Dokumente aus dem Weißen Haus und auch Finanzdokumente von Trump selbst angefordert.

Auch enge Trump-Vertraute stehen im Verdacht, ihre Fühler nach Russland ausgestreckt zu haben. Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner und Sohn Donald Jr. gerieten in die Schlagzeilen, nachdem bekannt geworden war, dass sie sich im Wahlkampf mit einer russischen Anwältin getroffen hatten - in der Hoffnung, belastende Informationen über Clinton zu erhalten.

Dieser Montag bedeutet einen großen Fortschritt in der Ermittlung von Mueller - der Tag macht aber auch deutlich, dass die Untersuchung noch lange nicht zu Ende ist. Die Russland-Affäre dürfte Trumps Präsidentschafts weiter überschatten.

Gefährlich wird es für Trump, wenn er versucht, den Schatten des Ermittlers loszuwerden. Sollte der Präsident Sonderermittler Mueller entlassen, könnte das als Behinderung der Justiz gewertet werden - und womöglich in einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren vor dem US-Kongress enden.

Je suis très reconnaissant de son excellent travail pour nous aider à être là où nous sommes aujourd'hui"", indiquait dans un communiqué le futur président Donald Trump.

La démission de celui qui était alors directeur de campagne du candidat républicain faisait suite aux révélations du New York Times quatre jours plus tôt. Le quotidien faisait état des liens troubles que l'intéressé entretenait avec l'ex-président ukrainien (et pro-russe) Viktor Ianoukovitch, sur fond de soupçons de corruption et de versements occultes, en marge de l'influence que Moscou entendait exercer sur Kiev. Montant des émoluments du conseiller: ""plusieurs dizaines de millions de dollars"", estime désormais la justice américaine.

Des révélations qui tombaient d'autant plus mal que les soupçons de complicité entre l'équipe de Donald Trump et la Russie étaient déjà forts. Plus d'un an plus tard, Paul Manafort, 68 ans, a été inculpé de ""complot contre les États-Unis"" ce lundi 30 octobre et assigné à résidence. Les autres chefs d'inculpation retenus contre lui, notamment ""blanchiment"", ""fausses déclarations"" et ""non déclarations de comptes détenus à l'étranger"", donnent un aperçu de l'image qui l'attend désormais outre-Atlantique (il a plaidé non coupable et rejette ces accusations).

Avant de tomber en disgrâce, ce lobbyiste reconnu a conseillé de nombreuses personnalités politiques, dont notamment un certain... Edouard Balladur.

L'ombre de l'affaire Karachi

Paul Manafort baigne depuis très longtemps dans la politique, toujours dans le camp républicain. De 1974 à 1980, il participe à la campagne de Gerald Ford, puis à celle de Ronald Reagan entre 1981 et 1984, avant de conseiller Georges Bush père et Bob Dole. En 1980, Paul Manafort avait cofondé un cabinet de lobbying politique: Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly (BMS & K), qui deviendra en 1996 BKSH & Associates. C'est notamment via cette entreprise qu'il commence les affaires avec l'homme d'affaires Donald Trump, dont il rejoindra l'équipe en mars 2016 avant de devenir son directeur de campagne en juin de la même année.

Fort de l'expérience glanée chez l'Oncle Sam, Paul Manafort offre ses services à l'étranger, notamment en France, où Edouard Balladur se sent pousser des ailes présidentielles (avant d'être éliminé dès le 1er tour en 1995). Et c'est à l'aune de l'affaire Karachi que son nom remonte à la surface. Deux contrats signés en 1994 avec le Pakistan et l'Arabie Saoudite sont soupçonnés d'avoir donné lieu à des rétro-commissions visant à financer la campagne d'Edouard Balladur, alors premier ministre.

Selon Mediapart, Paul Manafort est soupçonné d'avoir signé un faux contrat destiné à justifier une somme de 500.000 francs en espèces que Ziad Takieddine (homme d'affaires franco-libanais et intermédiaire dans ce dossier) ne parvenait pas à justifier à la douane. Paul Manafort a reconnu devant les juges avoir participé à titre de consultant à la campagne d'Edouard Balladur, en lui fournissant notamment des études d'opinion.

Devant les enquêteurs français en 2013, Paul Manafort a aussi affirmé avoir été payé par un intermédiaire dans cette campagne, l'homme d'affaires Abdul Rahmane El-Assir. Estimation de la somme perçue par le consultant entre 1994 et 2001 dans cette affaire: 340.000 dollars.

Club échangiste et ""lobby des tortionnaires""

Dans le CV de Paul Manafort, on trouve également les nombreuses affaires qu'il a réalisées avec plus plusieurs chefs d'États dans le monde. Parmi sa clientèle, l'ancien dictateur du Zaïre Mobutu Sese Seko ou encore l'ancien président philippin Ferdinand Marcos.

Des fréquentations qui vaudront à Paul Manafort d'être accusé, dans une enquête réalisée par l'organisation de journalistes d'investigation Center for Public Integrity, d'être à la tête d'un ""lobby des tortionnaires"".

Homme puissant, Paul Manafort a également été entendu en 1989 par les Chambre des représentants, dans le cadre d'une affaire dans laquelle il était accusé d'avoir joué de son influence afin d'obtenir un contrat immobilier à 43 millions de dollars.

Moins grave mais révélateur de sa réputation sulfureuse, le lobbyiste avait été épinglé en avril 2016 car il était abonné aux actualités d'un club échangiste et BDSM new-yorkais, et ce alors qu'il était déjà membre de l'équipe de campagne de Donald Trump. ""Make America Kinky (coquine NDLR) Again"", ironisait la presse outre-Atlantique.

You all hate the temperature in the office and your laughable company holiday schedule, but the constant complainer seems to take a distinct pleasure in ranting about it. If you need to shut them down so you can get back to work, Los Angeles-based therapist Amanda Stemen suggests offering solutions to problems the person brings up. Then, if the problem is legitimate and solvable, hopefully you’ll never have to hear about it again.

On the flip side, if it isn’t a legit problem, “the negative co-worker will usually stop complaining when they realize you’re a problem solver and not the type to indulge their behavior or listen,” she told HuffPost. “If the negativity continues, I remind my clients they can always make a quick escape by telling their co-worker, ’Sorry but I need to return to my work.”

When this high-level coworker leads your company’s quarterly meetings, you sit there stunned, thinking,“How, exactly, did this person get their title when others here are so much more deserving?” Issues involving under-performing superiors are among the most common complaints psychologist and executive coach Kate Snowise hears about it her office.

“This is the person in the office who spends most of their time keeping up the appearance of knowing what they are doing,” she said. “It might mean a lot of shuffling paper and smoke and mirrors, but many of them are very good at looking like they’re valuable.”

Her advice? Be respectful of the person while looking for effective, appropriate ways to work around them.

“Ask yourself: Is there another leader in the organization who you could use as an informal mentor? Or is there someone else that could help you navigate your frustrations or concerns?” she said. “If that doesn’t feel like an option, you can always sit tight. The incompetent superior typically self-combusts and in my experience, will either end up leaving or getting moved sideways.”

You can always count on this person to keep you clued in on the extracurricular activities of everyone in the office: your coworkers’ secret one-night stand, the new guy’s alcohol-filled Instagram feed. To curb their endless chatter and gain back your time, Southern California-based psychotherapist Tina Tessina recommends putting this coworker in “an adult time out.”

“Basically, retreat to polite, businesslike responses but be very low-key about disengaging,” she said. “If the person comes to your desk with gossip, say: ‘I’m sorry, I’ve got a deadline to meet.’ And keep on working. You don’t need to be friends with everyone in your office.”

It’s 8:45 on a Saturday night and you receive a work email from your manager when the request could clearly wait until Monday. The controlling behavior doesn’t end there ― they’re constantly asking for updates on projects and wanting to be CC’d on everything.

This behavior inevitably creates an atmosphere of distrust in your office and negatively impacts staff morale and productivity, said Alena Gerst, a psychotherapist based in New York City.

“Often, micromanagers are exhibiting a lack of trust but sometimes, they don’t even know they’re doing it,” Gerst said.

The best way to handle your office micromanager is to demonstrate, to your fullest ability, your competency. After all, you were hired or promoted for a reason.

“Don’t let your supervisor walk all over you, but show that you are thorough and trustworthy, and remind them verbally if need be, so they can learn to give you the room you need to do your job,” she said.

This colleague has a knack for sending tersely worded emails (sometimes, IN ALL CAPS to highlight the urgency of their request) and generally communicating in a way that leaves others feeling annoyed or hurt.

When dealing wiith a blunt communicator, Snowise recommends addressing them face-to-face whenever possible.

“Email, text and online messaging are apt for misinterpretation, and people often forget to add the niceties they would in a normal conversation,” she said. “So if you know you’re dealing with a blunt communicator, try and keep the majority of your communications face-to-face or over the phone.”

If you could leave Yelp reviews for people, you’d have this to say of the office slacker: “I would give this person zero stars!” Complaints about lazy colleagues are some of the most common and persistent, said Jose Sandoval, a psychologist in Miami, Florida. Unfortunately, the problem usually can be attributed to the complainer, too.

“Many clients complain but they often engage in self-sabotage by performing tasks that are beyond their job responsibilities to compensate for the slacker,” he told us. “I try to help people improve their assertive communication skills and usually recommend they seek a solution by involving someone at the administrative level, who may be able to delegate specific responsibilities.”

This coworker subtly ― or not so subtly ― takes credit for your work and oftentimes asks for your help and never reciprocates. Tessina’s advice for dealing with this and similarly jerky behavior?

There are 12 million South Sudanese. A third of them have had to run away from their own homes, either to neighbouring countries or to places within South Sudan itself. Why? Because of war.

Earlier this year famine was declared in part of Unity State to the north of Juba, only the second famine declaration in the world in the past 30 years. Half of the people are not getting enough to eat and almost two million are on the edge of famine.

Almost half the schools in the country cannot be used. They've been destroyed or else people have moved into them in the hopes of escaping the fighting.

Children play in a classroom which families use as a shelter to sleep in at night, on the grounds of St. Mary's cathedral, which is host to thousands of internally displaced persons, Wau, Western Bahr el Ghazal, South Sudan, Thursday, June 15, 2017.

UNICEF has done impressive work here — providing safe water, nutrition, health services, child protection services — but it must feel like you are pushing uphill. We have shifted our programming emphasis to make it more about immediate humanitarian relief, since long-term development cannot flourish in a situation like this. But we have to keep the long-term in mind, too, so that when this all ends we haven't just created dependency.

The protracted war has all but bankrupted the government, civil servants and police have not been paid since May, and everyone is on edge about another attack. And as the fighting continues and country sits on the brink of even more chaos, woman and children suffer more.

Going to Bentiu

The UNMISS (United Nations Mission in South Sudan) base in Juba is not too crowded in the morning — a group of peacekeepers run by doing some training; some people from Red Cross, some peacekeepers and UNICEF wait for flights. When I was here before, it was packed with people — tens of thousands of civilians had run into the UN compound for safety when the fighting started and were living here. Now it is less crowded because the civilians moved to a Protection of Civilians (PoC) location on the other side of the city.

We are heading up to Bentiu today. We make our way through the ramshackle waiting room. The children — Taniya and Franka (not their real names), sisters aged 15 and seven; and Peter, aged 10 — are happy and excited and nervous all at once as we sit and wait. ""Let's go,"" says Taniya the eldest, while the younger ones doodle in our notebooks. And soon enough we've walked across the tarmac, into the UN chopper and are on our way north.

Children gather around a United Nations armoured personnel carrier as they watch tensions between different communities build up following the escalation of a dispute involving young men in the Protection of Civilians (PoC) site in Bentiu, South Sudan, Sunday, April 30, 2017.

Bentiu is flat. The cars pick us up and take us to the UN compound and the Bentiu PoC, where people sought refuge when the fighting got too hard. The Bentiu PoC looks like a cross between a prisoner-of-war camp (with barbed wire fencing around the perimeter and watchtowers and strategic points along the fences and in the settlement too) and a refugee camp (tents; humble huts with plastic sheeting roofs, innumerable laneways and community latrines). The main difference from a prisoner-of-war camp is that here the barbed wire and the watchtowers keep the people inside safe from the armed groups outside. And these people aren't refugees in the legal sense, they are pastoral farmers who fled here for safety.

We go to the part of the PoC where the children's parents live. They get out of the car and then their parents are there, crying, hugging, laughing. The extended family and clan are there too, and soon women are dancing and singing and ululating. The children (who had changed into their best clothes before we got on the helicopter) are happy, but seem to be in shock as well. That figures. ""I never thought I would see my children again,"" says the girls' father. The children probably thought they'd never see their parents either. No wonder they are in shock.

When the violence comes everyone rushes away. ""In many villages,"" our child protection officer Soraia tells me, ""when parents heard armed groups were coming they would take their children to the river and load them in boats so they could go to safety."" I cannot imagine the level of desperation that would force you to make that choice, or the sense of despair that would follow.

Luny (name changed), 14, was recently released from an armed group in South Sudan. He's seen in the Protection of Civilians (POC) site near Bentiu, in Unity State, South Sudan on Aug. 13, 2016.

The violence has also caught children in other ways. Later, we met Edward, who had been kidnapped and forced into service with an armed group. After two years he managed to escape and return to his family here at the PoC. He is afraid to leave because he doesn't want to be kidnapped again. Edward is a young teenager. His voice hasn't broken yet. In Canada, he would be in Grade 9; here he has seen things no child — no person — should see. He will talk about his hopes of becoming a teacher; he will talk about wanting to learn; he will talk about telling other children not to be seduced into fighting by stories of valour and glory. But when we ask what life was like with the armed group, his words dry up. ""It was bad,"" is all he will say.

Mustafa, the lively and committed man who is in charge of UNICEF in Bentiu, is smiling when we leave the PoC. ""This is why we do our work. The big picture can look pretty bleak, and overcoming all the obstacles to get supplies here is tough, but seeing these children today, yeah, this is why we do our work.""

Όπως έγινε γνωστό σήμερα από το ΓΕΑ, σε εξέλιξη βρίσκονται οι διαδικασίες για την εξεύρεση της «κάλλιστης» οικονομοτεχνικής μελέτης για τη δημιουργία σύγχρονου εκπαιδευτικού κέντρου στην 120 Πτέρυγα Εκπαιδεύσεως Αέρος. Αυτό θα περιλαμβάνει ποιοτική εκπαίδευση σε όλους τους τομείς, όπως εκπαίδευση εδάφους-αέρος, εκπαίδευση θαλάσσιας επιβίωσης στο σχολείο εκπαίδευσης θαλάσσιας επιβίωσης καθώς και εκπαίδευση στο σχολείο οργάνων, το οποίο θα μετεγκατασταθεί στη μονάδα από την 110 Πτέρυγα Μάχης.



Παράλληλα προωθείται η αναβάθμιση του Κέντρου Εκπαίδευσης Αεροπορικής Τακτικής (ΚΕΑΤ), σε πολυδύναμο κέντρο εκπαίδευσης με τη συμμετοχή ξένων χωρών και την παροχή υψηλού επιπέδου εκπαίδευσης, με δυνατότητα ολοκλήρωσης δύο ή τριών σειρών ανά έτος, ώστε να αποτελέσει ένα στρατηγικό εργαλείο επίτευξης εθνικών στόχων.



Στόχος της άσκησης «Ηνίοχος», την ευθύνη του σχεδιασμού της οποίας έχει το ΚΕΑΤ, είναι να γίνει η ανταγωνιστικότερη άσκηση στην Ευρώπη και στην ευρύτερη περιοχή της Μεσογείου.



Μάλιστα, στον Ηνίοχο 2018 θα συμπεριληφθούν και οι νέες εγκαταστάσεις του Σχολείου Όπλων Τακτικής. Αυτό θα δώσει την ευκαιρία στο ΚΕΑΤ να λειτουργήσει ως ενιαίο κέντρο και να στεγάσει σε σύγχρονες εγκαταστάσεις, όλες τις δραστηριότητες εκπαίδευσης και ασκήσεων, όπως αρμόζει σε ένα κέντρο που διεκδικεί το ρόλο του διεθνούς κέντρου επιχειρησιακής εκπαίδευσης.

Der Schauspieler Anthony Rapp spricht im Interview mit ""Buzzfeed"" über einen Vorfall im Jahr 1986

Spacey hat sich inzwischen auf Twitter als schwul geoutet

Man kennt Kevin Spacey als mobbenden Chef in “Kill the Boss”, als betrügerischen Professor in “21” und natürlich als tyrannischen US-Präsidenten in der Serie “House of Cards”. Privat jedoch weiß man wenig über den Schauspieler.

Nun werden schwere Anschuldigungen gegen ihn laut: Der zweifache Oscargewinner soll 1986 einen 14-Jährigen sexuell belästigt haben.

Anthony Rapp, seinerseits Darsteller in der neuen Netflix-Serie “Star Trek Discovery”, berichtet im Interview mit ""Buzzfeed"", dass Spacey ihn auf einer Party hochgehoben und aufs Bett geworfen habe. Dann habe der ältere Branchenkollege sich auf ihn drauf gelegt.

Rapp: “Bin froh, dass nichts Schlimmeres passiert ist”

Bei Spaceys Anblick “dreht sich mir der Magen um”, sagt Rapp 30 Jahre später. “Es ist mir heute noch unbegreiflich, was damals passiert ist. Es verwirrt mich zutiefst.”

Die beiden Männer lernten sich auf einer After-Show-Party kennen. Der 14-jährige Rapp stand damals im Theaterstück “Precious Sons” am New Yorker Broadway auf der Bühne, Spacey in “Eines langen Tages Reise in die Nacht”. Die Theatergemeinschaft ist gut vernetzt. Man kennt sich, feiert zusammen Parties, tauscht sich aus.

Deshalb sei es ihm auch nicht seltsam vorgekommen, als der 26-jährige Spacey ihn zu einer Party in seiner Wohnung einlud, sagt Rapp gegenüber ""Buzzfeed"". Seine Mutter habe ihn manchmal auf Veranstaltungen begleitet; zu Spaceys Party jedoch ging der junge Mann alleine.

Weil er niemanden auf der Party kannte, habe er sich in Spaceys Schlafzimmer zurückgezogen und Fernsehen geschaut. Dann sei Spacey zu ihm ins Zimmer gekommen. “Erst in diesem Moment habe ich bemerkt, dass alle anderen Gäste gegangen waren”, so Rapp. Er habe sich aus Spaceys Umklammerung “herauswinden” können und die Wohnung verlassen.

“Je älter ich werde, desto mehr wird mir klar, dass ich froh sein kann, dass nichts schlimmeres passiert ist”, erzählt Rapp im Interview.

Spacey outet sich als schwul

Spacey hat inzwischen auf Twitter Stellung zu den Vorwürfen bezogen. Er schreibt, er könne sich an den Vorfall “ehrlich nicht erinnern”, räumt jedoch ein, dass es sich um “unangemessenes betrunkenes Verhalten” gehandelt haben müsse. “Wenn ich mich damals so verhalten habe, wie er es beschreibt, dann schulde ich ihm die aufrichtigste Entschuldigung” so Spacey.

Gleichzeitig nahm Spacey Rapps Anschuldigungen zum Anlass, sich als homosexuell zu outen. “Ich habe mein ganzes Leben über Beziehungen zu Männern und Frauen gehabt”, offenbart der “House of Cards”-Star. Nun habe er sich aber entschlossen, als schwuler Mann zu leben.

20.53 Uhr: Zweites Opfer des Herbststurms

""Herwart"" hat sein zweites Todesopfer in Deutschland gefordert. Auf dem Peenestrom in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern war am Sonntag ein Motorboot mit drei Urlaubern aus Sachsen gekentert. Eine ins Krankenhaus gebrachte Frau starb inzwischen, wie ein Polizeisprecher in Neubrandenburg am Abend mitteilte.

Rettungskräfte hatten die Frau und einen Mann in der Nähe von Wolgast zunächst bergen können. Die beiden waren trotz Sturmwarnung auf den Peenestrom, der zur Ostsee führt, hinausgefahren. Die Suche nach einem dritten Passagier blieb nach Angaben der Beamten auch nach rund fünf Stunden erfolglos.

13.57 Uhr: Camper von Sturmflut überrascht und ertrunken

Ein 63-Jähriger ist am Ufer des Jadebusens (Niedersachsen) von der Sturmflut überrascht worden und ertrunken.

Der Mann habe den Ermittlungen zufolge mit seinem Bruder auf einem Campingplatz am Strandbad Sehestedt in einem Bulli übernachten und sich beim Herannahen des Wassers zu Fuß in Sicherheit bringen wollen, teilte die Polizei am Sonntag mit.

13:33 Uhr: Bahn nimmt Fernverkehr erst wieder am Montag auf

Sturm ""Herwart"" hat auf den Strecken der Deutschen Bahn im Norden und Osten für erhebliche Schäden gesorgt.

""Derzeit sind die Städte Hamburg, Bremen, Kiel, Hannover und Berlin nicht mit Fernverkehrszügen zu erreichen"", teilte die Bahn mit. Der Fernverkehr könne erst am Montag wieder aufgenommen werden.

11:06 Uhr: Airbus 380 landet außerplanmäßig in Stuttgart

Wegen starker Windböen in Frankfurt musste am Sonntag ein Airbus A380 der Lufthansa außerplanmäßig in Stuttgart landen.

Nachdem die aus Houston (USA) kommende Maschine einige Zeit über dem Flughafen Frankfurt gekreist war, entschied sich der Kapitän zur Sicherheitslandung in der baden-württembergischen Landeshauptstadt, auch weil Treibstoff knapp wurde.

Der SWR hatte zunächst darüber berichtet. Ein Sprecher des Flughafens Stuttgart sagte, das Flugzeug sei sicher gelandet. Ein Sprecher der Lufthansa bestätigte das ebenfalls.

9:48 Uhr: Feuerwehr fährt 550 Sturm-Einsätze in Hamburg

Etwa 550 Mal ist die Hamburger Feuerwehr ausgerückt. Mittlerweile würden die Orkanböen nachlassen, was die Einsätze der Feuerwehr erheblich erleichtere, sagte ein Feuerwehrsprecher. Verletzt wurde bislang niemand, erklärte ein Polizeisprecher.

Auch in den Kreisen Pinneberg, Dithmarschen und Steinburg kam die Feuerwehr laut einer Mitteilung bisher auf insgesamt 230 Einsätze. Der Sturm habe zahlreiche Bäume auf Straßen, Wege, Fahrzeuge und Häuser gekippt.

7:54 Uhr: Bahn stellt Zugverkehr wegen Sturms großflächig ein

Die Deutsche Bahn hat ihren Zugverkehr am Sonntagmorgen in weiten Teilen Deutschlands eingestellt.

Wegen des Sturmtiefs «Herwart» führen derzeit keine Züge mehr in Nord- und Mitteldeutschland, teilte ein Bahnsprecher am Morgen in Berlin mit.

Betroffen seien die Strecken in den Bundesländern Schleswig-Holstein, Niedersachsen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt und Thüringen. Züge aus anderen Regionen in diese Gebiete endeten vorzeitig.

There are approximately 41,000 new cases of bowel cancer diagnosed every year in the UK, according to Cancer Research UK, but that number only makes up 11% of the overall number of patients living with the disease. Often detected late, at which point it can be fatal, and with the prognosis for 43% of patients not surviving ten years after their diagnosis, it is essential to develop more efficient methods of diagnosis. The new endoscopic system, presented at the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) conference in Barcelona, has already been tested in a clinical setting during the routine colonoscopy of 250 men and women.

It works by using a highly-detailed magnified image- 500 times the naked eye - of a colorectal polyp (a small clump of cells that forms on the lining of the colon), some of which can develop into colon cancer. The system then compares over 300 features of that image against a catalogue of over 30,000 endocytoscopic images allowing it to predict the lesion pathology in less than one second. Dr Yuichi Mori from Showa University in Yokohama, said: “The most remarkable breakthrough with this system is that artificial intelligence enables real-time optical biopsy of colorectal polyps during colonoscopy, regardless of the endoscopists’ skill.” Overall, 306 polyps were assessed real-time by using the AI-assisted system, providing a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 79%, and accuracy of 86%. Not only is it accurate, but it also prevents the unnecessary removal of non-cancerous polyps, according to Dr Mori. The NHS says bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer. The three main symptoms are persistent blood in the stools, change in your bowel habit and a persistent lower abdominal (stomach) pain, bloating or discomfort.",AI Can Detect Bowel Cancer In Less Than A Second,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ai-can-detect-bowel-cancer-in-less-than-a-second_uk_59f6f3d1e4b07fdc5fbf2f39

""Nothing"" was the answer for almost seven per cent of poll respondents.

Yes, nothing.

Illness came in as the No. 1 boogeyman with 9.4 per cent saying it was their biggest fear.

Financial woes and death tied for second place, with 8.2 per cent of respondents citing the two as their the biggest fear. Can we get a hell yeah for the free market?

Other slightly less, shall we say, universal fears such as ""bad candy"" and the Trudeau government were also mentioned, but ""none of these appear to be as prevalent in Canada as fearlessness,"" ARI said in a release.

Check out the full list here.

The poll's main focus was on Canadians' attitudes toward Halloween and trick-or-treating.

ARI found that there are ""decreasing concerns"" around children's safety on Halloween compared to previous decades.

In a 1989 Gallup Canada poll, for example, 21 per cent of respondents said it was ""as safe"" for kids to go out trick-or-treating as it was a decade prior. In ARI's 2017 survey, 52 per cent said it was as safe to go out as it was 10 years ago.

The poll also found that millennials were ""much more lenient"" when it came to the question of which age trick-or-treating careers came to an end.

Four-in-ten respondents in the 18-34 demographic said age 15 was the right time to stop. Those 55 and older, meanwhile, said trick-or-treaters should give it up at 12.

The Angus Reid Institute's poll was conducted online between Oct. 24-27 among a representative randomized sample of 1,504 Canadian adults. For comparison purposes, a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20.

It seems sport is not as exciting as it used to be. At least for some.

It used to be the spectacular marks, the improbable comebacks and the extraordinary moments of athletic genius that kept us all enthralled. And to a certain extent it still is. But there's a new generation of sport fans who are engaging with another dimension of sport that online gambling has brought about.

They're turning to the most enticing odds, the exotic bets and the best bet of the day. For them, gambling makes sport more fun, at least more interactive.

Gambling and horse racing have always gone hand in hand. Between August and the end of the Spring Carnival it's expected that Aussie gamblers will splash around $1.5 billion in bets. We'll drop around $140 million on the Melbourne Cupalone.

But now, it would seem, more and more sports are becoming linked with having a bet.

The theory is, if you have a financial stake in the game, the game is more exciting.

In 2014-15, Australians gambled nearly $7.2 billion on sports betting (not including racing), in the process losing around $815 million.

Alliance for Gambling Reform spokesperson Tim Costello has noted that ""sports betting is the fastest growing level of addiction"" in Australia and that ""sports betting targets young men and that's a rapidly growing area of addiction"".

Costello is not alone. A lot of people reckon sports gambling is out of control and wonder why it's even necessary. Surely the games themselves are entertaining enough, right?

Wrong.

For many, gambling has become an enjoyable, exciting and exhilarating part of their sport experience. They are no longer simply satisfied with sport -- they want to add to the entertainment value of it by gambling on it.

The theory is, if you have a financial stake in the game, the game is more exciting. If you bet on outcomes within games, like who'll have the most disposals or kick the first goal, there are more exciting parts within the game. It adds a bit of spice to the contest.

For millennials, in particular, it's right up their alley. Statistics show that 90 percent of those who gamble on sport online are male, with an average age of 31. They like to multi-task, so they'll gamble while watching sport. They like whatever they do to be convenient, such as placing a bet through an app on their phone. They like instant gratification and ongoing excitement, so they'll place exotic bets on outcomes during games. And they like to add to things to generate more entertainment value, so they'll gamble on the outcome of just about anything.

For them, a $20 wager on the outcome of a match is akin to a $20 investment in being entertained. They reckon its good value for money. It's part of their typical sports experience and they see nothing wrong with it at all.

Furthermore, of those I know, they argue they only spend what they can afford and bemoan the idea that betting on sport is naturally problematic. It's only problematic, they say, when you're spending more than you should.

Of course, sports betting companies know they're on to a winner here, and so do most sports organisations.

Most sports organisations peddle the socially responsible line that consumers should always gamble responsibly, but they also count the dollars gambling companies directly and indirectly generate for the game.

And that's exactly why, like it or not, sports have been willing participants in the integration of gambling and sport. They know that some fans are only watching their games because they've had a bet on the outcome. If they were to lose that audience, they'd take a financial hit.

That's why it's different from other forms of sponsorship from so-called socially irresponsible industries. Tobacco companies were banned from sponsoring Australian sport in 1992, but while fans could smoke at matches, it never became ingrained in the entertainment experience of sport. So, it was relatively easy for sports organisations to cut off tobacco companies. Not so with gambling.

In reality, the debate is one that fundamentally starts and stops with money, or more to the point, the pursuit of it and the devastating effects of losing too much of it for individuals who can't afford it.

But don't assume that those who lose on the punt do so expecting to win. For many, it's less to do with making money than it is investing in entertainment, because for them, believe it or not, gambling makes sport more fun.",Why Sport Can No Longer Exist Without Gambling,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/sam-duncan/why-sport-can-no-longer-exist-without-gambling_a_23257805/

La question serait plutôt de savoir alors comment se fait-il que nous captions certaines idées et pas d'autres? Pourquoi retenons-nous certaines idées et pas d'autres? Pourquoi actons-nous sur certaines idées et pas d'autres?

1. Le plus compliqué avec les idées c'est d'être en mesure de pouvoir les ""capter"" lorsqu'elles arrivent, lorsqu'elles frappent à votre porte

Selon certaines études scientifiques, nous avons environ 60.000 pensées par jour, dont plus de 95% sont répétitives et 80% sont négatives... Autant vous dire que si votre esprit est encombré comme cela, il vous sera plus difficile de capter vos idées! Mon activité me demandant d'être très créative, je n'hésite donc pas à m'octroyer des temps de pause dans la nature et de méditation durant ma journée car je sais que cela va me permettre de prendre du recul par rapport à mes pensées et pouvoir mieux être réceptive à mes idées.

2. Toutes les idées ne sont pas pour autant bonnes à suivre

Après les avoir captées, je prends le temps de discerner celles qui 'valent le coup' pour pouvoir décider de les suivre ou pas. Cette étape peut parfois paraître très confuse. Avant je n'aurais écouté que mon mental, mais je me suis rendue compte qu'il n'était juste que le porte-parole de mes peurs. Ces peurs qui pour me protéger, telles une maman hyperprotective, préféreraient me voir rester dans ma zone de confort et surtout ne pas prendre de risques! Or, vous savez comme moi, que la magie opère lorsque nous sortons de notre zone de confort. Aussi, j'ai pris conscience que j'avais d'autres ""indicateurs"" qui étaient plus bénéfiques pour moi d'écouter! Il s'agît de mes ressentis. Comment je me sens par rapport à cette idée?

Par exemple, si je n'avais écouté que mon mental – et donc mes peurs - je n'aurais jamais lancé le ""Sommet Francophone des Entrepreneurs de leur Vie"". Lorsque j'ai réussi à capter cette idée (je me rappelle très bien du moment où j'ai eu cette idée d'ailleurs), voilà ce que cela donnait côté mental: ""C'est énorme à monter"", ""tu ne sais même pas comment faire"", ""cela demande des moyens financiers que tu n'as pas"", ""cela demande des compétences techniques que tu n'as pas"", ""qui es-tu pour te lancer ainsi sur un sommet"", et ""aucun conférencier ne voudra s'associer à toi"" etc. Bref, vous voyez ce que je veux dire... Cette idée semblait plutôt bien partie pour aller aux oubliettes, à la poubelle pleine des ""bonnes-idées-que-nous-n'avons-malheureusement-pas-eu-le-courage-de-suivre"".

Mais au plus profond de moi je ressentais quelque chose de différent, quelque-chose de bien plus grand. Là, dans cet instant, pour moi la réponse a été nette: je SAVAIS au plus profond de moi. Point. Je SAVAIS que c'était ce que j'avais à faire et rien d'autres. Je ne savais pas comment je le ferai ni avec qui, mais je SAVAIS que c'était ce que j'avais à faire.

Je me rappelle très bien ce que je ressentais à ce moment-là, et ce que je ressens toujours même dans mes moments de doute et de peurs: cette certitude, ce calme intérieur, cette plénitude, cette foi en mon idée, et en même temps cette énergie nouvelle, cette vibration, cette JOIE: cette idée m'a littéralement mise en joie! Alors je savais ce que ce signal signifiait: c'est CELA que j'ai à faire. Et je l'ai bien mémorisé ce ressenti, car c'est un bel ancrage que j'utilise notamment lors de mes moments de doutes et de peurs!

3. Il ne suffit pas d'avoir fait le choix!

Il convient aussi de poser le premier acte au plus vite pour ne perdre le ""momentum"", cet élan créatif et résolument tourné dans l'action qui nous pousse! Alors pour éviter d'être à nouveau à la merci de mes peurs face à l' ""énooooormité"" (mon mental a tendance à l'exagération voyez-vous!) de la tâche à accomplir, ma stratégie c'est d'écrire la plus petite action que je peux poser dès maintenant. Puis la suivante. Et encore la suivante. Etre claire par rapport à ma vision et l'écrire c'est super, mais parfois cela peut me paralyser tellement cela me fait peur! Alors dans ces moments-là, réduire mon champ de vision et rester focalisée sur la toute première étape à franchir peut m'aider à dépasser mes peurs, puis la suivante, et ainsi de suite.

Un pas après l'autre... et avoir la foi et le courage de continuer ainsi... Alors je ne dis pas pour autant que c'est tous les jours facile. Comment cela se manifeste au quotidien pour moi depuis que j'ai eu cette idée ? Cela oscille entre l'excitation et la peur, entre l'envie de sauter de joie et l'envie de rester planquée sous ma couette! Bref c'est intense, mais c'est ce qui me rend vivante! N'est-ce pas justement cela la vie ?

A votre tour!

Que ""faites*""-vous pour être en mesure de réceptionner vos idées ?

Lorsque vous avez une idée, comment savez-vous si c'est une idée à suivre ou au contraire à laisser de côté?

Quelles sont vos stratégies pour continuer à suivre votre idée malgré vos peurs et vos doutes ?

N'hésitez pas à commenter, #partagerpourinspirer, et aimer cet article!

* au final ce n'est pas tant de ""faire"" quelque-chose mais plutôt d' ""être""....

On Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time with Bill Maher,” the star of the upcoming Lyndon B. Johnson biopic “LBJ” explained how he was invited along to a 2002 dinner with the future president by retired pro-wrestler Jesse Ventura.

Trump was trying to convince Ventura to be his running mate on the 2004 Democratic presidential ticket, said Harrelson.

The meal itself was “brutal,” Harrelson told the show’s host, Bill Maher. “I never met a more narcissistic man. He talked about himself the whole time. You could see the standard he was going to bear.”

The men are refusing to leave the centre at the Lombrum Navy Base despite its planned closure on Tuesday amid fears they won't be safe at three other facilities they are meant to relocate to in and around the island's main town of Lorengau.

Many locals in the town have threatened to use violence to stop the asylum seekers relocating, prompting Papua New Guinea authorities to deploy extra police to the island.

Meanwhile dining facilities at Lombrum have closed, with the asylum seekers now relying on basic food parcels containing museli bars, muffins, cornflakes and pre-cooked meals they've been told will last two days.

Power and water are due to be cut off on Tuesday ahead of PNG's navy retaking control of the site a day later.

Australia is trying to create violence in Manus. Its not the first time they've done that, some politicians benefit when there's violence. — Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) October 29, 2017

The Human Rights Law Centre's legal advocacy director Daniel Webb says the situation on Manus is ""like a powder keg"".

""There are people who are tense and they are frightened,"" he told AAP on Sunday.

""The refugees are terrified of violence if they stay inside the detention centre and if they leave.

""Many local people are angry, particularly at the Australian government, so it's a disaster waiting to happen.""

Anger has been building among locals at Lorengau over a lack of consultation about the facility to house some of the asylum seekers in a residential area on the town's outskirts.

Governor of Manus Island Charlie Benjamin has warned that many locals feared they would be in danger and were threatening to arm themselves with knives and other weapons to stop any of the 600 men moving in.

Australia expects the Lombrum centre will close as planned.

""Everything is proceeding at this point,"" a spokesman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told AAP.

Immigration Department Secretary Michael Pezzullo told a Senate committee last week that it was a matter for the PNG government to decide whether the men would be removed by force.

Refugee Action Coalition's Ian Rintoul fears a siege situation could develop at the Lombrum centre ahead of Tuesday's deadline.

""There are some indications that locals would attempt to get food and water to them but it's on a (naval) base so that will mean some kind of confrontation one way or the other,"" he told AAP.

Mr Rintoul said two of the three centres earmarked for the asylum seekers were still not fenced or guarded, raising concerns about their safety.

Some, such as professional birth photography and eating your own placenta, are relatively harmless.

But experts are now warning that vaginal seeding, where an infant born by caesarean section is swabbed with fluids from a mother's vagina, could pass potentially-dangerous bacteria and illnesses such as sexually transmitted infections to the newborn.

The very real risks outweigh the potential benefits. Dr. Christopher Zahn

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released new guidelines this week cautioning against the practice.

""Understandably, patients who may need to undergo a C-section are increasingly seeking counsel from ob-gyns on whether vaginal seeding is appropriate,"" Christopher Zahn, M.D., vice president of Practice Activities for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement.

""However, due to the lack of sufficient data, the very real risks outweigh the potential benefits. By swabbing an infant's mouth, nose or skin with vaginal fluid after birth, the mother could potentially, and unknowingly, pass on disease-causing bacteria or viruses.""

C-Sections In Canada

In Canada, 27 per cent of births were by C-section in 2013, according to the Canadian Institute For Health Information.

The rate is higher in older moms, with one Ontario study finding that 43 per cent of women over age 40 gave birth by C-section. Older women are more likely to face complications that could result in the need for a C-section, the National Post reports, but something called ""precious baby"" syndrome also plays a role.

""You've either tried a long time to get pregnant, or you've had IVF and finally you get pregnant and you say, 'I can't take any chances, I'm going to have a cesarean section,'"" Dr. Michael Klein, a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia and senior scientist emeritus at the Child and Family Research Institute, told the National Post.

Why Is Vaginal Seeding Popular?

A baby born by C-section isn't exposed to the same birth canal bacteria that a vaginal birth provides.

""The bacteria present in breast milk & on the nipple is sufficient for natural colonization or seeding of the gut."" https://t.co/TiVDStagdj — ACOG News (@acognews) October 25, 2017

The thought is that ""seeding"" this bacteria — usually by swiping a cotton swab with the mother's vaginal fluids on it against the baby's mouth, nose or skin — would expose the infant to bacteria that could help protect it from developing asthma, atopic disease, and immune disorders, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said.

But the research doesn't yet outweigh the potential risks, Zahn said.

""Breastfeeding for the first six months is the best way to overcome the lack of exposure to maternal vaginal flora at birth,"" he added.

Wer auf so einem Bücherstapel sitzt, sollte sie schleunigst zurückbringen

Wer nach Mahnung eins noch immer nicht sein Buch in die Bücherei zurück trägt, erhält weitere Mahnungen. Und damit wird es immer teurer. Mit der dritten und vierten Mahnung müssen die Studenten in München und Nürnberg 25 Euro bzw. 35,50 Euro zahlen. Mit den zehn Euro aus der zweiten Mahnung kommen so am Ende 78 Euro zustande. Nicht schlecht - dürften die meisten Bücher im Verkaufspreis doch deutlich darunter liegen.

Einziger Wermutstropfen: An besagten Hochschulen ist es egal, ob man ein oder 10 Bücher entliehen hat. In Frankfurt ist das anders: Hier kostet die erste Mahnung zwar nur drei Euro. Allerdings auch für jedes entliehene Medium. Wer also drei Bücher bei sich hortet, zahlt bereits neun Euro.

An Hamburg und Dresdens Universitätsbibliotheken kommen vergessliche Studenten übrigens am günstigsten weg. Nur einen Euro wollen die Bibliothekare hier pro Buch mit der ersten Mahnung.

Ein ganz eigenes System der Säumnisgebühren hat die Universitätsbibliothek in Leipzig. Hier werden einfach 50 Cent pro Tag verlangt, ab dem 10. Tag einen Euro. Nicht mehr jedoch als 25 Euro insgesamt. Dabei bietet Leipzig neben dieser speziellen Regelung auch noch eine Bibliothek, die 24 Stunden geöffnet ist. Ganz fleißige Studenten können hier sogar an Weihnachten und Silvester lernen, der ""Gute Rutsch"" kann dann wohl nur geflüstert werden.

Und in Berlin? Hier gibt es allein zwischen den drei Unis große Unterschiede. Die FU Berlin mag mit der ersten Mahnung 1,50 Euro haben, die HU und die TU bereits 2 Euro. Zweite Mahnung: Vier Euro an der FU, fünf Euro an den beiden anderen. Am günstigsten kommen Studenten an der TU weg, wenn die dritte Mahnung zur Türe hinein fliegt: acht Euro. FU, 11,50 und HU, 13 Euro sind da deutlich teurer.

Egal ob günstig oder teuer: Mahngebühren sind immer Kosten, die man sich sparen sollte. Wer also noch ein Buch bei sich rumliegen hat: Ab damit in die Bib. Mit jedem weiteren Tag wird die ohnehin schmale Börse noch weiter unnötig belastet.

A prominent JNU professor and a vocal critic of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been asked to explain by the government why he called the Narendra Modi-helmed ruling party ""anti-Muslim"" and referred to the Gujarat riots deaths as ""genocide"".

The complaint was filed against Professor Kamal Mitra Chenoy for criticizing BJP and Modi on Al Jazeera TV, by Satyapal Singh, a former Police Commissioner of Mumbai who later went on to become a BJP Lok Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh. Singh accused Chenoy of making anti-India comments.

A report by the Telegraph said Chenoy agreed that he had criticised the BJP and Modi and cited his freedom of speech to do so. He questioned why Modi did not visit Palestine on his trip to Israel.

In July, Singh filed the complaint with parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar who then forwarded it to HRD minister Prakash Javadekar. It was then sent to JNU registrar Pramod Kumar and Chenoy was asked to explain why he said what he did, according to the paper.

Chenoy is a supporter of the Aam Aadmi Party and had campaigned in Varanasi against Modi during the 2014 elections. He had also been vocal against central schemes, including Aadhaar.

""For quite some time activists have been increasingly worried about the growing linkage of the Aadhaar card with several other documents from bank cheques, ration cards, MGNREGA cards, bank accounts, generally the most important document for documentation, and so on. It has become the Indian document par excellence for identification.

""Activists including Jean Dreze, Reetika Khera, Aruna Roy have questioned the staggering validity and reach of the Aadhaar, and the possible misuse for a large variety of purposes. In the privacy judgement of the Supreme Court this aspect was not raised,"" he wrote for The Citizen in a column titled, 'Need for Sudhaar Not Aadhaar'.

« C’est un drame, parce que c’est d’abord la perte d’une vie humaine. Et puis c’est une entreprise agricole de moins sur notre territoire », résume Jean Poirier, maire de Saint-Basile, un village d’environ 2600 âmes dans la région de Portneuf, et dont la moitié de l’économie tourne autour de l’agriculture.



Peu avant Noël dernier, Rudy Ducreux, un jeune agriculteur d’origine française, mettait fin à ses jours en se pendant dans l’atelier de sa ferme, la ferme Ducrêt, située à un jet de pierre de la mairie.



Pour les gens du milieu, ce jeune agriculteur était une étoile filante dans le firmament des fromagers québécois. « C’était quelqu’un d’assez réservé. Mais dès que vous parliez d’agriculture, vous constatiez combien il était passionné! Ses fromages au lait cru, dont Le Gaulois de Portneuf, étaient exceptionnels, irremplaçables. On ne peut pas se permettre de perdre des gens comme lui », raconte Charles Trottier, copropriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines qui, partageant la même profession, l’a bien connu.



Les deux fromagers artisans ont passé à travers la crise de la listériose de 2008, qui a fait 2 morts et 38 malades, et où le gouvernement a fait jeter aux poubelles des milliers de kilogrammes de fromage. Dans un rapport sur la gestion de cette crise (2010), le ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation (MAPAQ) exonérait les fromages au lait cru en identifiant la bactérie coupable, le pulsovar 93, une souche de la bactérie Lysteria monocytigene, provenant de fromages au lait pasteurisé. Mais le mal était fait, le Québec ne compte plus aujourd’hui, avec le départ de Rudy Ducreux, que quatre ou cinq fromagers au lait cru, selon Normand Côté, président de l’Association des fromagers artisans du Québec, qui regroupe une trentaine de membres.



Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j'ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents.

– Charles Trottier



Un métier sous très haute tension



Le métier de fromager-artisan relève des 12 travaux d’Hercule. Il faut traire des vaches 2 fois par jour, 365 jours par année, car on ne peut pas fermer le pis des vaches comme l’eau d’un robinet. Il faut ensuite fabriquer son fromage dans des conditions hygiéniques aussi salubres qu’une salle d’opération d’hôpital. Et il faut l’emballer, le distribuer et le vendre dans les boutiques spécialisées ou les restaurants.



« C’est trois métiers dans un », explique Charles Trottier. Sans compter qu’il faut composer avec le stress de la météo, la ferme étant une usine à ciel ouvert, pour produire des fourrages et des grains afin d’alimenter les vaches.



C'est dans l'établi de sa ferme que le jeune agriculteur Rudy Ducreux a mis fin à ses jours.



De plus, ce métier s’exerce sous une charge administrative kafkaïenne. « Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j’ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents, dont un de fabrication du ministère de l’Agriculture, un permis du ministère de l’Environnement, un permis de transport du lait, de vente au détail, de l’organisme de certification biologique, de la municipalité… » poursuit Charles Trottier.



Comme si cette lourdeur administrative ne suffisait pas, la décision du gouvernement Trudeau de permettre l’importation de 16 000 tonnes métriques de fromages fins en provenance d’Europe dès le 21 septembre prochain sous l’Accord économique et commercial entre le Canada et l’Union européenne (AECG) risque de faucher plusieurs fromagers artisanaux du terroir québécois. « Cette importation, c’est l’équivalent de 640 fermes comme la nôtre. Il est illusoire de penser que nous ne serons pas affectés », croit Charles Trottier.



Depuis ses débuts, l’homme d’affaires a investi 1,8 million $ dans la fromagerie, dont 750 000 $ depuis deux ans, entre autres pour construire une nouvelle étable. Et il compte sur sa clientèle québécoise -- plus de 30 000 personnes visitent la fromagerie chaque année -- pour survivre.



Contrairement à Charles Trottier, qui dit travailler plus de 105 à 110 heures par semaine pour faire tourner la fromagerie avec son associé et une vingtaine d’employés, « Rudy, lui, opérait seul, avec l’énergie de la jeunesse ».



C’est peut-être parce qu’il devait se battre envers et contre tous que Rudy Ducreux avait surnommé son produit vedette « Le Gaulois de Portneuf », gagnant d’un prix Caseus (2011), sorte de Jeux olympiques annuels du fromage.



Charles Trottier, co-propriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines, a bien connu Rudy Ducreux, un champion fromager.



Combien d’agriculteurs se suicident?

« Je ne sais pas dans quelle mesure le cas de Rudy Ducreux est représentatif de l’état psychologique de l’ensemble des producteurs laitiers du Québec », dit Ginette Lafleur, doctorante au Centre de recherche et d’intervention sur le suicide et l’euthanasie (CRISE) à l’UQAM. Si les fromagers artisans ne transforment qu’une goutte de lait produite par les quelque 5 600 fermes laitières du Québec, ils sont le porte-étendard d’une industrie qui génère près de 30 % de toutes les recettes agricoles de la province.



Selon la doctorante, le métier d’agriculteur est reconnu comme l'un des plus à risque de stress à cause d’éléments incontrôlables comme la météo. Mais la mondialisation, les traités commerciaux, le prix du lait, le prix du quota, l’endettement des entreprises, les changements technologiques, les conflits familiaux, les chicanes de couple ou l’isolement sont tous des facteurs de stress qui s’additionnent et font grimper le taux de la détresse psychologique. « Jusqu’à ce que l’élastique pète », explique celle qui a étudié le malaise des agriculteurs tant au Québec qu’en France et en Suisse1.



Toutefois, la seule étude disponible sur le taux de suicide des agriculteurs québécois indiquait qu’il était le double de celui des hommes dans la population générale québécoise. Mais cette étude2 réalisée par Santé Canada date de trente ans (1971-1987). Le problème, pour obtenir l’heure juste, c’est que l’Institut national de la santé publique du Québec ne comptabilise pas les suicides par profession. En 2014, 845 Québécois se sont enlevé la vie et, depuis 1981, cette triste statistique annuelle oscille entre 795 et 1284 hommes.



Parmi les pays développés, la France s’est toutefois dotée en 2013 d’un Observatoire national du suicide qui dénombre 417 suicides chez les hommes agriculteurs entre 2007 à 2009, surtout dans les élevages de bovins.



Rudy Ducreux, l’arbre qui cache la forêt?



Notre enquête révèle cependant que le phénomène du suicide des agriculteurs existe bel et bien dans la campagne québécoise. Parlez-en à Laurier Gauthier, un voisin de Rudy Ducreux. L’homme de 67 ans est producteur de lait et copropriétaire avec ses frères de la seconde plus grosse érablière de la Belle Province. Il a offert de nous accompagner à la ferme Ducrêt.

La vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec.

– Laurier Gauthier

En chemin, à bord de son camion, M. Gauthier lance devant la ferme d’un de ses voisins. « Lui aussi il s’est suicidé. Puis pourtant, il avait de l’argent plein les poches. Il venait de s’acheter une Cadillac. Un bon matin, on apprend qu’il s’était tiré un coup de 22 en arrière des oreilles. Surprise totale ». Il ajoute avoir connu six personnes, dont cinq producteurs et un employé de ferme, qui se sont enlevé la vie dans un rayon de 12 kilomètres de son entreprise.



Quant au geste irrémédiable de Rudy Ducreux, M. Gauthier l’explique peut-être par une charge de travail trop lourde pour un seul homme, mais, « la vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec », dit-il. Maire de Saint-Basile durant une trentaine d’années, le producteur pointe du doigt l’actuel contexte socio-économique comme facteur important de détresse psychologique chez les producteurs agricoles. Il reproche à Québec, depuis le règne du ministre de l’Agriculture péquiste Jean Garon (1976-1985), champion de la souveraineté alimentaire, de nommer des ministres de l’Agriculture à temps partiel ou ignorant des enjeux.



Quant au fédéral, le producteur se demande jusqu’où Ottawa, dans l’actuelle renégociation de l’ALENA exigée par le président Donald Trump, est prêt à défendre la gestion de l’offre et ne pas la sacrifier au profit des secteurs du bois d’œuvre, de l’automobile ou de l’aviation.



Nous arrivons à la ferme Ducrêt. Rudy Ducreux avait acheté en 2004 la ferme de Luc Mailloux, un ex-fromager au lait cru, et frère du psychiatre controversé Pierre « Doc » Mailloux. Sur place, nous sommes accueillis par Connie McLellan, une jeune agricultrice de 28 ans originaire de Nouvelle-Écosse. Elle hésite à parler au journaliste, selon les conseils de l’avocat engagé par la succession « pour ne pas nuire à la vente de la ferme », prévue d’ici l’automne. Le corps de Rudy Ducreux a depuis longtemps été rapatrié par la famille.



Connie McLellan, une jeune productrice, s'occupe du troupeau de Rudy Ducreux.



La jeune femme explique avoir été recrutée pour traire le troupeau de 26 bêtes. À part le cliquetis des chaînes des vaches à l’étable, le silence règne autour de la maison, de la fromagerie, de l’établi et des remises désertés. Seul un chat en manque de caresses nous suit d’un bâtiment à l’autre.



Dans les champs adjacents, de la machinerie rouille au milieu de hautes herbes. Et on peut apercevoir de nouvelles plantations d’arbres sur les terres voisines autrefois cultivées. Comme l’arbre qui cache la forêt, le suicide du créateur du Gaulois de Portneuf cache un pan de l’agriculture québécoise en péril.
