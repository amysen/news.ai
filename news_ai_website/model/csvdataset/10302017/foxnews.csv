In a 2014 interview she noted, “We’ve made many attempts and been blocked by the Republicans in closing some of the corporate tax loopholes.","Women in public office often make women and their families a focus of their work. They put aside partisanship to support positive ideas that are meant to help women in the home, school, workforce, and the economy.

Now is an important moment to unite across the aisle and to encourage their male colleagues to make good on past promises of tax relief to American families. Instead, a handful of female senators on the left -- who once bemoaned our byzantine tax code and claimed to champion tax relief for working-class families -- are intentionally trying to block tax reform efforts. Not one of the 16 female Democratic senators voted to pass the Senate’s fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, which creates a procedural path for tax reform and tax cuts.

But their hypocrisy runs deeper.

In 2014, New York’s Kristin Gillibrand introduced legislation to triple the child care tax credit, pleading “If you can’t afford child care, your choice is to leave your job to take care of your children. It doesn’t have to be this way.” But now that the opportunity to provide relief for moms is here, she’s changing her tune.

She blasted the Trump tax plan as “a cruel joke” and vowed “to oppose this corporate welfare that will harm New York’s middle class.” Perhaps she isn’t aware of the president’s proposed expansion of the child tax credit, which would directly aid middle class families?

This is a missed opportunity: Women in Congress have a chance to demonstrate bipartisanship and leadership that will help women succeed in today’s economy by coming to the table to support needed tax changes.

Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin said of last Thursday’s budget vote, “I believe Wisconsin families need a tax break and that's what I'm working for.” However, the competing tax reform plan that she and Senator Cory Booker, D-N.J., introduced doesn’t offer a lot of tax relief for families, and it doesn’t simplify or change the tax code at all.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made the case that Congress must simplify our complex and burdensome tax code in 2016, when she introduced legislation to make tax filing easier and free for some Americans. In a report, she explained that preparing and filing returns consumed almost 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Warren should be pleased that simplicity is one of President Trump’s four principles for tax reform. Instead she called the Trump plan “warmed-over” and says it “delivers massive tax cuts to millionaires and giant corporations and kicks working families to the curb.”

Wouldn’t eliminating almost every deduction, loophole and exemption advance her goal of creating a simpler, fairer, and cheaper tax filing system?

Lowering the corporate tax rate is another favorite punching bag for senators on the left. This rhetoric might be convenient today, but it doesn’t match up with their previous statements recognizing that America desperately needs corporate tax reform.

Just this summer, California’s Senator Dianne Feinstein said, “I think one might look at the corporate rate. I think that’s a fair thing to do to see that it’s regionalized and equalized.” Yet, when the Trump proposal was released, she failed to mention the proposed corporate tax relief and just painted the entire framework as “a one-sided proposal that cuts taxes for the rich at the expense of everyone else.”

Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, also once saw the virtue of cutting corporate tax rates and eliminating loopholes, but seems to have changed her mind now. In a 2014 interview she noted, “We’ve made many attempts and been blocked by the Republicans in closing some of the corporate tax loopholes. I mean, I think we all want to lower corporate tax rates, but we want to quit letting certain people get goodies so they don’t have to pay any taxes.” In 2015, she couldn’t have been more crystal clear: “The current U.S. tax system is broken and needs reform.” Yet she’s also predictably walked away from considering the latest proposed tax reform.

This is a missed opportunity: Women in Congress have a chance to demonstrate bipartisanship and leadership that will help women succeed in today’s economy by coming to the table to support needed tax changes.

As of 2014—that’s the most recent year when data is available--there were 9.1 million women-owned businesses (WOB) generating $1.4 trillion in annual revenue. WOB account for nearly one third (31 percent) of privately-held firms.

Tax reform that lowers the corporate rate to 25 percent and individual rates to zero, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent will free up resources for these women to reinvest in their businesses. That could mean implementing a new marketing plan to attract new customers, upgrading machinery and technology, or hiring new workers. Lifting tax burdens are especially important to women-owned businesses because they are more likely than male-owned businesses to rely on personal forms of financing such as savings over traditional loans.

Cutting corporate rates could also increase the average American household income by $4,000 annually. Women manage household budgets and make decisions about expenses, so we know that extra income promises a long-overdue family vacation, bathroom renovation, postponed medical procedure, or braces for the kids.

It’s time for Democratic women in Congress to put down the #Resistance banner and join their Republican colleagues in delivering meaningful relief to women, their families, and their businesses.",Democratic women in the Senate were all for these tax reform principles until Trump proposed them,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/30/democratic-women-in-senate-were-all-for-these-tax-reform-principles-until-trump-proposed-them.html

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

The parents of a baby struck by meningitis have been told she will lose all of her limbs, her sight and hearing and suffer 90 percent brain damage in the worst case doctors have seen in 25 years.

Ten-month-old Kia Gott has already had her right arm removed and is due to have one of her legs amputated on Monday.

She was rushed to hospital four weeks ago after dad Paul, 35, went to check on her in the middle of the night, sensing something was wrong.

He put a light on and saw her face, neck and chest was covered in a terrible rash - a known symptom of meningococcal septicemia.

Paramedics arrived fast but Kia's veins had collapsed so they had to drill into her tiny shin to give her emergency drugs.

NURSE SERENADES DYING PATIENT WITH HER FAVORITE SONG

While that was happening the baby girl had a mini cardiac arrest and was rushed to Bradford Royal Infirmary, West Yorks.

Crushed parents-of-three Paul and Vikki, 30, were then told the devastating news that all four limbs would have to be removed.

An MRI scan also showed signs she would be deaf, blind and have 90 percent brain damage.

Despite doctors’ shocking prognosis, Kia’s parents are clinging on to hope she can still hear and see them and her older brother Kayden, eight, and sister Elsie, who is four.

She is now off a ventilator and although still sedated she is breathing for herself.

“Paul and Vikki are traumatized,"" Donna Gott, Paul's aunt, said. ""They know she is in a bad way but they can’t grasp she can’t hear or see them. They believe she is responding to them and their voices and when Elsie sings her nursery rhymes.

""She is yawning, moving her head and her arm - the hospital has said it’s the worst case of Meningitis C septicaemia they have seen there in 25 years,"" she said. “Because she is on so many drugs at the moment it’s hard to do the tests they need to find out for sure but they will keep monitoring her.

TEEN'S SORE THROAT SPIRALS INTO LIFE-THREATENING INFECTION

""An eye specialist has given some hope her eyes might still be healthy,"" Gott said. “Vikki has not left the hospital - she is feeling an immense sense of guilt and is scared if she leaves the hospital something bad will happen.

""It’s heartbreaking - Paul is a self-employed window-fitter and is still having to work two days a week because bills still need paying,"" she said. ""Kayden and Elsie are staying over at the hospital house with their mom at weekends. They are struggling too.”

Two days before Kia fell ill she had been at her older siblings’ school in Wyke, near Bradford, West Yorks., where the family live for a family photo.

Later that week Kia’s mom took her to the doctor, worried that she “was not herself.”

Hospital consultants have since told the family that the doctor would not have been able to detect meningitis at that time.

When Paul came home from work that night, Kia did not get excited to see him - which was unusual.

The worried parents stayed up with her until midnight then went to bed.

However, Paul awoke with a start at 2 a.m. and, driven by instinct, went to check on the baby, finding her covered in the rash.

“They have a long hard road ahead of them,"" Gott said. ""But there is hope. She will lose all four limbs but but she is responding when we talk by moving her head and her arms. She is even crying and yawning. We will have to see how she develops over the next two years.""

""Her hearing and sight is affected but that doesn't mean she will never hear or see again,"" she said. ""Paul and Vikki have accepted that it's life-changing but as long as she can hear and see they will get by.""

The NHS stopped giving the MenC vaccine to 12-week-old babies in July last year because the success of the vaccination program meant there were almost no cases of the disease in babies or young children in the UK.

Meningitis C septicaemia is caused by bacteria that lives in the back of throats of one in ten people, normally doing no harm.

However, if if it somehow gets into the blood system it can trigger a potentially life-threatening infection.

Gott said Kia will now face a long few months of rehabilitation and the family home will need adaptions to make it suitable for the baby when she is finally discharged from hospital.

To help pay for them the family has set up a fundraising page which had raised more than $13,000.

Last year the fast-food chain introduced its ""thick-cut venison steak with crispy onions and a juniper berry sauce"" in five states in an effort to appeal to America's hunters.

The sandwiches sold so well that the restaurant expanded the operation this year, Business Insider reports. On Saturday Oct. 21 the sandwich was available nationwide for $7.

""The positive response to our limited offering of venison last year was so widespread and passionate that we knew we had to find a way to offer it nationwide,"" Jim Taylor, chief marketing officer of Arby's Restaurant Group, said.

But while the venison sandwiches sold out quickly at many Arby's locations, not everyone was happy, NPR reports. Earlier this month, the Montana Wildlife Federation sent a letter to Arby's asking it not to sell the deer-meat sandwiches.

The hunting conservation group's executive director cites ""America's wildlife crisis in the 19th century"" that drove many animals to near-extinction and ""the principle of selling an animal that most Montanans recognize and hold dear as a wild animal and really a symbol of the Rocky Mountain West"" as issues.

But Arby's was quick to point out that the meat it used for its sandwiches was not procured through hunting, but rather from game farms in New Zealand.

Arby's also tested elk steak sandwiches at three locations.

The star went on to explain that she believes people need to constantly be talking about race and acknowledge the large population that believes someone is better than someone else based on the color of their skin. Additionally, she called on the church to lead the charge toward unity.

“I think we need to speak up, and we need to talk about it. Sometimes we kind of just don't talk about it because maybe in some ways we don't know what to say. We don't want to make a mistake.

Korie and her husband, Willie Robertson, adopted their son Will when he was just five weeks old. They’ve become proponents of adoption and previously told People that their son being biracial hasn’t come up in the way they raise him, only in how the public looks at them.

President Donald Trump identified the militant as Mustafa al-Imam and said his capture signified that the four Americans who died ""will never be forgotten."" Justice Department officials were escorting al-Imam by military plane to the United States, where he's expected to be tried in federal court.

""Our memory is deep and our reach is long, and we will not rest in our efforts to find and bring the perpetrators of the heinous attacks in Benghazi to justice,"" Trump said.

The Navy SEAL-led raid marked the first publicly known operation since Trump took office to target those accused of involvement in Benghazi, which mushroomed into a multiyear political fracas centered on Republican allegations of a bungled Obama administration response. Those critiques shadowed Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attacks, through her presidential campaign.

U.S. forces captured al-Imam just before midnight local time Sunday in Misrata, on Libya's north coast, U.S. officials said. He was taken to a U.S. Navy ship at the Misrata port for transport by military plane to Washington, where he's expected to arrive within the next two days, one of the officials said.

Once on American soil, al-Imam will face trial in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia as the FBI continues to investigate, the Justice Department said. He faces three criminal charges that were filed in May 2015 but only recently unsealed: killing or conspiring to kill someone during an attack on a federal facility, providing support for terrorists, and using a firearm in connection with a violent crime.

It wasn't immediately clear how al-Imam was involved in the Sept. 11, 2012, violence. The U.S. attorney's office said he is a Libyan national and about 46 years old.

Trump said he'd ordered the raid, and thanked the U.S. military, intelligence agencies and prosecutors for tracking al-Imam and enabling his capture. The U.S. officials said the operation was coordinated with Libya's internationally recognized government. They weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he'd spoken with the relatives of some of the Americans who died in Benghazi: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, State Department information management officer Sean Patrick Smith, and contract security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Tillerson said the U.S. would ""spare no effort"" to ensure al-Imam is held accountable.

Al-Imam will face court proceedings in U.S. District Court, officials said, in an apparent departure from Trump's previously expressed desire to send militants to the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

In an interview last March with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called Guantanamo ""a very fine place for holding these kind of dangerous criminals.""

The commando raid also came amid an ongoing debate about the use of U.S. forces to pursue insurgents in Africa and other locations outside of warzones like Iraq and Afghanistan. Four U.S. soldiers were killed in an ambush in Niger earlier this month under circumstances that have remained hazy and prompted Democrats and Republicans in Congress to express concerns.

Earlier this month, another man accused in the Benghazi attack, Abu Khattala, went on trial in federal court in Washington. Khattala, captured during President Barack Obama's tenure, has pleaded not guilty to the 18 charges against him, including murder of an internationally protected person, providing material support to terrorists and destroying U.S. property while causing death.

The Benghazi assault started in the evening when armed attackers scaled the wall of the diplomatic post and moved through the front gate. Stevens was rushed to a fortified ""safe room"" along with Smith, but were then siphoned off from security officers when attackers set the building and its furniture on fire. Libyan civilians found Stevens hours later in the wreckage, and he died of smoke inhalation in a hospital, becoming the first U.S. ambassador killed in the line of duty in more than three decades.

A nearby CIA annex was attacked by mortar fire hours after the diplomatic complex, killing Woods and Doherty, who were defending the rooftop.

The attack became fodder for multiple congressional investigations to determine what happened and whether the Obama administration misled the public on the details of the bloody assault. Initial accounts provided by administration officials, notably Obama's U.N. ambassador, Susan Rice, said the attack grew out of a protest against an anti-Muslim internet film. Later, the administration said it was a planned terrorist attack.

A two-year investigation by a House Benghazi committee focused heavily on Clinton's role and whether security at the compounds and the response to the attack was sufficient. It was the Benghazi probe that revealed Clinton used a private email server for government work, prompting an FBI investigation that proved to be an albatross for her presidential campaign.

And, per a survey it did of 1,000 millennials, salary is their chief consideration. So they may want to read on: The New York Times this week took a look at a burgeoning field with ""salaries that are startling even in an industry that has never been shy about lavishing a fortune on its top talent"": artificial intelligence.

The takeaway is that the annual package of salary and stock for a ""typical"" AI engineer—working on, says self-driving cars or smart home devices—tends to be in the $300,000 to $500,000 range.

As for who is getting those salaries, the Times reports there's a global pool of only about 10,000 people with the right set of skills, and so newly minted PhDs as well as ""people with less education and just a few years of experience"" are raking in the big bucks.

And, as a big-name athlete might do, they renew contracts every few years, for a multi-year take that has in some cases entered the eight-figure range.

The famous-athlete comparison goes pretty deep: A hiring manager at Microsoft said, ""That would make things easier. A lot easier,"" when the Times posed the idea of an NFL-like salary cap being imposed on skyrocketing AI salaries.

One wrinkle: the salaries are so alluring that many of the professors who are able to teach AI are being pulled out of academia. (Speaking of the NFL, one player is donating his entire 2017 salary.)

According to the ESPN report, team sources said the injury was “more significant” than a regular dislocation, and that the surgery required grafting tissue from Miller’s right leg to repair the damaged artery in his left leg.

On Monday, the Bears released a statement confirming Miller's sugery, and described the procedure as ""successful.""

""During our game at the New Orleans Saints yesterday, TE Zach Miller sustained a serious injury to his left knee and immediate evaluation from our medical team on site rushed him to nearby University Medical Center New Orleans (UMC) for urgen vascular sugery to repair a torn popliteal artery,"" the statement said.

""Successful surgery was performed immediately on Sunday by the UMC vascular sugeons to stabilize his injury. Zach remains at UMC, along with Bears medical personnel, where he will stay under further evaluation. We are thinking of Zach and his family and support from our entire organization goes out to them.""

PARENTS SHARE HEARTBREAKING PHOTOS OF BABY SET TO LOSE LIMBS TO MENINGITIS

At the time of the injury, Miller was attempting to haul in a 25-yard touchdown pass from rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, but his left leg bent awkwardly as he landed. The play was originally called a touchdown, but as Miller was carted off the field officials overturned the call and said that the ground caused the ball to loosen in his grasp as his upper body crashed to the turf.

“I didn’t watch it after I saw it the first time. To go from the elation of, ‘What a play, what a throw!’ in that situation of the game to overturn and Zach obviously being injured … it’s really unfortunate,” Kyle Long, a Bears offensive lineman, told The Chicago Tribune. “We lost a really good guy today.”

“Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS.
According to records filed with the Federal Election Commission, Obama for America paid Perkins Coie more than $972,000 after April of 2016.
A second batch of payments, also classified as “Legal Services,” were sent to the firm in September 2016, totaling nearly $700,000.
The Free Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this assertion.","President Trump tweeted early Monday about reports that the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to the firm behind the salacious anti-Trump dossier.

“Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS. The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?) from DNC. Nobody knows who OK’d!” Trump tweeted Monday morning.

The president was referring to a report by The Federalist on Sunday which alleged that former President Obama’s official campaign organization directed nearly one million dollars to Perkins Coie--the same law firm that sent money to Fusion GPS for the research leading to the now-infamous dossier.

According to records filed with the Federal Election Commission, Obama for America paid Perkins Coie more than $972,000 after April of 2016. The first round of payments were classified as “Legal Services” and were made in April 2016, totaling $98,047. A second batch of payments, also classified as “Legal Services,” were sent to the firm in September 2016, totaling nearly $700,000. The Obama for America organization also sent payments totaling $174,725 through August 2017, according to the report.

The report comes after a week of new information surrounding the dossier. On Friday, the Washington Examiner reported that Fusion GPS was initially hired by the conservative Washington Free Beacon website to conduct opposition research into then-candidate Donald Trump and other GOP contenders for the White House. Lawyers for the Free Beacon told the House Intelligence Committee that the website funded the research between fall 2015 and spring 2016.

House Intelligence Committee spokesman Jack Langer told Fox News Friday that the Free Beacon “has issued a statement asserting that it had no involvement with Christopher Steele or the dossier he compiled from Russian sources. The Free Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this assertion.

Also last week, Fox News confirmed reports that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid more than $9 million to Perkins Coie, which, in turn, retained the political consultants who commissioned the opposition research.

Hillary Clinton has been silent about the revelations, but her top campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, said last week that “she may have known, but the degree of exactly what she knew is beyond my knowledge,” while an anonymous source told reporters that she only learned about the dossier when it was published by BuzzFeed News in January.

A DNC official told Fox News that the current Chairman “Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization.”

A spokesman for then-DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., told Fox News last week that “she did not have any knowledge of this arrangement.”

When the revelations surfaced last week, the president called the project a “disgrace” and claimed the tables have turned on the Democrats in the “Russia hoax.”

“This whole Russia thing…this was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing the election,” Trump told reporters. “They lost it and they lost very badly. And they didn’t know what to say, so they made up the whole Russia hoax.”",Trump tweets on reports that Obama campaign paid law firm that hired Fusion GPS,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/30/trump-tweets-on-reports-that-obama-campaign-paid-law-firm-that-hired-fusion-gps.html

Colder weather brings us closer, but we often feel bored and irritable when the whole family is cooped up indoors. Instead of retreating to our own rooms or busying ourselves with more housework, consider starting a regular tradition for the family to enjoy together. There’s nothing quite as universally fun as a good game. Friendly competition and a lot of laughter is a recipe for a weekly family tradition that everyone will look forward to.

Dedicate a space to games and play. Now is an especially great time to get the game room ready before winter weather hits and you get snowed in for days on end. Despite the size of your space, you can always make room for fun. You could convert an attic, basement or den into a game room with some comfortable furniture, funky wall treatments and storage for toys, games and media.

Not all of us have enough space to dedicate an entire room to just games though. If not, make the most out of underused nooks by pulling up a couple of armchairs around a small table. You could also take advantage of double-duty furniture in your living room. Find a coffee table with built-in storage that makes board game setup and clean-up quick and easy. Don’t overlook decorative details either! Hang a scoreboard or stencil throw pillows with Scrabble-esque letters to instantly fun up any room.

Make it fun for everyone. The only way this will work is if everyone is having a good time. First, provide enough comfortable seating so every person feels included. Test each seat to make sure it’s positioned with a good view of the table, TV or everyone else in the room depending on what game you’re playing. A flexible seating arrangement with movable chairs and lightweight ottomans might be best.

Next, avoid making several trips up and down the stairs by keeping a variety of snacks closeby. If you have the luxury of adding a kitchenette to your room design, then go for it! Otherwise, loading up a tray or two will work just fine. Outfitting a cart with party supplies and packaged snacks can also work as a snack station for your game room. Pop some popcorn and pour drinks before you sit down to play. Preparing a snack might actually become part of your tradition. Every week you and your family can decide on a new snack to make and taste-test together, like fruit kabobs, homemade cookies or pigs in a blanket.

Lastly, allowing your kids to invite their friends to the first few game nights might be worth it. Even if you’re really looking forward to a night with the family, your kids - especially teens - might not be as keen on a night in with mom and dad. A lively group of friends for your very first game night could prove to your kids that this is a “cool” tradition to keep going.

Find the type of game you enjoy most. If game night feels forced, then it won’t be fun and it certainly won’t last long. Experiment with board games, card games, video games and even televised games to find something for everyone. If it’s a new game that you haven’t tried before make sure to spend some time reading and understanding the rules before game night begins. You’ll lose kids’ attention pretty quickly if you spend too long explaining the rules. It’s OK to have a couple of options too. Maybe two family members want to watch Monday night football while the other three play a game of Monopoly. It doesn’t matter what game night looks like at your house as long as everyone is together and having fun.",How to make family game night a weekly tradition,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/how-to-make-family-game-night-weekly-tradition.html

Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple.
On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.
President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

LAS VEGAS SHOOTING DETAILS STILL MURKY AS MANDALAY BAY ORDERED TO KEEP EVIDENCE

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

COUNTRY STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CMT ARTISTS

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

For her public duties, the Duchess of Cambridge is always pictured with au naturel nails, and there is strict reason for this.

According to OK! magazine, colored nail varnish and fake nails are not part of the royal etiquette, and are typically considered to be “vulgar.""

On the rare occasion that her nails do have a slick of polish on them, she opts for a nude shade, similar to the Queen’s personal favorite.

Queen Elizabeth is said to have worn Essie's Nail Lacquer in Ballet Slippers since 1989.

According to the brand's website, Queen Elizabeth's hairdresser wrote to the brand's owner, nail polish-mogul Essie Weingarten, asking for a bottle of the light pink polish as she didn't want to wear any other.

The only time Kate has deviated from the Ballet Slippers shade was her wedding day to Prince William.

On the big day, her manicurist Marina Sandoval revealed her nails were a custom mix of Bourjois So Laque Nail Enamel in Rose Lounge and Essie Nail Polish in Allure.

It’s not just the Duchess and the Queen who have been seen abiding by the nude nail varnish dress code.

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

Turn the lights down. If you’ve got absolutely no time to get ready for guests, you can try this last-ditch technique: Turn the lights down low, or close the blinds.

The darkness will hide many of your sins.",8 tricks to speed-clean your house before unexpected guests arrive,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/8-tricks-to-speed-clean-your-house-before-unexpected-guests-arrive.html

Much of the political left is cheering about the indictment of Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. They think it will undermine President Trump. The problem, though, is that it appears increasingly likely that Manfort’s indictment has nothing to do with the Trump campaign.

It is true that Robert Mueller began investigating Paul Manafort based on Manafort’s dealings with the Trump campaign and Russia. But the special prosecutor, like most prosecutors, can go in the direction an investigation takes him. If the investigation goes off the trail of the campaign into a new direction, the special prosecutor can go in that new direction. That appears to be the case here.

The federal investigators have been curious about various wire transfers during the 2012 period. Manafort has close ties to both Russian operatives and various other unsavory figures tied into Moscow’s political apparatus.

It appears he may have transferred money and accepted payments that he should not have and that he possibly failed to accurate report them on taxes. This is all based on the initial reports that are leaking out.","Erick Erickson: It's Paul Manafort's Indictment, Not Trump's",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/30/erick-erickson-its-paul-manaforts-indictment-not-trumps

The military action, which caused few casualties and was celebrated as a victory by the country's Arab majority, gave a further boost to the paramilitary forces.
""What happened in Kirkuk is a success for the Iraqi government and the Iraqi forces,"" Al-Muhandis said, adding that his forces had helped coordinate the Kurdish withdrawal to minimize clashes and casualties.
Al-Muhandis holds a ""pivotal"" position in Iraq's political and security hierarchy, said Nathaniel Rabkin, managing editor of Inside Iraqi Politics, a political risk assessment newsletter.
Smyth, the militia researcher, doubts such rules would be enforced, noting the long history of militia commanders cycling in and out of political office.","With the Islamic State group driven from nearly all of Iraq, U.S. officials have suggested that the thousands of mainly Shiite paramilitary fighters who mobilized against the Sunni extremists three years ago lay down their arms.

But Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who once battled U.S. troops and is now the deputy head of the state-sanctioned Popular Mobilization Forces, says they are here to stay.

""The future of the (PMF) is to defend Iraq,"" he told The Associated Press in his first extensive interview with a Western media outlet. ""The Iraqi army and Iraqi police say they cannot operate without the support of the Hashd,"" he added, using a shortened Arabic term for the paramilitary force.

In the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, al-Muhandis led the Hezbollah Brigades, a feared Shiite militia with close ties to Iran and the Lebanese militant group of the same name. His real name is Jamal Jaafar Ibrahim, but he's still better known by his nom de guerre, and his rise to the top ranks of Iraq's security apparatus reflects the long, slow decline of U.S. influence over the country.

He participated in the bombing of Western embassies in Kuwait and the attempted assassination of that country's emir in the early 1980s, for which he was convicted in absentia and added to the U.S. list of designated terrorists. But like many Shiite militants, he returned to Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Two years later, he was even elected to parliament, before being forced to step down under American pressure.

In 2009, the State Department linked him to the elite Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, calling him a ""threat to stability"" in Iraq, and as recently as last week it referred to him as a terrorist.

But in the summer of 2014, when the Islamic State group swept across northern Iraq, and the U.S.-trained and funded army collapsed, his and other Shiite militias mobilized in defense, halting the extremists on the outskirts of the capital. The mostly Iran-backed militias remained separate from the U.S.-led coalition, but over the next three years they helped Iraq's reconstituted military to drive IS out of most of the country.

Today, al-Muhandis, in his mid-60s, is among the most powerful men in Iraq, splitting his time between the front lines, Iran and his home and office in Baghdad's heavily-guarded Green Zone. He describes the PMF as a ""parallel military"" that will help keep the peace once IS is gone.

Al-Muhandis ""demonstrates that Iran has a direct venue with which to influence Iraqi politics, and a powerful one at that,"" said Philip Smyth, an expert on Shiite militias at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

""It's no secret,"" al-Muhandis said of his close relationship with Iran, the country where he spent decades in exile and underwent military training. He said he personally seeks spiritual and moral guidance from the country's leadership, but that the PMF only gets material support from Tehran.

Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson demanded that Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq return to their homes, integrate into the Iraqi army or leave the country.

Al-Muhandis casually dismissed the appeal. ""Tillerson is asleep,"" he said.

""Iran was the only country that supported Iraq from the beginning of the Daesh crisis,"" he said, referring to the IS blitz in 2014. ""It's like when you're in a hospital and you need blood. The Americans would be the one who would show up with the transfusion when it was too late.""

As to whether the Americans should remain in Iraq, Al-Muhandis said: ""We follow the Iraqi government despite our personal opinions, and our personal opinions are well known, so I won't repeat them here.""

The PMF sprang into action again earlier this month, when federal forces retook the northern city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas from Kurdish forces in response to the Kurds' vote for independence in September. The military action, which caused few casualties and was celebrated as a victory by the country's Arab majority, gave a further boost to the paramilitary forces.

""What happened in Kirkuk is a success for the Iraqi government and the Iraqi forces,"" Al-Muhandis said, adding that his forces had helped coordinate the Kurdish withdrawal to minimize clashes and casualties. ""We want a brotherhood with the Kurds,"" he said, referring to their shared struggle against Saddam Hussein in the 1980s.

The fighting nevertheless displaced thousands of people, according to the United Nations and Amnesty International, which documented the looting and destruction of ""hundreds"" of properties near Kirkuk.

International rights groups alleged widespread violations by the militias throughout the campaign against IS and said the government had failed to hold them accountable. Al-Muhandis and other commanders say any abuses were isolated incidents, and that perpetrators have been brought to justice.

Al-Muhandis rarely speaks to reporters, but his image is pervasive on social media, where he can be seen wearing olive fatigues and surveying front-line positions from Iraq's northern border to the western Anbar province, where troops and militiamen are battling IS in the last pocket under its control. He's often standing beside Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, and a key adviser to the PMF. Music videos shared online praise al-Muhandis' humility and fearlessness.

He can also be seen in photos attending strategy meetings chaired by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The PMF are officially an ""independent military formation"" under the prime minister's command.

Al-Muhandis holds a ""pivotal"" position in Iraq's political and security hierarchy, said Nathaniel Rabkin, managing editor of Inside Iraqi Politics, a political risk assessment newsletter.

""It's a source of concern in and outside Iraq,"" Rabkin said. ""If you have elements of the armed forces or the security forces loyal to a particular political party you're creating a setup where it will be very difficult to have free, fair and competitive elections that don't descend into violence.""

Iraq is set to hold parliamentary elections next year. When asked if his forces would participate in politics, al-Muhandis laughed, saying: ""Don't mention it or you'll scare off all the politicians."" He added that PMF fighters would be free to run for office, but must first leave the paramilitary organization.

Smyth, the militia researcher, doubts such rules would be enforced, noting the long history of militia commanders cycling in and out of political office.

Whether they run or not, Al-Muhandis said the PMF are ""the biggest force that can influence the upcoming elections.""",Iraqi militia commander brushes off US call to disband,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/30/iraqi-militia-commander-brushes-off-us-call-to-disband.html

Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to all charges. A judge set bond at $10 million for Manafort, and $5 million for Gates. Both sides agreed to home detention.

The special counsel’s office told Fox News that the counts include conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) statements, false statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts.

""President Donald Trump was correct. There is no evidence the Trump Campaign colluded with the Russia government,"" Kevin Downing, an attorney for Manafort, responded, referencing earlier tweets and statements from the president. ""A claim that maintaining offshore accounts to bring all your funds into the United States, as a scheme to conceal from the United States government, is ridiculous.""

Downing said outside court earlier Monday that Manafort was ""seeking to further democracy and to help the Ukraine come closer to the United States and the E.U.""

'This fight is just beginning.' - Glenn Selig, spokesman for Rick Gates

Glenn Selig, Gates' spokesman, said in a statement Monday that Gates ""welcomes the opportunity to confront these charges in court.""

""He is not going to comment further until he has had a chance to review the lengthy indictment with his legal team,"" Selig said. ""He would appreciate you respecting his and his family's privacy as they weather this unexpected and hasty proceeding designed to accommodate perhaps political and press considerations rather than his right to have counsel of his choice by his side during the most troubling and challenging day for him and his loved ones.""

Selig added: ""This fight is just beginning.""

Manafort and Gates appeared before Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson on Monday for their initial appearance and arraignment.

According to the indictment, reviewed by Fox News, between at least 2006 and 2015, Manafort and Gates acted as unregistered agents of the Government of Ukraine, the Party of Regions, a Ukrainian political party whose leader Victor Yanukovych was president from 2010 to 2014, and the Opposition Bloc. Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their work in Ukraine.

The indictment says that Manafort and Gates laundered the money through scores of the United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts in order to hide Ukraine payments from U.S. authorities.

More than $75 million flowed through offshore accounts. Manafort, alone, allegedly laundered more than $18 million which was used by the former Trump campaign chairman to buy property, goods, and services in the U.S., while concealing that income from the U.S. Treasury and the Department of Justice.

It’s the first time the 150-million-year-old fishlike reptile has been found on the sub continent.

At 5.5m long, this Jurassic-era sea monster doesn’t top the Ichthyosaur scales. Adults of the sleek, dolphin-like creature appear to have ranged in size from about 4.5m through to an enormous 9m.

But it is revealing. It’s very old. It was found among the remains of its prey. And it was found in India.

And new Australian research into some remarkably well preserved Ichthyosaur ‘cells’ in Germany provides new insight as to how these huge, lung-breathing beasts thrived in a low-oxygen atmosphere.

CRUNCHY LUNCH

The Ichthyosaur had large, strong teeth. And this one’s bones were embedded among fossilised ammonites and squid-like belemnites.

A close examination of the cracked, worn teeth shows the Ichthyosaur preferred crunchy food.

“We could infer from wear patterns on its teeth that this ichthyosaur was a top-tier predator that fed on hard and abrasive food material, including marine molluscs, fish and possibly other marine reptiles,” lead researcher Guntupalli Prasad said.

Details of the sea monster have been published in the journal PLOS ONE by the university of Delhi.

Ichthyosaur fossils have mostly been found in North America and Europe. A few have been uncovered in South America and Australia.

This one, found embedded in the very hard sedimentary rock of the Kachchh region of Gujarat, is almost complete.

After 1500 man-hours of excavation, only part of the skull and some of its tail bones were found to be missing. And its left forefin was remarkably well preserved in its original shape.

It appears to belong to the Ophthalmosauridae family of Ichthyosaurs, closely related to Northern Hemisphere varieties. It likely lived between 152 and 157 million years ago.

WORLDWIDE RANGE

The few other Ichthyosaur discoveries in India amount to just a few teeth or scattered vertebrate, and are some 50 million years younger than the new find.

At the time of its death, much of India was covered by a warm, tropical sea as the ancient supercontinent of Gondwanaland slowly began to break up.

Presad says Ichthyosaurs appeared to traverse a route linking modern-day India, Europe, Madagascar and South America.

“This is a remarkable discovery not only because it is the first Jurassic ichthyosaur record from India, but also it throws light on the evolution and diversity of ichthyosaurs in the Indo-Madagascan region of the former Gondwanaland and India’s biological connectivity with other continents in the Jurassic,” Presad writes.

“This find helps to show how globally widespread ichthyosaurs were during the time of dinosaurs,” University of Edinburgh palaeontologist Steve Brusatte told National Geographic. “They seem to have lived everywhere in the oceans, all over the world, at the same time dinosaurs were thundering across the land.”

OXYGEN OPTIMISATION

Curtin University professor Kliti Grice and PhD researcher Chloe Plet have published his research into the fossilised cell structure found in 183 million-year-old Early Jurassic ichthyosaur vertebra from Germany.

They found traces of red blood cells, collagen and cholesterol.

These were preserved as the fossil formed under carbonate concretion, a process where a carcass is trapped in an organic-matter rich environment with low oxygen conditions.

They also reveal how the lung-breathing creature coped with an Earth’s atmosphere containing much less oxygen than it does today.

“Ichthyosaurs evolved during a time when atmospheric oxygen levels were continuously low over a period of 70 million years,” Ms Plet says.

“During our analyses of the sample, we discovered red blood cell structures that were up to five times smaller than those reported in most modern organisms.

“We propose that small red blood cells were favourably produced by the species to provide efficient oxygen transport and diffusion. For example, modern-day mammals living at elevated altitudes with lower oxygen levels make small and abundant red blood cells.”

Kressa Shepherd, 17, died Sunday night at a Sacramento hospital, her aunt, Mindi Ramos, said Monday.

Doctors at Shriners Hospital for Children noticed Kressa did not register pain during a change of the dressing on her burns, Ramos said. After performing a CAT scan, they determined she was brain-dead, the aunt said.

""They kept her alive so we could say goodbye and eventually stopped the machines that were assisting her,"" Ramos said.

A neighbor found Kressa, who was a junior at Ukiah High School, and her mother lying on the ground outside their home in a rural neighborhood in Redwood Valley. Both had more than half their bodies burned.

Kressa's brother, 14-year-old Kai Shepherd, was found dead. He among the youngest who died in the wildfires.

First responders found their father, Jon Shepherd, separately, on the mountain. He was also badly burned but alive.

The Shepherds apparently tried to outrun the flames as the home their father built burned down.

Sara, 40, and Jon Shepherd, 44, remain hospitalized and have gone through several grafting surgeries.

Sara had burns in over 60 percent of her body and is at UC Davis Medical Center, in Sacramento. Jon was burned over 45 percent of his body and is hospitalized in stable condition at St. Francis Memorial Hospital's burn unit in San Francisco, Ramos said.

Her sister and brother-in-law are conscious but only talk in whispers, she said. They have not asked questions about what happened, Ramos said.

""We don't know how much they remember from that day. But we were advised to not give them the tragic news about their children unless they ask,"" Ramos said.

She said her family is staying strong for her sister.

""Her entire life has been devastated, and we're just taking it one breath at a time, one minute at a time,"" Ramos said.

The wildfires that started the night of Oct. 8 and swept across a wide area north of San Francisco are the deadliest and most destructive the state has ever seen. While much of the devastation is in Sonoma and Napa counties, the heart of California's wine country, fire also wiped out a swath of Redwood Valley, a community of about 1,800 roughly 70 miles north in Mendocino County.

Firefighters expect to fully contain the fatal fires that destroyed nearly 9,000 homes and businesses this week.

They think it will undermine President Trump. The problem, though, is that it appears increasingly likely that Manfort’s indictment has nothing to do with the Trump campaign.

It is true that Robert Mueller began investigating Paul Manafort based on Manafort’s dealings with the Trump campaign and Russia. But the special prosecutor, like most prosecutors, can go in the direction an investigation takes him. If the investigation goes off the trail of the campaign into a new direction, the special prosecutor can go in that new direction. That appears to be the case here.

The federal investigators have been curious about various wire transfers during the 2012 period. Manafort has close ties to both Russian operatives and various other unsavory figures tied into Moscow’s political apparatus.

It appears he may have transferred money and accepted payments that he should not have and that he possibly failed to accurate report them on taxes. This is all based on the initial reports that are leaking out.

If that is the case, Manafort and his associate Rick Gates are getting indicted for things far removed from the Trump campaign.

A talking point already shaping up on the left related to this is that Manafort must have been forced to work for Trump by the Russians.

The thinking goes that there is no way Manafort would have wanted to work on so high profile a campaign given his baggage. Someone must have forced him and that someone is the Russians.

This seems to be wishful thinking by members of the so-called Resistance who are lost in their fever dreams of Trump hatred.

Manafort worked on a number of high profile campaigns and just because you never heard of him before now does not mean he was an unknown or minor figure.

Manafort’s indictment in a matter unrelated to the Trump campaign gives the Trump team a new talking point. They had already made a few unflattering statements about Manafort and can now claim that this clears them.

The Mueller team looked into the campaign, went down various rabbit holes, and wound up in Manafort’s tax returns circa 2012, well before Trump considered running for office. Therefore, they can claim, there is nothing there with the campaign.

It is a believable talking point except for the fact that the investigation continues. Still, this will be a distraction from that investigation as media sharks circle Manafort.

One last point to consider here is that the press probably hopes, as some TV pundits are speculating, that Manafort’s indictment is designed to make him squeal about the Trump campaign. That all sounds well and good, but if Vladimir Putin really were involved the chances of Manafort squealing on anybody are really low — and there is no evidence that there is anything to squeal about. But the left’s fever dreams against Trump continue and Russia stealing the election is a necessary component to those dreams.

As long as Robert Mueller fails to turn up evidence to show Russia stole the election, the American left will continue to believe in an elaborate conspiracy. It is far easier to believe that than to believe Hillary Clinton ran a terrible campaign.","Erick Erickson: It's Paul Manafort's indictment, not Trump's",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/30/erick-erickson-its-paul-manaforts-indictment-not-trumps.html

Papadopoulos emailed seven other campaign officials in March 2016 to offer to set up a meeting with Russian officials to discuss “US-Russia ties under President Trump,” the Washington Post reported in August 2017. He would reportedly continue to make such offers as he worked with the campaign.

During the campaign, Papadopoulos reportedly traveled to Israelwhere he took part in an energy conference.

How is Papadopoulos tied to the Russia investigation?

After becoming an adviser to the Trump campaign, Papadopoulos interacted with a professor “understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials” who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, Trump’s campaign rival, according to court documents released by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office.

Papadopoulos had told investigators that the professor divulged the information prior to his joining the Trump campaign. However, “the professor only took interest in [Papadopolous] because of his status with” the campaign, according to court documents.

MUELLER’S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

Papadopoulos also “repeatedly” attempted to use the professors’ Russian connections as well as that of a “female Russian national” to arrange meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials, according to the Special Counsel’s Office.

He is cooperating with the FBI's investigation, according to court documents.

Additionally, Paul Manafort, 68, the former campaign chairman for President Trump, and his associate, Rick Gates, 45, were indicted by a federal grand jury on Monday on 12 charges stemming from conspiracy against the U.S., to conspiracy to launder money.

What else should you know about him?

Prior to joining Trump’s campaign, Papadopoulos was an adviser for Dr. Ben Carson’s own 2016 presidential campaign.

Aside from campaign work, Papadopoulos has worked as an oil and gas consultant, his LinkedIn page said. Much of his work has revolved around natural gas and Greece, Cyprus and Israel, according to the Washington Post.

He was also the director of the Center for International Energy and Natural Resources Law & Security at the London Center of International Law Practice.

From Chicago, Ill., Papadopoulos graduated from DePaul University in 2009. He also received a Master of Science from the University of London, according to his LinkedIn page.","George Papadopoulos, ex-Trump aide, pleads guilty in connection to Russia probe: Who is he?",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/30/george-papadopolous-ex-trump-aide-pleads-guilty-in-connection-to-russia-probe-who-is.html

Lisa and Greg Pace were drawn to the tiny town, which boasts about 600 residents, because of its ties to World War II with the Courtland Air Base, which was built during the war as an instrumental training center.

Lisa told the Decatur Daily this past is what they pulled from for their restaurant, The Warbird Diner’s aesthetic.

“The design for the interior came from the 1940s when the Courtland Air Base was a training facility for the Army Air Corps pilots,” Lisa Pace said. “The airbase has a lot of history that many people don’t know about.”

The restaurant is decorated with war memorabilia, photographs and ceiling fans that look like a nose from a WWII fighter jet. She also said they are planning to recreate the restaurant’s sign using parts of an old plane.

The couple originally “wanted to be in an old building on the Courtland square,” but they had to move away from the center because nothing was available. The community seems to be enjoying the diner right where it is.

“I’m glad this restaurant opened,” retired NASA contractor and Courtland resident Phillip Morris said while eating a hamburger steak last week. “[Courtland] needed one badly.”

Courtland Councilwoman Shennell Hughes agreed with the 81-year-old Morris. Hughes said she has been praying more businesses will locate in the town, which has been struggling financially.

“It’s awesome to see a new business come to Courtland,” she said. “It could be the green sprout the town has needed to spark business activity. The citizens have been very supportive of the restaurant since it opened.”

The diner, which opened early this month, serves traditional American and southern fare like catfish, chicken wings, pork chops and burgers. Lisa told the Daily that the fried apple pie is the most popular dessert on the menu.

Manafort’s indictment in a matter unrelated to the Trump campaign gives the Trump team a new talking point.","Much of the political left is cheering about the indictment of Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. They think it will undermine President Trump. The problem, though, is that it appears increasingly likely that Manfort’s indictment has nothing to do with the Trump campaign.

It is true that Robert Mueller began investigating Paul Manafort based on Manafort’s dealings with the Trump campaign and Russia. But the special prosecutor, like most prosecutors, can go in the direction an investigation takes him. If the investigation goes off the trail of the campaign into a new direction, the special prosecutor can go in that new direction. That appears to be the case here.

The federal investigators have been curious about various wire transfers during the 2012 period. Manafort has close ties to both Russian operatives and various other unsavory figures tied into Moscow’s political apparatus.

It appears he may have transferred money and accepted payments that he should not have and that he possibly failed to accurate report them on taxes. This is all based on the initial reports that are leaking out.

If that is the case, Manafort and his associate Rick Gates are getting indicted for things far removed from the Trump campaign.

A talking point already shaping up on the left related to this is that Manafort must have been forced to work for Trump by the Russians.

The thinking goes that there is no way Manafort would have wanted to work on so high profile a campaign given his baggage. Someone must have forced him and that someone is the Russians.

This seems to be wishful thinking by members of the so-called Resistance who are lost in their fever dreams of Trump hatred.

Manafort worked on a number of high profile campaigns and just because you never heard of him before now does not mean he was an unknown or minor figure.

Manafort’s indictment in a matter unrelated to the Trump campaign gives the Trump team a new talking point. They had already made a few unflattering statements about Manafort and can now claim that this clears them.

The Mueller team looked into the campaign, went down various rabbit holes, and wound up in Manafort’s tax returns circa 2012, well before Trump considered running for office. Therefore, they can claim, there is nothing there with the campaign.

It is a believable talking point except for the fact that the investigation continues. Still, this will be a distraction from that investigation as media sharks circle Manafort.

One last point to consider here is that the press probably hopes, as some TV pundits are speculating, that Manafort’s indictment is designed to make him squeal about the Trump campaign. That all sounds well and good, but if Vladimir Putin really were involved the chances of Manafort squealing on anybody are really low — and there is no evidence that there is anything to squeal about. But the left’s fever dreams against Trump continue and Russia stealing the election is a necessary component to those dreams.

As long as Robert Mueller fails to turn up evidence to show Russia stole the election, the American left will continue to believe in an elaborate conspiracy. It is far easier to believe that than to believe Hillary Clinton ran a terrible campaign.","Erick Erickson: It's Paul Manafort's indictment, not Trump's",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/30/erick-erickson-its-paul-manaforts-indictment-not-trumps.html

The JFK files are out. Well, sort of. After President Donald Trump promised transparency in a tweet earlier in the week, thousands are still being withheld by the government after some were released Thursday night.

Indeed, Manafort’s indictment can be viewed on two levels.
So the Manafort indictment only makes the entire Russian collusion narrative more murky rather than less.","The news that GOP political fixer Paul Manafort and an associate have been indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on money laundering and conspiracy charges isn’t a stunning surprise. Manafort’s career in Washington was often conducted in and out of the shadows. Now he’s been dragged under a searchlight. Manafort should have known you should be careful what you wish for in politics.

A former political consultant, the 68-year-old Manafort had been out of active politics for over a quarter century. He’d become a sometime lobbyist and political operator with many international clients. But in April, 2016, his old bad boy business partner Roger Stone, a frequent advisor to Donald Trump, helped land him the job of Trump campaign manager. The gig promised to be exciting, would raise Manafort’s profile with his business clients and, hey, Trump was on course to win the GOP nomination and perhaps even the presidency.

Trump did indeed go all the way, but for Manafort the assignment was a disaster. He boasted to reporters he would make Trump “more presidential,” enraging a boss who hates the idea of political handlers.

That was only the beginning of the bad news. Manafort for a decade had business ties to Ukraine, where he did work for Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire oligarch linked to Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin. In July, 2016, Ukrainian sources inside the anti-Putin government there leaked ledgers that showed large cash payments to Manafort in exchange for his work for a pro-Putin political party. Many speculated that Manafort might not have reported all the income.

The Manafort indictment only makes the entire Russian collusion narrative more murky rather than less. Certainly, it is an embarrassment to the Trump White House. But it may ultimately be equally embarrassing for other parties when we learn just how tangled a web Manafort weaved.

Those revelations were the final straw for a campaign that was already under attack for being too ambivalent about Russian misdeeds. The Trump campaign itself was sputtering in mid-August and Manafort was replaced by the triad of Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and David Bossie.

Manafort may have left the campaign, but time bombs he planted while he was there continue to explode around Team Trump. His Ukrainian business dealings included a series of mysterious money transfers from overseas accounts to domestic U.S. businesses like car dealerships. Apparently, those transfers were enough to convince the federal court overseeing U.S. intelligence agencies to being surveillance of Manafort’s office in Trump Tower in New York beginning only a month after he became campaign manager.

An additional reason to continue investigating Manafort arrived in June, 2016 when Manafort, Donald Trump Jr., and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner met with a Russian lawyer with the advertised purpose of sharing damaging information on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Nothing apparently came of the meeting, and the Russian lawyer has since been linked to both the Kremlin and the dirt-digging firm Fusion GPS that commissioned the infamous anti-Trump “Steele” dossier. Could the meeting have been a possible “sting” operation designed to implicate Team Trump in collusion they really never engaged in?

Indeed, Manafort’s indictment can be viewed on two levels. On the one hand, Special Counsel Mueller could be using it to squeeze Manafort for information on Trump higher-ups, perhaps including the president himself. But recent revelations that Manafort frequently worked on Russian-Ukrainian issues with Democratic super-lobbyist Tony Podesta - the brother of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta - raises lots of questions. Podesta’ firm is reportedly under investigation by Mueller’s office for possible failure to report its lobbying activities on behalf of foreign clients.

So the Manafort indictment only makes the entire Russian collusion narrative more murky rather than less.

On the other hand, prosecutors are presenting evidence of wounds to several service members who searched for Bergdahl as aggravating evidence to push for a stiff punishment.","Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl unexpectedly took the stand at his sentencing hearing Monday -- and choked up several times as he apologized to service members who were wounded in the years-long hunt to save him.

""I would like everyone who searched for me to know it was never my intention for anyone to be hurt, and I never expected that to happen,"" he said during the hearing at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. ""My words alone can't take away their pain.""



He was the first witness for the defense, who hadn't previously made it known that Bergdahl would address the court. It was his most extensive remarks in court yet.

Asked by a defense attorney what the worst part of captivity was, he responded that it wasn't the beatings. ""The worst was the constant, just the constant deterioration of everything. The constant pain from my body falling apart. The constant screams from my mind,"" he said. ""It was the years of waiting to see whether or not the next time someone opens the door if that would be the person coming to execute you.""



He gave an unsworn statement, meaning that the judge will consider it but Bergdahl won't be cross-examined by the prosecutors.

Earlier, the wife of a soldier who was shot in the head during a search mission Bergdahl in Afghanistan delivered emotional testimony, tearing up as she described him as no longer being able to play with her children and how they “can't even hold hands anymore.”

Shannon Allen, the final witness for the prosecutors, said National Guard Master Sgt. Mark Allen is unable to speak, uses a wheelchair and needs help with everyday tasks.

""He's not able to reach out for her or talk to her,"" she said, pausing to take a deep breath as she referred to the brain injury's effect on his interactions with their daughter, who was an infant when he was wounded in 2009 after being ambushed by insurgents. She is now 9 and Mark Allen is in his mid-30s. ""He's never had the chance to really play with her or help coach her sports or ask about her day.""

Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison after pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. He was held by Taliban allies for five years after he left his remote post in Afghanistan in 2009.

Before the injury, Allen's husband was an outdoorsman who was ""very loud and outgoing,"" she said. He loved playing outside with his son from a previous relationship.

ARMY SGT. BOWE BERGDAHL: WHO IS HE?

Mark Allen's wife said he can smile, make eye contact and sometimes make a thumbs up, but he has little communication beyond that. Prosecutors showed a video of Shannon Allen and a home care nurse going through their routine of rolling his limp body into a sling to get him out of bed and into a wheelchair each day.

""He lost me as a wife, essentially, because instead of being his wife I am his caregiver,"" she said. ""I mean, we can't even hold hands anymore.""

Bergdahl, a 31-year-old soldier from Hailey, Idaho, made no deal with prosecutors to limit his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to determine his sentence.

Bergdahl said he tried to escape more than a dozen times from his Taliban captors -- where he was caged, kept in the darkness and beaten -- before President Barack Obama brought him home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

The judge in the sentencing hearing, Army Col. Jeffery Nance, also ruled Monday that President Trump's scathing criticism of Bergdahl won't prevent the soldier from receiving a fair sentence.

BERGDAHL SENTENCING: NAVY SEAL BREAKS DOWN WHILE DESCRIBING DEATH OF MILITARY DOG

Nance said the court has not been directly affected by Trump's remarks, nor would the comments cause a reasonable member of the public to have doubts about the fairness of the military justice system. He had to consider both questions in deciding on whether actual or apparent unlawful command influence was interfering in the case.

""I am completely unaffected by any opinions President Trump may have about Sgt. Bergdahl,"" the judge said. He added that prosecutors had convinced him that the Trump comments won't put ""an intolerable strain"" on the public perception of military courts.

Then-Republican nominee Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a traitor on the campaign trial and suggested that he be shot or thrown from a plane without a parachute. Trump revived those comments when Bergdahl pleaded guilty on Oct. 16 by saying at a news conference that he thinks people are aware of what he said before.

The White House later released a statement that, while not mentioning Bergdahl by name, said that every military justice case should be decided by military personnel using their own judgment. Nance cited that statement in his ruling.

Nance did say he would keep Trump's comments in mind as he weighs other factors that will go into his sentencing decision. The hearing is expected to last several more days.

Those mitigating factors, such as Bergdahl's mental health or his time in captivity by Taliban allies, would encourage leniency. On the other hand, prosecutors are presenting evidence of wounds to several service members who searched for Bergdahl as aggravating evidence to push for a stiff punishment.

Research published Friday by Stanford University in the Journal of Sexual Medicine shows that those who smoke marijuana every day have 20 percent more sex than those who don’t inhale.

“Frequent marijuana use doesn’t seem to impair sexual motivation or performance. If anything, it’s associated with increased coital frequency,” the study’s senior author, Michael Eisenberg, an assistant professor of urology at Stanford, said in a statement.

The study, however, stops short of saying there’s a causal connection between pot and sex.

They found women who smoked pot daily had sex 7.1 times a month on average, while men who got high every day got busy 6.9 times a month.

People who didn’t smoke weed at all had sex, on average, six times a month for women and 5.6 times a month for men.

The findings applied to people of all races, ages, education and income levels, religions, health status, marital status and parental status.

More than 20 million adult Americans are current marijuana users, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Pot is legal for medical or recreational use in 29 states.

But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.","A painting by famed 18th century Mexican artist Miguel Cabrera – long believed lost to history - may have been hanging in obscurity on the wall of a Los Angeles home for the last 60 years.

The artwork, nicknamed “Española,” is the only missing piece from the 16 Cabrera did in a series of casta, or caste, paintings. The painting's location remained a mystery for decades, until two years ago, when Ilona Katzew, the curator of Latin American art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, received a cryptic letter written in the voice of the little girl featured in the artwork.

“You should know that I am well and living less than two (2) miles from LACMA,” Española wrote in the letter to Katzew, the Los Angeles Times reported. “I have been in the same family for I believe 60 years, although I do not know how I was acquired.”

Since opening the letter, Katzew has puzzled over where in that two mile radius “Española” is hiding, but clues to the painting’s whereabouts are few and far between.

The three-paragraph letter gave no more indication of the painting’s location or means of contacting the owner. The mailing label was trimmed down to remove any information about its origin. The postage was a pair of 37-cent stamps – retired a decade before the letter was sent – and a commemorative stamp honoring writer Jack London that was issued in 1988.

Five photos of the painting – the only ones known to exist of the work - were also included with the letter, but the only information that Katzew was able to glean from them was that the artwork was in a modern frame and that it was apparently hanging high on a wall.

In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.

“If you ever gather a reunion of all my siblings, I would welcome the opportunity to be on display for a limited period of time,” the letter noted. “I am not lost, I just do not wish to be found.”

The 16 paintings in Cabrera’s casta series – an art style that explored interracial marriages and children in the Spain’s New World colonies – were purportedly sent to Spain from Mexico shortly after the artist’s death and displayed in the home of the Viceroy of New Spain, Joaquin de Montserrat.

In 2015, 14 of the painting were housed in museums across the U.S., Spain and Mexico. The most recently discovered one – a painting of a Spanish father, his half-Spanish, half-African wife, and their albino baby – was found under a couch in a northern California home and quickly obtained by LACMA.

“My owner has enjoyed seeing #6,” Española’s letter said in reference to the most recently acquired painting, “and I am pleased that we are all now accounted for despite the diaspora.”

But it’s been two years since the most recent Cabrera was acquired – and since Española’s letter – and Katzew hasn’t had any other contact with the painting’s owner. But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.",Cryptic letter taunts museum curator looking for missing masterpiece,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/cryptic-letter-taunts-museum-curator-looking-for-missing-masterpiece.html

The parents of a baby struck by meningitis have been told she will lose all of her limbs, her sight and hearing and suffer 90 percent brain damage in the worst case doctors have seen in 25 years.

Ten-month-old Kia Gott has already had her right arm removed and is due to have one of her legs amputated on Monday.

She was rushed to hospital four weeks ago after dad Paul, 35, went to check on her in the middle of the night, sensing something was wrong.

He put a light on and saw her face, neck and chest was covered in a terrible rash - a known symptom of meningococcal septicemia.

Paramedics arrived fast but Kia's veins had collapsed so they had to drill into her tiny shin to give her emergency drugs.

NURSE SERENADES DYING PATIENT WITH HER FAVORITE SONG

While that was happening the baby girl had a mini cardiac arrest and was rushed to Bradford Royal Infirmary, West Yorks.

Crushed parents-of-three Paul and Vikki, 30, were then told the devastating news that all four limbs would have to be removed.

An MRI scan also showed signs she would be deaf, blind and have 90 percent brain damage.

Despite doctors’ shocking prognosis, Kia’s parents are clinging on to hope she can still hear and see them and her older brother Kayden, eight, and sister Elsie, who is four.

She is now off a ventilator and although still sedated she is breathing for herself.

“Paul and Vikki are traumatized,"" Donna Gott, Paul's aunt, said. ""They know she is in a bad way but they can’t grasp she can’t hear or see them. They believe she is responding to them and their voices and when Elsie sings her nursery rhymes.

""She is yawning, moving her head and her arm - the hospital has said it’s the worst case of Meningitis C septicaemia they have seen there in 25 years,"" she said. “Because she is on so many drugs at the moment it’s hard to do the tests they need to find out for sure but they will keep monitoring her.

TEEN'S SORE THROAT SPIRALS INTO LIFE-THREATENING INFECTION

""An eye specialist has given some hope her eyes might still be healthy,"" Gott said. “Vikki has not left the hospital - she is feeling an immense sense of guilt and is scared if she leaves the hospital something bad will happen.

""It’s heartbreaking - Paul is a self-employed window-fitter and is still having to work two days a week because bills still need paying,"" she said. ""Kayden and Elsie are staying over at the hospital house with their mom at weekends. They are struggling too.”

Two days before Kia fell ill she had been at her older siblings’ school in Wyke, near Bradford, West Yorks., where the family live for a family photo.

Later that week Kia’s mom took her to the doctor, worried that she “was not herself.”

Hospital consultants have since told the family that the doctor would not have been able to detect meningitis at that time.

When Paul came home from work that night, Kia did not get excited to see him - which was unusual.

The worried parents stayed up with her until midnight then went to bed.

However, Paul awoke with a start at 2 a.m. and, driven by instinct, went to check on the baby, finding her covered in the rash.

“They have a long hard road ahead of them,"" Gott said. ""But there is hope. She will lose all four limbs but but she is responding when we talk by moving her head and her arms. She is even crying and yawning. We will have to see how she develops over the next two years.""

""Her hearing and sight is affected but that doesn't mean she will never hear or see again,"" she said. ""Paul and Vikki have accepted that it's life-changing but as long as she can hear and see they will get by.""

The NHS stopped giving the MenC vaccine to 12-week-old babies in July last year because the success of the vaccination program meant there were almost no cases of the disease in babies or young children in the UK.

Meningitis C septicaemia is caused by bacteria that lives in the back of throats of one in ten people, normally doing no harm.

However, if if it somehow gets into the blood system it can trigger a potentially life-threatening infection.

Gott said Kia will now face a long few months of rehabilitation and the family home will need adaptions to make it suitable for the baby when she is finally discharged from hospital.

To help pay for them the family has set up a fundraising page which had raised more than $13,000.

You may have heard of, or even created, a home inventory before. This record, often used to document belongings for insurance purposes, can also be a really helpful tool if you are trying to declutter, prepare for emergencies, clear space for a remodel or just get organized. Check out these tips to create a thorough home inventory and streamline your belongings at the same time.

Make Your Inventory

Choose your checklist. The first step in making a home inventory is getting your hands on a comprehensive checklist — one from your own insurance company is best. Review the checklist before getting started.

Work through your home, room by room. Following your checklist, work your way slowly through the entire house — you may want to divvy up the task over several weekends. Record a brief description of each item, how many you have, how much it cost and the year you purchased it.

Don't leave out any nooks or crannies. Craft rooms, sheds, attics, workshops, porches and garages should all be carefully examined and documented.

Supplement with photos or video. Using digital photos is one option, but you may find it easier to create a video tour of your home to document your belongings. Whether you are taking photos or video, start at the front and work your way through each room — try to go in the same order used on your checklist.

Add a storage map. Noting down where exactly in the house everything is stored can be incredibly useful when you need to find something, whether it's an emergency or just time to hang the Christmas lights.

Use an actual floor plan if you have one; if not, you can create your own simple sketch of each floor of your house. Being as specific as possible, note where in each room boxes or other items are stored.

Keep paperwork in one place. Gather receipts, credit card statements, appraisal documents and the like, and keep them bundled with your other home inventory materials.

Even better, take the time to scan everything and store the digital archive in at least two places.

Use Your Home Inventory to Declutter

Get rid of unnecessary multiples. Cutting back on excess multiples can free up a lot of space in your home, but actually getting rid of unneeded things is easier said than done. Your home inventory checklist can make things easier by providing emotional distance.

Read over your list and mark any items you have a lot of. Do you really need all of those extra dishes? Start a list of things you want to sell or donate.

Highlight valuable items. Especially note valuable pieces you've been holding onto for a long time but are not necessarily using. Do online research and estimate what you could sell the pieces for. Would you rather have the extra space and money? If so, let those pieces go!

Mark your calendar for a big junk toss. You know that stuff you've been meaning to toss but haven't found the motivation to? We all have it. Now that you know exactly what and where yours is, set a date to (finally) take care of it.

Get prepared by researching where you can take it — things in good condition may be candidates for donation, while others may need to be dropped at a special recycling center. Involving a reward at the end of your day of errands is always a good plan!

Box everything. Now that you've cleared out space in your storage areas, think about ways to make your storage really work for you. One simple but effective strategy is to tuck every single item in storage — whether in closets, cupboards or in deep storage — into a box or bin.

Containers instantly make things look neater, and it's also easier to shift items around or grab a box you need rather than trying to unload armfuls of loose stuff from a shelf.

Use storage for rotating items too. Free up space in cupboards, closets, shelves and counters for the items you actually use daily, and pack away the rest. This is one of the best ways to make your life easier, without getting rid of a drastic amount of stuff. Simply rotate in fresh dishes, linens and decorative items seasonally.

RELATED: Storage Cabinets That Fit Your Every Need

Consider digital backups. Creating digital backups (photos or scans) of important paper records, photos, kids’ art and other memorabilia can offer peace of mind. For less sentimental items, you may choose to actually toss the originals and keep only the digital record.

Remember to also …

Update your inventory. Anytime you buy something new or get rid of something on your list, pull out that inventory and note the change. If it’s something new you are adding, use this as a cue to look for a similar item on your inventory to get rid of. It’s much easier to keep clutter at bay than deal with it after things have gotten out of hand.

Keep a copy of your inventory offsite. Use a safe-deposit box or an online cloud-based storage system to keep your home inventory and all supporting documents secure.",How to create a home inventory to be organized and prepared for emergencies,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/how-to-create-home-inventory-to-be-organized-and-prepared-for-emergencies.html

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

ANTHONY BOURDAIN WORRIES IF HE CONTRIBUTED TO 'MEATHEAD CULTURE' OF RESTAURANT INDUSTRY

The bill aims to close a loophole which currently leaves models open to potential harassment on the job from people such as photographers, designers and agency employees, Moneyish reports. Because models are typically classified as independent contractors, they are often excluded from standard employment protections, but this bill would provide them protection against sexual harassment.

“There’s no accountability when it comes to who ultimately has to respond to sexual harassment in the workplace,” Rozic said to Moneyish. “The bill addresses this loophole in the law by making it an unlawful practice for a modeling entity — whether it be this talent agency or management company — to subject a model to harassment, regardless of whether they’re an independent contractor or employee.”

Rozic’s bill, which was developed with New York-based advocacy group Model Alliance, would hold modeling agencies accountable for misconduct on the job.

The current ACU weighs about 1.4 pounds and has lots of pockets and multiple layers of fabric. This means that “when it gets wet, it tends to stay wet,” the Army explained in a statement released this week. “And when it's hot out, it tends to keep soldiers hot,” it added.

The answer is the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform, which has fewer pockets, layers of fabric and Velcro, the Army said. The new uniform also uses a lighter fabric.

THE EVOLUTION OF US MILITARY CAMOUFLAGE: FROM BASIC GREEN AND KHAKI TO DIGITAL PATTERNS AND BEYOND

""You can hold that uniform up with one finger,"" said Brig. Gen. Brian P. Cummings, Program Executive Officer (PEO) Soldier, out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in the statement.

While the current ACU has had a lot of positive feedback, Cummings noted that the likes of shoulder pockets, pen pockets, leg pockets and Velcro swatches for patches require multiple layers of fabric, fastening material and buttons. All of these features hold water “and cost money,” he added.

The jacket from the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform is on display at PEO Soldier.

HISTORY OF CAMOUFLAGE IN PICTURES

U.S. soldiers in jungle environments will be the first to get their hands on the lightweight uniform, specifically the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. Cummings said that the Army eventually wants to make the uniform available to all soldiers.

The Army hopes that the new uniform will be available within a year. Cummings explained, however, that the new uniform’s fabric may prove more susceptible to wrinkling after washing. This could be fixed with the application of an anti-wrinkling treatment, although that would depend on whether the treatment interfered with the uniform’s ability to wick away water.

The new uniform’s flame-resistant capability also needs to be considered, according to Cummings.

In addition to the new uniform, the Army is also working on a new jungle boot. Last month, soldiers in the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii received 30,000 pairs of the new design to evaluate.

EVOLUTION OF COMBAT BOOTS: FROM BOOTEES TO MODERN TACTICAL BOOTS

Feedback on the boots has been positive, but Cummings said that soldiers want a boot that is lighter and softer. They have also requested thinner soles.

The next set of samples, Cummings said, will be ""a lot more pliable. And able to serve the soldier well. But instead of lasting five years, they [will] last two years.""

The newer boots will also go through evaluation with soldiers and share features with the boots currently being tested. These capabilities include puncture resistance, more drainage holes, the ability to wick away water, the ability to push water and mud off the soles, speed laces and lower profile heels so as not to catch on vines on the jungle floor, according to the Army’s statement.

“The university acknowledges that this installation will provoke a range of reactions, including offense at the use of the American Flag and use of the KKK and Nazi symbols.","A Florida professor sparked outrage after she transformed three American flags into Ku Klux Klan hoods.

The flags shaped like KKK hoods had the eyes burnt out with nothing but darkness behind them and sat on poles with bases shaped like Nazi swastikas. The artwork is part of the University of Miami’s annual faculty art show, gallery director Milly Cardoso told the Miami New Times.

Billie Grace Lynn, a University of Miami associate professor of sculpture, calls it “American Mask,” a work, she writes on her personal site, that suggests “bigotry and racism are hiding behind our flag.”

“This is disgusting. This is disrespectful,” Patrick Young, a black employee who works in the same building as the UM art gallery, told WSVN. “I can’t see it being a positive message any way you put it.”

The artwork, which will be on display until Nov. 12, has angered many who say it defaces the American flag and is outright offensive.

“What can this actually help?” Young said. “Burning an American flag? I have no idea what this symbolizes, what this helps out. Who does this reach?”

Lynn told the University of Miami News this was the intent of her piece – to strike up conversation.

She said she was talking to a construction worker who was angry about her artwork – and she was able to explain its meaning.

“I asked him what he thought it meant and he said, ‘It’s racist.’ And I said, ‘Well, it is racist, it’s about racism. It’s about people hiding their racism behind the flag, behind their patriotism.’ Instantly all of his angry energy dissipated as he had this realization. This is what democracy is. It’s messy business and it requires us to talk with each other.”

The UM professor and artist said she was inspired to create the piece after watching people walking with American and Nazi flags during the protests in Charlottesville, Va.

“I just thought, that’s what needs to be protested—that the American flag is positioned in between those two symbols of hatred and racism,” she said. “If there was ever a time to show this work, it’s now.”

While the university said it supports “artistic expression and freedom of speech,” UM officials acknowledge that this is an off-campus gallery that wasn’t pre-approved or reviewed by the administration.

UM hopes that “conservations can happen in ways that are respectful of all points of view,” UM wrote in a statement to Fox News. “The university acknowledges that this installation will provoke a range of reactions, including offense at the use of the American Flag and use of the KKK and Nazi symbols. Art exhibits that provoke reaction and conversation are not new, nor the unique province of the University of Miami.”

UNIVERSITIES ISSUE GUIDES, THREATS, AND COUNSELING FOR ‘OFFENSIVE’ HALLOWEEN COSTUMES

Lynn told the Miami New Times she is “from Louisiana, and the Klan is really strong there. I am from the place where these people live. I am these people in some way.”

She finds her artwork offensive and hopes to “awaken citizens to the danger of confusing bigotry with patriotism.”

As a former Girl Scout, who was taught never to let the American flag touch the ground, Lynn told the university publication it wasn’t easy for her to create the artwork.

“It was very painful for me to cut the flag to make it into that shape. But I think that’s what’s happening, the country is in pain,” she told UM News, adding, “I don’t want the American flag to be taken as a symbol for white supremacy, and I think that is what’s happening and that’s a dark path to go down.”",Miami art professor turns American flags into KKK hoods causing outrage,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/30/miami-art-professor-turns-american-flags-into-kkk-hoods-causing-outrage.html

With the Dodgers three innings from falling into a deep deficit, the rookie slugger sparked a late comeback that stopped the Houston Astros' surge.

Hitless in 13 at-bats, Bellinger doubled and scored the tying run in the seventh inning, then doubled home the go-ahead run off struggling closer Ken Giles in a five-run ninth that lifted Los Angeles to a 6-2 win Saturday night and tied the Series at two games apiece.

George Springer put the Astros ahead with a two-out homer in the sixth, the first hit off Los Angeles starter Alex Wood. The crowd at Minute Maid Park, where the Astros had been 7-0 this postseason, was revved up in anticipation of the Astros having a chance to win the first title in their 56-season history on Sunday.

Instead, the Series will go back to Los Angeles no matter what. Clayton Kershaw starts Game 5 for the Dodgers on Sunday night and Dallas Keuchel for the Astros in a rematch of the opener, when Kershaw pitched Los Angeles to a 3-1 win.

Bellinger, a 22-year-old bopper who set a National League rookie record with 39 home runs this season, struck out four times in Game 3 and once more in the fifth inning — his eighth whiff of the Series.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed faith Friday night in Bellinger and again Saturday afternoon.

Bellinger doubled over left fielder Marwin Gonzalez, chasing starter Charlie Morton, and came home on Logan Forsythe's two-out single off Will Harris.

Giles entered to start the ninth and got into immediate trouble, allowing a leadoff single to Corey Seager and a walk to Justin Turner. Bellinger took a low slider, then lined a fastball at the letters to left-center. He raised a hand rounding first and clapped his hands half a dozen times in excitement after sliding into second.

Joe Musgrove relieved and allowed Austin Barnes' sacrifice fly and Joc Pederson's three-run homer, his second home run of the Series.

Wood, Brandon Morrow, winner Tony Watson and Kenley Jansen combined on a two-hitter. Jansen allowed Alex Bregman's two-out homer in the ninth, the 14th home run of the Series.

She reiterated the department's view that the lawsuit was premature because the Pentagon was still in the process of reviewing how the transgender policy might evolve.

One of the attorneys handling the lawsuit, Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the ruling was an enormous relief to his clients.

""Their lives have been devastated since Trump first tweeted he was reinstating the ban,"" Minter said. ""They are now able to serve on equal terms with everyone else.""

Trump announced on Twitter in July that the government ""will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military."" He followed with an August memo directing the Pentagon to extend indefinitely a ban on transgender individuals joining the military, and gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis six months to come up with a policy on ""how to address"" those who are currently serving.

Under the Obama administration, the Department of Defense had announced in 2016 that service members could not be discharged solely based on their gender identity. Transgender individuals were to be allowed to enlist in the military in June 2017, a timeline initially delayed under the Trump administration to Jan. 1, 2018.

Minter said the new court ruling means they will be able to enlist as of that date.

The Trump administration had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit; Kollar-Kotelly refused to do so, and Minter said it's possible the case will go to trial.

One issue not directly addressed in Monday's ruling was whether federal funds should be used to pay for sexual reassignment surgeries for members of the military. The administration has sought to prohibit such payments; Kollar-Kotelly said she didn't have jurisdiction to rule on the issue because none of the plaintiffs in the case established a likelihood of being impacted by that prohibition.

The lawsuit was filed in August by the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) on behalf of eight transgender individuals, including service members in the Air Force, Coast Guard and the Army, as well as students at the U.S. Naval Academy and in the ROTC program at the University of New Haven.

The Justice Department, in seeking the lawsuit's dismissal, said none of the plaintiffs had established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service.

The two advocacy groups who filed the lawsuit assailed that assertion. They highlighted the uncertainty facing Regan Kibby, the transgender Naval Academy student who -- because of Trump's action -- was unsure whether he would be able to join the Navy on graduation.

Kollar-Kotelly said the plaintiffs clearly established that they would be harmed by the administration's directives. She also contended that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in arguing that the directives were unconstitutionally discriminatory -- targeting transgender people without evidence that their service caused substantive problems for the military.

The directives ""do not appear to be supported by any facts,"" the judge wrote.

Other lawsuits challenging president's directive have been filed in Seattle and Baltimore.

Oral arguments are scheduled Nov. 9 for the Baltimore lawsuit, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of six transgender service members.

""The federal courts are recognizing what everyone already knows to be true: President Trump's impulsive decision to ban on transgender people from serving in the military service was blatantly unconstitutional,"" said Joshua Block, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's LGBT & HIV Project.

The Pentagon has not released data on the number of transgender people currently serving, but a Rand Corp. study has estimated between 1,320 and 6,630, out of 1.3 million active-duty troops.",DC court bars Trump from reversing transgender troops policy,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/30/dc-court-bars-trump-from-reversing-transgender-troops-policy.html

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Senior U.S. national security officials say a new war authorization is ""not legally required"" to conduct combat operations against terrorist groups.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testified Monday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, three months after they informed the panel a post-Sept. 11, 2001, law gave the military ample authority to fight terrorist groups and a new one was unnecessary.

A separate authorization for the war in Iraq approved by Congress in 2002 also remains in force.

Tillerson and Mattis say that if Congress does pursue a new authorization for foes such as the Islamic State, it's imperative that the existing law not be rescinded until the new one is fully in place.

But Tillerson will say that if Congress does pursue a new authorization, it's imperative that the 2001 law that currently authorizes U.S. troops to fight terrorist groups not be rescinded until the new authorization is fully in place.

A State Department official says Tillerson will also emphasize that any new war authorization, like the existing one, should not have any geographic or time restrictions placed on the use of force. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the arguments ahead of the hearing and requested anonymity.

Sen. Ben Cardin in particular has pushed for restrictions to be built into any replacement resolution. Cardin is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are testifying on Monday.

A Democratic senator says the ambush in Niger that killed four American soldiers underscores the need for Congress to urgently approve a new war authorization.

Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware says the United States has ""gone far afield"" from the scope of the 2001 authorization that passed shortly after Sept. 11 and sanctioned operations against al-Qaida.

During an appearance on CNN, Coons says most members of Congress weren't even in office when the authorization for the use of military force was signed into law by former President George W. Bush.

Coons says it would have been difficult to imagine 16 years ago that U.S. soldiers would be killed in West Africa by Islamic State militants ""based on an attack that was launched in 2001 from Afghanistan thousands of miles away.""

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday. They told the panel behind closed doors three months ago that a 2001 law gave the military ample authority to fight terrorist groups.

He’s often photographed with a massive grin and interacting with factory workers.

The leader visited Pyongyang Chidren’s Foodstuff Factory in 2014 wearing a large furry hat and lab coat while holding a package of food. Another visit in 2015 had him giggling in front of a glass case of packaged food.

The leader’s visit to Kumkop General Foodstuff Factory for Sportspersons came after the facility went through a complete renovation, KCNA reported. The state-run news agency added Kim was “pleased” that production was occurring on a “highly intensive basis.""

August 2014: Kim at a lubricant factory

The leader was all smiles while watching an unknown substance squeeze out of a machine and into a blue canister at the Chonji Lubricant Factory. Kim reportedly praised factory employees for their work and thanked them for producing a product North Korea previously imported. He called for “steadily improving technical specifications” to improve “international competitiveness.”

August 2014: Kim at hosiery factory

Kim gave some “field guidance” at Pyongyang Hosiery Factory and was seen talking to workers as they stood in front of a wall of colorful socks. The North Korean despot made the visit because he was reportedly deeply “concerned” about “consumer goods for people’s life,” Yonhap News Agency reported.

""The production capacity of the factory is very big, he noted, calling for operating all production processes in full capacity so as to meet the demands of people for hosiery,"" KCNA said in its statement.

2014 to 2015: Kim at Pyongyang Baby Home and Orphanage

Kim's first visit to the orphanage was in 2014, when the facility was under construction. Kim returned the next year to a new building filled with bright-colored furniture. He is seen laughing as he played with children and toys. Another photo showed a hoard of toddlers coming toward Kim.

September 2017: Kim at a farm

Kim gave more “field guidance” during a visit to Farm No. 1116, strolling through a field of unknown plants and then picking up a vegetable and inspecting the quality of it. He was also pictured marveling at apples in an orchard.

Kim and his wife visited Ryuwon Footwear Factory in early October. This was the first time his wife was spotted in public in months.

Kim visited the remodeled Pyongyang Cosmetics Factory and was “very pleased” with the products, which were aimed to make North Korean women “more beautiful.”

The Trump presidency has been consumed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s efforts to uncover collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Mr. Mueller reportedly has secured one or more indictments that he will announce Monday. Some Republicans now seek a new special counsel to investigate if the Clinton Campaign “colluded” with Russians to smear Candidate Trump, along with other aspects of the Clintons’ relationship with Russia and Russian nationals. But one special counsel already is one too many.

During the 1980s and ’90s, American politics was repeatedly distorted, and lives devastated, through the appointment of independent counsels under the post-Watergate Ethics in Government Act. These constitutionally anomalous prosecutors were given unlimited time and resources to investigate officials, including President Clinton, and scandals, such as Iran-Contra. Once appointed, almost all independent counsels built little Justice Departments of their own and set out to find something—anything—to prosecute. Hardly anyone lamented the expiration of this pernicious law in 1999.

But special counsels, appointed by the attorney general and in theory subject to Justice Department oversight, haven’t proved any better in practice. Mr. Mueller’s investigation has already morphed into an open-ended inquiry. It is examining issues—like Donald Trump’s private business transactions—that are far removed from the Russian question. It also has expanded its focus beyond the original question of collusion with the Russians to whether anyone involved in the Russia investigation has committed some related offense. That is evident from investigators’ efforts to interview White House aides who were not involved in the 2016 campaign, and from leaks suggesting that Mr. Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey might have “obstructed” justice.","Begging Your Pardon, Mr. President: How Trump Can Shut Down the Special Counsel Probe",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/30/begging-your-pardon-mr-president-how-trump-can-shut-down-special-counsel-probe#commenting

In making the announcement, Scott said, “As FOX & Friends continues to mark its most-watched year in network history, we are thrilled to give our viewers more of the morning franchise they love.”

FOX & Friends FIRST is presented prior to the network’s signature morning show, previewing the day ahead by covering the latest news headlines in politics, business, entertainment and health. The early morning program is the number one cable news program in its timeslot, dominating CNN and MSNBC in both total viewers and the 25-54 demographic.

On pace to have its highest-rated year in network history, FOX & Friends has been FNC’s signature morning program for more than 19 years. Co-hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, the show has eclipsed the competition for 190 consecutive months.

During her tenure, she served as an anchor of America’s News HQ from 2011 to 2013, as well as helped launch FOX & Friends FIRST, where she has been a co-host for nearly five years. Prior to joining FNC, Childers served as a weekday evening anchor for News 14 Carolina (YNN 14) in Charlotte, NC. She was also a weekend evening anchor and weekday reporter for WLOS-TV (ABC 13) in Asheville, NC and a weekday anchor for WFLX-TV (FOX 29) in Albany, GA. Childers began her career as a producer at WCNC-TV (NBC 22) in Charlotte, NC. She graduated from the University of North Carolina with a B.A. in English.

Jillian Mele joined FNC from Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia (CSN Philly) in March 2017. While with CSN Philly, she earned an Emmy Award for her co-host role on the local morning news program, Breakfast on Broad. Earlier in her career, Mele spent seven years with WCAU-TV (NBC 10) in Philadelphia, PA and reported in various capacities, including as a news, sports and traffic reporter. She got her on-air start as a local news anchor for stations in Presque Isle, Maine, and Binghamton, NY. Mele received a B.A. in arts and communication from La Salle University.

Rob Schmitt was named a weekend news anchor and general assignment reporter at FNC in June 2016 and has served as a substitute anchor for various programs including FOX & Friends First, and FOX Report. Prior to joining FNC, he was an anchor for WNBC-TV (NBC 4) in New York, helming the 12 Noon News while also contributing reports to the 5PM/ET and 6PM/ET news programs. Before joining WNBC-TV, Schmitt worked as an anchor and reporter for CBS2/KCAL9 (CBS) in Los Angeles, CA, and began his career at WPLG-TV (ABC) in Miami, FL.

NEWARK, N.J. — The judge in the bribery trial of U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez and a wealthy friend is facing a decision on a motion for a mistrial.

Attorneys for both defendants filed papers with the court on Sunday.

They alleged that U.S. District Judge William Walls has abused his discretion by stopping them from calling certain witnesses or introducing certain evidence they feel would let them adequately present their case, while allowing prosecutors more leeway.

“The Court’s evidentiary rulings and comments throughout this trial evince a cumulative abuse of discretion that has deprived Defendants of their Fifth and Sixth Amendments rights to a fair trial, to an adequate defense, and to confront the witnesses against them,” they wrote.

The “Watch What Happens Live” host is denying every accusation that the comedian levied against him.

As previously reported, Griffin released a 17-minute video called “Kathy Griffin: A Hell Of A Story,” in which she took Cohen to task for allegedly being a “miserable boss.” She followed up the video with a tweet insisting that he treated her “like a dog” and called him “deeply misogynistic.”

Additionally, she revealed that Cohen allegedly offered her cocaine both times she appeared on his show, just before they went out on stage.

“I am completely stunned by this story. It’s 100% false and totally made up,” Cohen wrote on Twitter soon after the video came out.

While Griffin seems to be the aggressor in this story, it was Cohen who issued the first public diss when reporters with TMZ asked him about the recent news that he’ll be replacing Kathy Griffin alongside Anderson Cooper for CNN’s ""New Year’s Eve Live” show.

“Who?” he said to reporters, pretending to be unfamiliar with Griffin. “I don’t know her.”

Cohen was one of the executives overseeing Griffin’s former Bravo reality show, “My Life on the D-List.” As People notes, she took issue with Cohen and the network’s handling of the show.

“The whole time I was working there, I didn’t know how Andy Cohen wanted to be me… I didn’t know Andy Cohen was on the red carpet, trying to be funny and asking questions on BravoTV.com,” she said.

Only five days ago, Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiava were rescued from their storm-battered sailboat after being discovered adrift by a Taiwanese fishing crew about 900 miles southeast of Japan, the Associated Press reported.

A U.S. Navy ship later retrieved the two women and transported them to the White Beach Naval Facility in Okinawa.

“When I saw the gray ship on the horizon, I was just shaking,” Appel said upon arriving in Okinawa, according to the New York Post. “I was ready to cry, I was so happy. I knew we were going to live.”

WORLD'S LARGEST CRUISE SHIP WILL HAVE SEVEN 'NEIGHBORHOODS'

But even after the ordeal, the women are reportedly planning to set out again next year in the hopes of touring the destinations they were unable to visit this time around, NBC News reported.

“We still never got to see the 20,000 islands [of the South Pacific], so I think that would be the most fantastic trip for May of next spring,” Appel said.

Appel and Fuiava — along with their two dogs, Zeus and Valentine — had originally set out in May from Honolulu, with plans for an 18-day voyage to Tahiti.

Along the way, however, the engine failed and their mast sustained damage, leaving them drifting aimlessly in the Pacific. The women said they hoped a friend and frequent deep-sea fisherman might be able to hear their distress calls or see their emergency flares.

At one point, the two say they were only a little over 700 miles from Oahu, but couldn’t make it back to Hawaii.

They spent the next three months drifting until the Taiwanese fishing vessel spotted them and attempted to tow their sailboat. When that didn’t work, Appel used a surfboard to paddle to their vessel and call for help.

The USS Ashland, which was only about 100 miles away, was dispatched to help. Upon arriving, Cmdr. Steve Wasson said the women’s boat was too damaged to repair, and brought them aboard instead.

At the time of their rescue, the women say they had already exhausted 90 percent of their supplies, despite bringing enough for about six months. Their 50-foot sailboat — named The Sea Nymph — was abandoned in the Pacific.

Appel and Fuiava, however, have since said they would like to rebuild the Sea Nymph if it’s ever found. If not, they’ll set out on another “unsinkable” boat, equipped with the “knowledge that we’ve acquired during these months.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee three months after they informed the panel the post-Sept. 11, 2001 law gave the military ample authority to fight terrorist groups and a new one was unnecessary.

A separate authorization for the war in Iraq approved by Congress in 2002 also remains in force.

The two men said if Congress does pursue a new authorization for foes such as Islamic State militants, it's imperative the existing law not be rescinded until a new one is fully in place. Tillerson and Mattis also said that any new war authorization, like the existing one, should not have any geographic or time restrictions so as not to tip the enemy off.

""Though a statement of continued congressional support would be welcome, a new (war authorization) is not legally required to address the continuing threat posed by al-Qaida, the Taliban and ISIS,"" Mattis said. But doing away with existing laws prematurely ""could only signal to our enemies and our friends that we are backing away from this fight.""

Their appearance before the committee comes as the deadly ambush in Niger is igniting a push among many lawmakers to update the legal parameters for combat operations overseas.

A growing number of congressional Republicans and Democrats, many of whom were startled by the depth of the U.S. commitment in Niger and other parts of Africa, have been demanding a new authorization for the use of military force. They've argued that the dynamics of the battlefield have shifted over the past 16 years and it's past time to replace the post-Sept. 11 authorization to fight al-Qaida with a law that reflects current threats.

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., highlighted the fact that none of the 21 members of the committee were members of the Senate when the 2001 war authorization was approved. Flake and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., are sponsoring legislation for a new war authority for operations against the Islamic State group, al-Qaida and the Taliban.

Flake said he understood the reluctance expressed by Mattis and Tillerson not to telegraph when U.S. troops might depart a particular war zone. But he said that concern is ""overwhelmed in a big way by not having Congress buy in, and us not having skin in the game.""

""It simply allows us to criticize the administration, Republican or Democrat, if we don't like what they're doing because we haven't weighed in,"" Flake said.

Kaine said last week he believed most Americans would be surprised by the extent of the operations in Africa that U.S. forces are involved.

""I don't think Congress has necessarily been completely kept up to date and the American public, I think, certainly has not,"" Kaine said after leaving a classified briefing conducted by senior Pentagon officials on the assault in Niger.

Roughly 800 U.S. service members are in Niger as part of a French-led mission to defeat the extremists in West Africa. There are hundreds more American forces in other African countries.

U.S. troops also are battling an enemy — Islamic State militants — that didn't exist 16 years ago in a country — Syria — that the U.S. didn't expect to be fighting in. Nor did the 2001 authorization anticipate military confrontations with the Syrian government. Trump in April ordered the firing of dozens of Tomahawk missiles at an air base in central Syria and American forces in June shot down a Syrian Air Force fighter jet.

Beyond that, Trump approved a troop increase in Afghanistan, the site of America's longest war, and the U.S. backs a Saudi Arabia-led coalition carrying out airstrikes in Yemen.

But previous attempts to ditch the old authorization and force Congress to craft a new one have failed. Democrats in the House complained that Speaker Paul Ryan used underhanded tactics after an amendment was stripped from a military spending bill that would have repealed the 2001 war authorization 240 days after the bill was enacted. Proponents of the measure said eight months was enough time to approve new war authority.

GOP leaders said voting to rescind existing war authority without a replacement in hand risks leaving U.S. troops and commanders in combat zones without the necessary legal authority they need to carry out military operations.

A similar effort in the Senate led by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also came up well short. Paul, a member of the committee and a leader of the GOP's noninterventionist wing, has accused his colleagues of surrendering their war-making power to the White House.

Podesta and his lobbying firm were subjects of a federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

The Podesta Group was one of several firms that worked on a campaign called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. The campaign was led by Paul Manafort and promoted Ukraine’s image in the West.

Manafort, who served as President Trump's campaign manager for a period last summer, was indicted Friday by Mueller's team for several charges dating back to his work in Ukraine.

According to Politico, which first reported the story, Podesta will be handing over full operational and financial control to the company’s CEO Kimberly Fritts.

In an email to his staff, Podesta reportedly said he was stepping down because he ""needs to fight this as an individual, but doesn't want the firm to fight it,"" a person familiar with the farewell speech said.

Dubbed on of DC’s “50 heavy lifters” by the Financial Times and one of “Washington’s biggest players” by The New York Times, Podesta turned his once-modest lobbying firm into a heavy hitter.

But in the wake of the Mueller investigation the Podesta Group has struggled. About a half dozen of its clients have cut ties with the firm this year.

That is the first Halloween I remember the hum of petrified parents. It was the first time we didn’t get to go trick or treating, no not even one street over. Instead, we had a makeshift party at a neighbor’s house. The TV news turned on low warned of tainted Tylenol.

The next year was the first time we took our candy to the police station to be X-rayed to check for needles and razor blades. We heard the adults whisper: “What is the world coming to?”

We didn’t know, but I thought as police checked out my candy: “Easy with that full-size Snickers you’re manhandling!”

As an adult with children ranging in age from 3 to 22, I have seen just about everything in the ways of Halloween. From the politically incorrect to the religiously correct to the “yeah, just give us some freaking candy,” everyone has an opinion.

And every year there is some new rule or renegade rant about all the souls that have come and gone, and may or may not stop by for some creepy punch served over dry ice. Dry ice, by the way, is very dangerous when handled with bare hands.

As I watched volunteers wander into the haunted house at my daughter’s school, I noted that 35 years ago those costumes would have sent me to counseling. My husband whimpered and covered the eyes of our 5-year-old as a cheerleader with high-def cosmetics entered, carrying what was supposed to be her own head under one arm.

Everything is more terrifying now, in make-believe and in real life.

In real life, gunmen take people out with high-powered rifles at concerts, and bad guys put poison and needles in caramel apples. But that is the minority. I refuse to believe it is the majority or the rule.

In the infamous words of Linus in Charles Schultz’s “The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown”:

“There are three things I've learned never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin.”

When it comes to Halloween, there are some who will lock themselves away in fear of what might happen, or to nurse their wounds because of what did happen. There are some who lock themselves away in protest.

There are others who call it something else, like a fest or a carnival so as not to offend or beckon souls. Still, others will go too far, making some crude political statement or dressing their toddler like a French maid or Monica Lewinsky.

And in this game called Halloween, all that is necessary for us to have something for us to talk about next year. Some grand opinion, some horrific worry, some hill to die on, or some great offense that rocks us to our core and gets us out of bed to write that letter, so that we might be heard.

I find myself wishing I was sitting in a pumpkin patch with Linus, a sheet over my head, never mind the thread count, two holes cut out for eyes. I make no statement with this sheet. I courageously eat unwrapped Rice Krispies that the neighbor dropped in my bucket. I don’t care how she voted in the last election. I wait patiently for something magical to happen, less publicized and political than Santa.

Spacey said he has had relationships with both men and women throughout his life and chooses “now to live as a gay man.”

Musk is starting with a route to Los Angeles, from SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, throughout the rest of the city, one which is considered the most congested in the continental U.S.

ELON MUSK SHOWS OFF BORING COMPANY ELEVATOR FOR THE FIRST TIME

In 2016, Drivers in LA spent on average 81 hours in traffic, according to a story in The Los Angeles Times, which obtained the survey from data company Inrix.

In a separate tweet, Musk added that that the tunnel is 500 feet so far, but should be ""2 miles long in three or four months and hopefully stretch the whole 405 N-S corridor from [Los Angeles International Airport] LAX to the 101 in a year or so.""

In August, The Boring Company received approval by the city of Hawthorne (a city in southwestern Los Angeles County) to build the tunnel. The tunnel operates using electric skates, so that cars can move along swiftly.

In July, Musk showed off the elevator that would take cars from the congested roads to the underground network of tunnels.

In addition to the tunnel under LA, The Boring Company is also looking to have tunnels in other cities, including one stretching from Baltimore to New York (stopping in Washington and Philadelphia), as well as Chicago and other U.S. cities.

In addition to being CEO of The Boring Company, Musk is also the CEO of electric vehicle company Tesla, space exploration company SpaceX. He also co-founded artificial intelligence specialists Neuralink and OpenAI.

Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and his associate, Richard Gates, were required to turn themselves into federal authorities Monday as they were indicted on 12 counts – ranging from conspiracy against the U.S., to conspiracy to launder money.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office also revealed Monday that George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to the FBI about his connections with Russian officials.

Early problems

Before Trump ever took office, tens of thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee and other officials connected to former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton were leaked.

Those emails – released in July 2016 ahead of the Democratic National Convention – purportedly showed the party favoring Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and led to the resignation of party chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

But more than just ousting Wasserman Schultz, intelligence officials concluded that those responsible for leaking the emails were connected to the Russian government. In its assessment of the hack, the CIA concluded that Russia intervened in the election in order to help Trump secure the presidency.

MUELLER’S RUSSIA PROBE: WHAT TO KNOW

Before he handed over the White House to Trump, former President Barack Obama sanctioned Russia for its alleged involvement in the election – a move that would eventually come back to dismantle one of Trump’s senior aides.

Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also got the administration into hot water for his own actions during the campaign.

Trump Jr. confirmed in July 2017 that he took a meeting with a Russian lawyer during the campaign as she was supposed to have damaging information about Clinton.

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” an email about the meeting said in part.

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.""

Trump Jr. maintained that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, did not have any information to share and instead wanted to discuss other matters, such as the Magnitsky Act and other sanctions.

TRUMP ORGANIZATION EXEC EMAILED PUTIN'S PRESS SECRETARY FOR HELP ON MOSCOW PROJECT

Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, were at the meeting as well. The two are also being investigated.

Flynn’s fall

Michael Flynn’s tenure as Trump’s national security adviser was short but rife with controversy that still bedevils the administration. But Flynn didn’t come without a warning.

Only a few days after the November election, Obama met with Trump to share his concerns about Flynn, a retired lieutenant general. Flynn had served under Obama as head of military intelligence until he was fired in 2014 following reports of insubordination and questionable management style.

Still, Trump ignored Obama’s apparent apprehensions and selected Flynn as his national security adviser. Not a month later, Trump accepted Flynn’s resignation.

HOW IS JARED KUSHNER LINKED TO RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION?

As Obama issued the sanctions on Russia for its involvement in the election, Flynn reportedly called the Russian ambassador to discuss the move. Flynn initially denied speaking to the ambassador, but when intelligence officials revealed proof, he said he just didn’t remember speaking on that topic.

Flynn resigned under harsh scrutiny for misleading the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his ties to and conversations with Russian officials.

He remains under multiple investigations by congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general. Mueller has included Flynn in his probe, and his investigators are reportedly trying to determine if he was secretly paid by the Turkish government during the campaign, the New York Times reported in August.

Flynn registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department in March 2017.

Firing the FBI director

Trump sacked FBI Director James Comey on May 9 – less than two months after Comey publicly proclaimed that the agency was investigating ties between Russia and Trump’s campaign.

The White House maintained that Comey was relieved from his duties due to his handling of the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure of secretary of state. But days later, Trump alluded that he had considered the Russian investigation when he fired Comey.

RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SERGEI KISLYAK, AT CENTER OF ELECTION CONTROVERSY, CONCLUDES ASSIGNMENT

Comey told a Senate intelligence committee in June that he was concerned about the “shifting explanations” that came from the White House regarding his firing.

He also claimed that Trump had asked for the FBI to drop its investigation into Flynn during a February meeting. The White House has denied that Trump was attempting to influence the FBI director.

Before the committee, Comey confirmed that he had reassured Trump repeatedly that he was not under investigation by the FBI.

Russians in the Oval

In the wake of Comey’s dismissal, the Trump administration was rocked with reports of the president’s own controversial dealings with Russian officials in the Oval Office.

The Washington Post reported on May 15 that Trump shared classified information regarding ISIS threats with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador at the time. The information was reportedly given to the U.S. from Israel and not meant to be shared.

Later that week, the New York Times reported that Trump told those officials the day after firing Comey – who he allegedly called a “nut job” – that the personnel change took “great pressure” off of him.

Special counsel called

The Department of Justice announced the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the federal investigation into Russia’s alleged influence on the election on May 17.

The appointment followed a growing Democratic outcry for someone outside the Justice Department to handle the probe.

TRUMP SAYS SESSIONS ‘SHOULD NEVER HAVE RECUSED HIMSELF’ FROM RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

Mueller was given wide berth to carry out his investigation, and he expanded the probe to look into whether Trump obstructed justice with Comey’s firing.

Trump has criticized Mueller’s friendship with Comey as “very bothersome.” The two were former colleagues at the Justice Department.

Mueller has reportedly impaneled a grand jury to continue the investigation. A grand jury gives prosecutors the ability to subpoena documents and gather on-the-record witness testimonies. It doesn’t necessarily mean criminal charges will be sought.

Trump faces Putin

Trump finally met with Putin for the first time face-to-face at the G-20 summit in June.

He immediately pressed his Russian counterpart on the allegations of election meddling – which Putin denied, according to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

KELLYANNE CONWAY ON COLLUSION: ‘WHAT’S THE CONCLUSION?’

Lavrov told reporters after the meeting that Trump had accepted Putin’s assurances that Moscow was innocent of interfering in the election.

Trump Tower Moscow

While Trump was actively running for president, his business attempted to secure a new real estate development in Moscow, according to records reviewed by the Washington Post.

The Trump Organization pursued building a Trump Tower in Moscow from late 2015 to early 2016, according to the paper. And Russian-born real estate developer Felix Sater was hoping to bring Trump himself to the country.

Sater reportedly urged Trump to come to Moscow to promote the business venture and promised that he could get Putin to say “great things” about the Manhattan business mogul, sources told the Washington Post.

A top executive with Trump's real estate company also emailed Putin's press secretary in 2016 for help to expedite the project, according to an email obtained by Fox News.

""Over the past few months, I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City,"" Michael Cohen, the company's executive vice president and Trump's special counsel at the time, said in a Jan. 14, 2016 email. ""Without getting into lengthy specifics, the communication between our two sides has stalled. As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance.""

Cohen later told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the project was ""similar"" to other business ideas ""contemplated years before any campaign.""

""The Trump Tower Moscow proposal was not related in any way to Mr. Trump's presidential campaign,"" Cohen said.

Trump never went to Russia, and the project was abandoned in January 2016.

Anyone else under investigation?

Manafort resigned as Trump’s campaign manager in August 2016 amid questions regarding his business dealings in Ukraine.

The special counsel has taken over a criminal investigation into Manafort’s financial dealings, which began even before the 2016 election, according to The Associated Press. FBI agents raided Manafort’s Virginia home earlier this year, taking with them documents related to the Russia investigation.

DONALD TRUMP JR. AGREES TO PRIVATE MEETING WITH SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

Manafort has been the subject of multiple investigations into his financial dealings and lobbying work. He has denied any colluding with Russia. Manafort was one of two people charged in the investigation on Oct. 30.

Jared Kushner, too, has been under FBI scrutiny.

Kushner, married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, may possess substantial information relevant to the Russian investigation, officials told NBC in May.

He also held private meetings with lawmakers regarding the controversial meeting Trump Jr. set up with the Russian lawyer. Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, who is leading the House intelligence committee’s probe into Russia’s involvement in the election, said Kushner was “straightforward, forthcoming [and] wanted to answer every question we had.”

Kushner has denied colluding with Russia or knowing anyone who did so.

Social media, too, is the subject of congressional investigations as Facebook, Twitter and Google executives have said advertisements linked to Russian operatives were bought during the election.

Facebook said about $100,000 in ad purchases connected to “inauthentic accounts” that violated its policies were uncovered as well as another $50,000 on “potentially politically related ad spending” that were in Russian. Twitter said a group with “strong links to the Russian government” spent $274,000 in ads, and the social media site suspended almost two dozen accounts that were possibly linked to Russian officials.

As for Google, Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Google Search products and Gmail regarding the election, Fox Business reported.

Others were quick to point out how the rest of the emoji industry makes its burgers, with some offering large diagrams that only seemed to add fuel to the fire.

Baekdal himself noted that he’s been studying YouTube to see how top chefs stack their burgers, only to find that there’s no standard to which they adhere.

In any case, Google CEO Pichai claims the company will “address on Monday” the concerns raised by Twitter. He also asked for the Internet’s collective help in coming to a consensus about the correct order of burger toppings.

Baekdal, meanwhile, has said he plans to turn his attention away from the burger debate and shift back to “media analysist mode.”

""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" Mattis said.
Read on for a brief look at how North Korea’s nuclear weapons program has grown throughout the regimes in the past century.
In the beginning of his reign — he was North Korea’s supreme leader from 1994 to 2011 — North Korea denied that it had a nuclear weapons program.
JAPAN WARNS NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR THREAT AT ‘UNPRECEDENTED, CRITICAL’ LEVELHowever, in 2003, Pyongyang announced that North Korea was withdrawing from the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which barred the nation from making nuclear weapons.","The threat of nuclear missile attack by North Korea is accelerating, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Saturday.

""North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs,"" he said, adding that U.S.-South Korean military and diplomatic collaboration thus has taken on ""a new urgency.""

""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" Mattis said.

Mattis made his remarks in Seoul alongside South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo. He pledged that the U.S. would repel any strike, adding that North Korea is overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance.

""Make no mistake — any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is effective and overwhelming,"" Mattis added.

However, he also said that diplomacy is still the preferred way to deal with the North. Mattis' comments come after a Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera recently said North Korea’s threat of nuclear war is now at an “unprecedented” level.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have engaged in a war of words that has only escalated over the past few months. Trump has nicknamed Kim “Rocket Man;” the North Korean leader has called Trump “deranged.”

The U.S. and its allies are on alert since North Korea tested intercontinental missiles in the Pacific near Japan and Guam, a highly strategic U.S. territory. Pyongyang conducted its longest-ever ballistic missile test flight last month.

And North Korea has previously warned other countries that participating in military actions with the U.S. could result in retaliation, especially as a “nuclear war may break any moment.”

“Unless the hostile policy and the nuclear threat of the U.S. is thoroughly eradicated, we will never put our nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets on the negotiation table under any circumstance,” North Korea ambassador Kim In Ryong reportedly told a United Nations disarmament committee.

Since Kim took over North Korea in 2011, it has rapidly expanded and tested its missile arsenal with weapons capable of striking the U.S. mainland. His end goal, he has reportedly said, is to ""establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military options” for the North.

Read on for a brief look at how North Korea’s nuclear weapons program has grown throughout the regimes in the past century.

Kim Il Sung, leader from 1948-1994

Kim Il Sung can be credited with founding North Korea and propelling the nation’s nuclear program forward — but he did not live to see his country conduct its first nuclear test.

It was under the first Kim that North Korea began to build up its nuclear reactors. And it was under his leadership that the nation began the Korean War — surely a catalyst that led the leader to believe his nation needed nuclear weapons, Dr. Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor of Korean Studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, told Fox News in an interview.

TRUMP’S COMMENTS ON NORTH KOREA, FROM ‘FIRE AND FURY’ TO BLAMING CHINA

“The seeds of nuclear aspirations were sown in the Korean War,” Lee said.

The Korean War pitted North Korea and its ally China — two nations that did not have nuclear capabilities at the time — against a nuclear-armed U.S., making it “clear to the first Kim that nuclear weapons are very powerful, a powerful deterrent,” Lee said.

Kim Jong Il, leader from 1994-2011

When the second leader of the Kim dynasty died in 2011, Kim Jong Il was remembered as the “dictator who turned North Korea into a nuclear state,” in his New York Times obituary.

And it’s Kim Jong Il that really “gets the credit of taking the country down the nuclear path,"" Lee said.

In the beginning of his reign — he was North Korea’s supreme leader from 1994 to 2011 — North Korea denied that it had a nuclear weapons program.

JAPAN WARNS NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR THREAT AT ‘UNPRECEDENTED, CRITICAL’ LEVEL

However, in 2003, Pyongyang announced that North Korea was withdrawing from the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which barred the nation from making nuclear weapons.

By 2005, North Korea confirmed that it had its own nuclear weapons. It tested its first nuclear device in 2006.

Kim Jong Un, leader from 2011-present

Kim Jong Un is credited with accelerating North Korea’s push for nuclear weapons, and under the Obama administration, many of the world’s attitudes toward the East Asian nation’s nuclear capabilities became less blasé than in the past, Lee said.

And Kim Jong Un recently crossed a major threshold for his country this summer — the ability to credibly threaten the U.S. with an intercontinental ballistic missile.

NORTH KOREA CELEBRATES NUCLEAR TESTS

North Korea last month successfully tested its longest-ever flight of a ballistic missile. The intermediate-range weapon traveled 3,700 miles and passed over Japan before it landed in the Pacific. Earlier this month, the country also tested its most powerful nuclear test to date.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis condemned the test and said it caused “millions of Japanese” to “duck and cover.” Mattis also said the U.S. and Japan are ready for potential future missile threats.

After the missile test, Kim Jong Un said North Korea is nearing “equilibrium” with the U.S. in terms of its military force.

The increasingly frequent and aggressive tests have added to outside fears that North Korea is closer than ever to building a military arsenal that could viably target the mainland of the U.S. or its allies in Asia.

Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” in his speech to the U.N. last month and said the dictator is on a “suicide mission for himself and for his regime.”

“The United States has great strength and patience,” Trump said. “But if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.”

""The special counsel has found a reason on criminal violations to indict two individuals and I will leave that up to the special counsel to make that determination.
""The president is not firing the special counsel,"" Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, said on CNN Monday.","President Trump fired back on Monday in an attempt to distance his White House from the grand jury indictments of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an aide, noting their crimes were committed “years” before they worked on the campaign.

The president led a chorus of critics of the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, noting that the crimes for which Manafort and his aide, Rick Gates, are charged appear to predate the presidential campaign by years.

“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????” Trump tweeted Monday. “….Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”

Manafort and Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury Friday on 12 counts, including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) statements, false statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts. The indictments were announced Monday.

Mueller’s team also unsealed a guilty plea by former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who admitted to making false statements to FBI agents as part of the investigation. According to court documents, Papadopoulos’ false statements were in regards to his relationship with a Russian ‘professor,’ who had ties to Russian government officials.

The special counsel probe and Russia “hoax,” as the president has described it, has cast a cloud over the Trump administration. But last week, the White House enjoyed a shift in focus, amid new revelations in the controversial Obama-era Uranium One deal and the payments behind the salacious anti-Trump dossier.

Reports last week revealed that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid more than $9 million to law firm Perkins Coie, which commissioned Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research that ultimately led to the now-infamous dossier.

Over the weekend, it was revealed that the conservative Washington Free Beacon website initially funded the opposition research into then-candidate Donald Trump and other GOP contenders for the White House. Lawyers for the Free Beacon told the House Intelligence Committee that the website funded the research between fall 2015 and spring 2016.

TRUMP TWEETS ON REPORTS THAT OBAMA CAMPAIGN PAID LAW FIRM THAT HIRED FUSION GPS

But some Republicans say that the Manafort-Gates indictments provide “no evidence” in the Russian collusion narrative.

Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who has repeatedly called for Mueller’s resignation, over the special counsel’s relationship with former FBI Director James Comey, said the indictment “doesn’t have anything to do with Donald Trump.”

“I believe that Mr. Mueller’s conflict of interest is absolutely incontrovertible, and I think this is further indication he’s headed in this direction no matter what,” Franks said on his local radio station, KTAR-FM Morning News, Monday. “It’s ironic because ostensibly his investigation is supposed to be into Donald Trump’s potential involvement with Russia, yet this doesn’t have anything to do with Donald Trump.”

MUELLER FACING NEW REPUBLICAN PRESSURE TO RESIGN IN RUSSIA PROBE

Franks added: “They may try to parlay it into something to hook President Trump in, but right now, this is par for the course. I should suggest this was kind of predictable.”

Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading its own Russia probe, echoed a similar sentiment.

“This pre-dates the campaign entirely, and could pre-date Paul Manafort even meeting Donald Trump. This has nothing to do with the campaign,” King told Fox News on “America’s Newsroom” Monday. “The investigation still has to go forward but what I’ve seen so far, is there is no evidence at all linking the Trump campaign to Russian influence or collusion.”

The Senate Intelligence Committee is also leading a bipartisan Russia probe, and said that the indictment ""doesn't change"" their investigation.

""The special counsel has found a reason on criminal violations to indict two individuals and I will leave that up to the special counsel to make that determination. It doesn't change anything with our investigation,"" Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C. said in a statement to Fox News. ""We received documents from and had interest in two of the individuals named, but clearly the criminal charges put them in the Special Counsel's purview.""

But Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee said that the indictments are “significant” and a “sobering step” in the special counsel’s investigation.

“That’s why it is imperative that Congress take action now to protect the independence of the Special Counsel, wherever, or however high his investigation may lead,” Warner said in a statement Monday. “Members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, must also make clear to the President that issuing pardons to any of his associates or to himself would be unacceptable and result in immediate, bipartisan action by Congress.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also said that the president “must not, under any circumstances, interfere” with Mueller’s work.

“If he does so, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally, and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues,” Schumer said in a statement Monday.

While Trump has not suggested any plans to interfere with the special counsel investigation, there are currently two pieces of legislation in the Senate, with bipartisan sponsorship, that would ensure a judicial check on the executive branch’s ability to remove a special counsel. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., are behind the bills, along with Democratic senators.

""The president is not firing the special counsel,"" Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, said on CNN Monday.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also said Monday the president has ""no intention or plan to make any changes in regard to Special Counsel.""

Though some argue the indictments are irrelevant to the Trump-Russia collusion narrative, former top-ranking Justice Department official under both Bush and Obama administrations, James Trusty, told Fox News that this is what happens during a broad investigation.

Last week, Mueller expanded his probe to investigate Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta’s dealings with Manafort and a Ukrainian nonprofit. The Podesta Group told Fox News last week they were “cooperating” with the special counsel’s office.

Trusty said last week that Mueller has “a lot of room to legitimately poke around and find information on one party or another.”

“It’s a cliché, but a good cliché –prosecutors go where the evidence leads them,” Trusty told Fox News last week. “When you define the mission broadly, there is a lot of room for [an independent prosecutor’s] exploration.”

Trusty said that if a special counsel’s mission is defined broadly, “it is all fair game if the independent prosecutor is doing his job the right way.”","Trump, GOP lawmakers: Manafort charges no relation to campaign, alleged 'collusion'",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/30/trump-gop-lawmakers-manafort-charges-no-relation-to-campaign-alleged-collusion.html

COURTROOM GASPS AS VIDEO OF KATE STEINLE'S SHOOTING IS PLAYED FOR JURY

Steinle's father testified last week at the trial's opening that before she died, she said to him: ""Help me, Dad.""

The prosecution said those were her last words.

While Garcia's immigration status is what brought the case into the national spotlight, jurors will not hear evidence about that, and it will not be a factor in the trial.

Steinle's slaying became a signature issue for Donald Trump as he was running for president. He invoked the slaying in calling for the construction of a wall on the Mexican border and stepping up deportations and cracking down on illegal immigration.

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

A Missouri college that has long embraced teaching its students about military history is beginning a new, required course on patriotism.

FOX's Gurnal Scott with the story:

The College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri is a private, Christian, liberal arts school that embraces it's uniqueness in how it values getting ""the job"" done:

(Dr. Davis) ""This is a work college. Kids work here. They don't pay tuition. They don't have to do that. We don't make loans and they graduate debt free. We to turn out citizens that will take a leadership role.""

That is why the college's president Dr. Jerry Davis says part of the school's mission has been teaching students about the military and it's importance historically in America. The College of the Ozarks is making that a new course, mandatory for incoming freshmen, called 'Patriotic Education and Fitness':

(Dr. Davis) ""We think that we need to be a little bit more intentional in teaching students about our country and about the military and what they do and why they do it.""

The course will serve to educate students on armed forces customs and protocols and touch on some political principles as well as teaching marksmanship and other survival techniques. It can serve, should a first-year student choose, as a start for reserve officers training or ROTC. Davis who has led the College of the Ozarks for nearly 30 years says Midwestern reverence for the military makes this a great fit within their curriculum:

(Dr. Davis) ""It's a part of our carrying out our patriotic goal and we think, we hope, that other schools will notice that.""

Davis says this concept couldn't come at a better time as controversy continues in stadiums across the nation over patriotism:

(Dr. Davis) ""I regret very much what's going on in the culture with regard to respect for the national anthem. Those are military students that present those colors and by extension. The country is being provided or defended by the military, so you can't say it doesn't involve the military. It does.""

In fact, the school has said its teams won't compete against other athletes that won't stand for the anthem. That's why Davis wants his school to lead the way in teaching respect for the uniform:

(Dr. Davis) ""Patriotism is not inherited by bloodstream. It must be modeled. It must be modeled, it must be taught.""

So what began as a pilot program, is growing at the College of the Ozarks as a nod to those who serve and to America itself.

She said she’s making sure, in the wake of their father’s death, they are physically and emotionally OK.

Special Forces soldier Bryan Black was among four soldiers killed in Niger earlier this month during a mission that remains somewhat unclear. The military is still trying to determine if the soldiers were randomly targeted or if they were led into an overwhelming ambush.

Michelle Black wants the nation to know her husband was more than a Special Forces soldier. He was also a master chess player and avid sportsman, she said, who spoke three languages, including Arabic and the local dialect in Niger, which made him something of a celebrity among his unit. She says most of all, he was an amazing husband and father.

“I know that I married a true hero, whether it would’ve been on the battlefield or just in life in general. When you have true moral integrity and you care that much for other people that you’re willing to put your life on the line,” she said, “you’re a hero whether it’s over there or here.”

Michelle Black said when it comes to the ongoing investigation into her husband’s death, the military is giving her guidance, but she’s not watching the news or following the day-to-day details. Someday, she said, she’ll need answers. But it won’t bring Bryan back.

She also said she was very aware of the controversy surrounding President Trump and his conversation with another Gold Star wife, whose husband was also killed in Niger. But she said her experience with the president was different.

“Any report that Chip and Joanna have sold their farmhouse is completely untrue. They have not sold their home and they do not have any plans to do so,” a rep for the Gaineses told People.

Brock Murphy said the couple did move their property line but were not moving from their home.

‘FIXER UPPER’ STARS CHIP AND JOANNA GAINES: MAJOR MOMENTS YOU SHOULD KNOW

“The Gaines recently moved their property line to match their fence line — this is not uncommon and is a matter of public record —which is likely what triggered this false report,” Murphy said.

Joanna Gaines took to Twitter Thursday to denounce the rumors that began earlier this month after The Blast reported the couple had sold their home for an ""undisclosed amount.""

“We love this place. It’s home, which means more to us than anything! Remember if it didn’t come directly from us it’s probably NOT true,"" Gaines tweeted.

The couple purchased their home in 2012 but could not move in until a year and a half later due to renovations.

This is not the first time the couple has been reportedly considered moving from their Waco home.

In February, Chip and Joanna told the press that they have considered living in different places, including New York City and Las Vegas.

When Vice president Lyndon Baines Johnson accompanied President John F. Kennedy to Dallas in November of 1963, Johnson's long political career seemed to be over. With rumors abounding that Kennedy was going to drop him from the ticket in the upcoming 1964 election, Johnson had resigned himself to returning to a quiet life on his Texas ranch.

Then an assassin's bullet forever changed Lyndon Johnson's political fortune.

In this special biography episode of ""War Stories with Oliver North,"" you'll see how a former Texas school teacher made a rapid ascent through the ranks in Washington to become a political powerhouse. Lady Bird Johnson's home movies will give you a behind-the-scenes look at three decades of her husband's life. Former speech writer Harry Mcpherson reflects on how Johnson pushed sweeping civil rights reforms and dramatically expanded federal social programs through a reluctant congress. And you'll hear how LBJ got what he wanted by using the legendary ""Johnson treatment.""

Johnson's gradual escalation of the war in Vietnam divided the country, overshadowed his domestic policies and forever tainted his administration's accomplishments. Racial violence, political assassinations and growing opposition to the war made the 1960's one of the most tumultuous decades in our nation's history. Former secretary of health, education and welfare Joseph Califano recalls how the weight of trying to lead our country through the chaos took a terrible toll on the man who envisioned America as the ""great society,"" and gives you the inside story on the night LBJ went on national television and shocked the nation.",The Life And Times Of Lyndon Baines Johnson,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/10/10/the-life-and-times-of-lyndon-baines-johnson/

Indeed, Manafort’s indictment can be viewed on two levels.
So the Manafort indictment only makes the entire Russian collusion narrative more murky rather than less.","The news that GOP political fixer Paul Manafort and an associate have been indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on money laundering and conspiracy charges isn’t a stunning surprise. Manafort’s career in Washington was often conducted in and out of the shadows. Now he’s been dragged under a searchlight. Manafort should have known you should be careful what you wish for in politics.

A former political consultant, the 68-year-old Manafort had been out of active politics for over a quarter century. He’d become a sometime lobbyist and political operator with many international clients. But in April, 2016, his old bad boy business partner Roger Stone, a frequent advisor to Donald Trump, helped land him the job of Trump campaign manager. The gig promised to be exciting, would raise Manafort’s profile with his business clients and, hey, Trump was on course to win the GOP nomination and perhaps even the presidency.

Trump did indeed go all the way, but for Manafort the assignment was a disaster. He boasted to reporters he would make Trump “more presidential,” enraging a boss who hates the idea of political handlers.

That was only the beginning of the bad news. Manafort for a decade had business ties to Ukraine, where he did work for Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire oligarch linked to Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin. In July, 2016, Ukrainian sources inside the anti-Putin government there leaked ledgers that showed large cash payments to Manafort in exchange for his work for a pro-Putin political party. Many speculated that Manafort might not have reported all the income.

The Manafort indictment only makes the entire Russian collusion narrative more murky rather than less. Certainly, it is an embarrassment to the Trump White House. But it may ultimately be equally embarrassing for other parties when we learn just how tangled a web Manafort weaved.

Those revelations were the final straw for a campaign that was already under attack for being too ambivalent about Russian misdeeds. The Trump campaign itself was sputtering in mid-August and Manafort was replaced by the triad of Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and David Bossie.

Manafort may have left the campaign, but time bombs he planted while he was there continue to explode around Team Trump. His Ukrainian business dealings included a series of mysterious money transfers from overseas accounts to domestic U.S. businesses like car dealerships. Apparently, those transfers were enough to convince the federal court overseeing U.S. intelligence agencies to being surveillance of Manafort’s office in Trump Tower in New York beginning only a month after he became campaign manager.

An additional reason to continue investigating Manafort arrived in June, 2016 when Manafort, Donald Trump Jr., and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner met with a Russian lawyer with the advertised purpose of sharing damaging information on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Nothing apparently came of the meeting, and the Russian lawyer has since been linked to both the Kremlin and the dirt-digging firm Fusion GPS that commissioned the infamous anti-Trump “Steele” dossier. Could the meeting have been a possible “sting” operation designed to implicate Team Trump in collusion they really never engaged in?

Indeed, Manafort’s indictment can be viewed on two levels. On the one hand, Special Counsel Mueller could be using it to squeeze Manafort for information on Trump higher-ups, perhaps including the president himself. But recent revelations that Manafort frequently worked on Russian-Ukrainian issues with Democratic super-lobbyist Tony Podesta - the brother of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta - raises lots of questions. Podesta’ firm is reportedly under investigation by Mueller’s office for possible failure to report its lobbying activities on behalf of foreign clients.

The news comes after many fans called on Netflix to pull the plug on its original series following a report from Buzzfeed News in which actor Anthony Rapp alleged Spacey, then 26, made a sexual advance on him when he was 14 years old.

The decision to conclude ""House of Cards"" was made several months ago, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the decision.

However, a representitive for Netflix told Fox News earlier on Monday that the company is ""deeply troubled by last night’s news concerning Kevin Spacey.

According to Entertainment Weekly, “House of Cards” recently began filming its sixth season. Several reports said the show was already considering making this season its last.

Rapp said that in 1986, Spacey, a fellow Broadway actor at the time, invited Rapp to his apartment for a party. Later in the evening, Spacey, then 26, allegedly “picked Rapp up, placed him on his bed, and climbed on top of him, making a sexual advance,” according to the Buzzfeed News report.

Rapp recalled he pushed Spacey off of him, went to a bathroom and closed the door, thinking: “What is happening?” He told Spacey he had to go home, to which Spacey allegedly asked if Rapp was “sure” he wanted to do that.

Rapp, who came forward less than a month after accusations against mega-producer Harvey Weinstein led to his Hollywood downfall, said he decided to speak out “not to simply air a grievance … but to try to shine another light on the decades of behavior that have been allowed to continue because many people, including myself, being silent.”

Between 2009 and 2014, all 50 states and the District of Columbia passed concussion laws focused on three core components: mandatory removal from play after a suspected concussion, clearance to return to play from a licensed health professional, and required education of coaches, parents and athletes about concussion symptoms and signs, the study authors note in the American Journal of Public Health online October 19.

BEARS TIGHT END UNDERGOES EMERGENCY SURGERY AFTER GRUESOME LEG INJURY

""The key feature in these laws is focused on secondary prevention - or management of a concussion after it occurs,"" said lead author Dr. Ginger Yang of the Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.

Yang's team analyzed data from High School Reporting Injury Online, looking for new and recurrent concussion rates across nine sports before, during and after laws went into effect.

The researchers analyzed data from 2009 through 2016 on more than 8,000 concussions, which they say are representative of nearly 2.7 million concussions sustained by U.S. high school students during that period.

Overall, about 89 percent were first-time concussions; the rest were recurrences in athletes who'd had concussions in the past.

As expected, there were increases in new concussions after the laws went into effect.

""This is likely due to more people - athletes, athletic trainers, coaches and parents - becoming aware,"" Yang told Reuters Health by email.

The rate of recurrences went down, however. In 2013-2014, recurrent concussions accounted for 14 percent of the total number; in 2014-2015 that went down to 11 percent and in 2015-2016 to 7 percent.

""The decline in recurrent concussion rates is likely the result of the laws' requirements of mandatory removal from play or permission requirements to return to play,"" Yang said.

American football had the highest average annual concussion rate, followed by girls' soccer and boys' wrestling. Males had a higher average annual concussion rate than females, but when comparing the rates in gender-comparable sports such as basketball, soccer, and baseball/softball, females reported almost double the annual rate as males.

""It is possible that girls have higher risk of concussions than boys or are more likely to report injuries,"" Yang said. ""Future studies should look specifically at these disparities.""

Future studies should also compare state laws to understand which language or requirements are the most effective, said Dr. Kerri McGowan Lowrey of the University of Maryland School of Law in Baltimore. Lowrey, who wasn't involved in this study, studies policymaking regarding youth concussion laws.

PARENTS SHARE HEARTBREAKING PHOTOS OF BABY SET TO LOSE LIMBS TO MENINGITIS

""Researchers need to pinpoint which aspects of the laws actually matter,"" she told Reuters Health by email. ""Is it training for coaches? Education for parents or student athletes? What kind of 'education' really works?""

Researchers should also continue to investigate how concussions heal, what the best treatments are and how long until a student athlete can safely return to the playing field, said Dr. Tom Trojian, the lead team physician for Drexel Athletics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who wasn't involved with this study.

On Wednesday, the 100-year-old veteran got his recognition and finally his money, too.

Almeda received the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin also announced at a Capitol ceremony that Almeda was getting a check, 72 years after the war ended.

Shulkin's announcement drew gasps from some of the hundreds in attendance at the Gold Medal ceremony, which House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged was ""long, long overdue.""

Almeda, dressed in his military cap, told the crowd he was glad to be able to accept the medal, noting that ""many have passed away waiting for 75 years for this time to come.""

Almeda said he and other Filipino veterans have long ""felt unrecognized for fighting for our country,"" adding, ""I wondered why"" since he and his fellow soldiers had brought ""victory during a long war in the Philippines.""

The gold medal signified that his service — and that of thousands of other Filipino veterans — is recognized, Almeda said, calling himself a warrior who ""will never quit.""

Almeda was a 24-year-old teacher when he joined the Philippine Commonwealth Army in 1941. After the war, he resumed his career as a teacher and was granted U.S. citizenship in the 1990s. In 2003, he began receiving medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs under a law aimed at Filipino veterans.

But Almeda, now 100 and living outside Washington, has been fighting for nearly a decade to receive a $15,000 lump-sum payment promised to Filipino veterans under the 2009 economic stimulus law.

Almeda was among more than 250,000 Filipino soldiers who served alongside U.S. soldiers in World War II, including more than 57,000 who died. After the war ended, President Harry S. Truman signed laws that stripped away promises of benefits and citizenship for Filipino veterans.

Only recently have the veterans won back some concessions and acknowledgment, including the gold medal.

Ryan said the Capitol ceremony was more than ""a feel-good story of delayed recognition. We are here to immortalize the legacy of great liberators, who have paved the way for generations to follow.""

The ceremony — and the gold medals — should ""serve to ensure that those who fought for freedom are never forgotten, and always remembered,"" Ryan said.

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said Filipino veterans enlisted for World War II ""knowing full well that the enemy could discover who they were and retaliate against their families.""

Even after their service ""was practically erased from American records ... these veterans never gave up,"" Hirono said. ""They organized and fought for what they had earned.""

In 1990, Congress awarded U.S. citizenship to thousands of Filipino veterans and later extended VA benefits to them. The 2009 stimulus law authorized the lump-sum payments, although in some cases missing or poor records blocked the payments from being made.

""After bravely serving our country, it is frankly shameful that these veterans had to fight so hard for what they were promised,"" Hirono said.

Today, only 18,000 Filipino veterans are still alive.

“Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!” the star wrote over an image of her gawking, mouth agape, at Perry’s breasts.

In the wake of the recent Harvey Weinstein scandal, of which DeGeneres was an outspoken critic, dedicating part of her show to sharing her thoughts on the “#MeToo” movement, many fans were quick to mention the idea that this tweet wouldn’t fly had a man posted it. Many began responding to the tweet with the hashtag “#doublestandard.” Others went as far as to compare her to Weinstein and call her a “pig.”

As The Wrap notes, actor Michael Rapaport caught wind of the tweet and voiced his displeasure to Ellen, arguing that “the world would stop” if a man had sent this tweet.

Piers Morgan too speculated that, had a man tweeted something similar, Ellen would be leading the “cries of ‘SEXIST PIG!’”

Previously, the star dedicated her opening monologue to denouncing the growing environment of sexual harassment in Hollywood with an impassioned speech.

The 49-year-old went to the emergency room in October 2016 complaining of stomach pain, nausea and vomiting, according to the case report, which was published online in August in the journal Case Reports in Emergency Medicine.

Though the man's blood and urine tests were normal, an X-ray revealed a curious finding: ""a foreign body resembling a cigarette lighter … within the stomach,"" the doctors who treated the man wrote in the report.

The doctors removed the lighter using a tool called an endoscope — a thin, flexible tube with a camera and forceps that's inserted into the mouth and down into the stomach. The camera revealed that the lighter, which was upside down in the man's stomach, had leaked so much fuel that the man had developed an ulcer, or hole in his stomach lining.

BEARS TIGHT END UNDERGOES EMERGENCY SURGERY AFTER GRUESOME LEG INJURY

This is only the third case in the medical literature of someone swallowing a lighter that then needed to be removed, and it's the first time that it has happened in the U.S., according to the case report. In the two previous instances, doctors needed to remove the lighters because they had caused blockages in the bowel, but the new case was more urgent, because the lighter was leaking fluid.

The chemicals found in lighter fluid are particularly toxic, but in fact it was the man's stomach acid that was responsible for tearing a hole into his gastric tissue. The lighter fluid facilitated this by eating away at the protective mucus layer that separates the stomach lining from stomach acid, according to the report. With no mucus left to act as a buffer, the patient's unchecked stomach acid was free to wreak havoc and cause an ulcer.

""Ulcers from foreign bodies are not that common,"" said Dr. Asim Shuja, a medical internist at the University of Florida College of Medicine who treated the man. But in rare instances, certain objects — especially batteries, which can leak battery acid — can cause problems, Shuja said.

But ulcers like those caused by swallowing the leaky lighter should heal, as long as the object is removed and the ulcers are medicated quickly, Shuja told Live Science. In the man's case, he was given medicine for the ulcer, which had healed by his two-month followup appointment.

Most of the time, when someone swallows something other than food, the object will pass through the person's digestive tract and out the other end with no issues other than discomfort. Frequently swallowed items included dentures, chicken bones or household items, according to a 2012 study published in the journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt International.

But sometimes, people swallow things on purpose, and mental illness or a desire to self-harm plays a role. In this case, the patient was known to have schizophrenia and had previously been hospitalized after he swallowed a spoon.

""Our patient had a history of ingesting objects like spoons [and] razor blades in the past,"" Shuja noted.

In many cases, these patients develop worsening symptoms related to their psychiatric illnesses over time, he said.

TreatmentWhen getting treatment for anemia related to bed bugs, you should first worry about your and your family’s health.
In some cases, they can also cause severe anemia, especially for at-risk groups like seniors or those with a disability.","Nobody in their right mind likes a bed bug. While experts agree they don’t transmit diseases, they can cause a host of other problems.

Not only do they leave mysterious, itchy bites on your skin, but people who have them often find themselves emotionally distressed and sleep-deprived. In addition, within the last few years, doctors have discovered that bed bugs may also cause severe anemia, especially in certain high-risk groups.

In one case reported by the NIH, a 60-year-old man checked in with his doctor after several months of severe fatigue and lethargy. Among other problems, the man had a history of depression, diabetes, drug abuse and alcoholism.

HEART DISEASE: LEARN THE FACTS

He also had bed bugs in his apartment, an infestation so severe that the man’s doctor had even seen bugs crawling on his skin during the day. Although the man didn’t report any signs of outward or gastrointestinal bleeding, lab tests showed that he had an abnormally low iron count.

The doctor started his patient on vitamin supplements, but still the man made several returns over the next few weeks with anemia. At this point, he even needed hospital treatment and units of blood cells.

Having ruled out other factors, his doctor suspected that the bed bugs were the culprit, and authorities were able to get a professional exterminator to control the problem. Months later, the man’s anemia had not returned despite the presence of some bed bugs still in his apartment.

At-Risk Groups

The basic reason that bed bugs cause anemia is that they feed on blood. In the above situation, the man was likely bitten dozens of times every night until his body couldn’t keep up with replenishing the blood supply.

Although this case was a severe infestation, groups such as seniors or the disabled may be at an increased risk even with moderate infestations.

Why would they be more at risk? First, older people have a more difficult time maintaining their iron levels already, making the risk for anemia higher with a bed bug infestation.

5 EARLY SIGNS OF LUNG CANCER YOU SHOULDN'T IGNORE

At the same time, seniors and those with disabilities may be affected more if they’re bedridden or unable to deal with an early infestation.

Then, the risk worsens if these seniors or disabled are living in crowded nursing homes or assisted living places. Bed bugs like inhabiting areas where they can easily find hosts, making nursing homes, apartment buildings, homeless shelters, high-travel locations and large cities all ideal spots.

Finally, people who suffer from depression, drink or use drugs regularly may risk getting anemia from severe infestation. These groups may not give the proper time and attention to cleaning their homes on a regular basis.

Although bed bugs don’t care about cleanliness, a dirty home provides many hiding places for them, making it difficult to find and get rid of the problem early.

Symptoms of Anemia

If you suspect bed bugs in your home or the home of a loved one, you should also watch for anemia. Symptoms include:

Fatigue

Weakness

Dizziness/light-headedness

Pale or yellow skin

Irregular heartbeat

Shortness of breath

Cold extremities

At the beginning, any symptoms may go unnoticed, especially vague symptoms like fatigue. During this time, you may only notice an abnormal shortness of breath or rapid heartbeat during exercise.

After a while, however, these symptoms will get more severe. You should seek prompt medical treatment if you’re experiencing any signs that indicate anemia.

Treatment

When getting treatment for anemia related to bed bugs, you should first worry about your and your family’s health. Everyone in the household should get evaluated by a doctor.

Your doctor will perform a lab test to determine iron counts, and he will likely prescribe supplements and certain foods. In severe cases, he may recommend hospital treatment, including units of blood to help your body along.

Then, as you might have guessed, resolving the anemia for good will mean extermination of the bed bugs in your home. Experts agree that you should hire a professional exterminator to get the job done quickly. Efficiency is important with your health at stake.

BEARTS TIGHT END UNDERGOES EMERGENCY SURGERY AFTER GRUESOME LEG INJURY

Once the exterminator has sprayed your home, you’ll need to wash any clothes and bedding that may be infested in hot water and dry them in a heat dryer. Wipe down the mattress and bed frame before vacuuming in case any eggs are laying around.

Then, vacuum the house thoroughly and throw away the vacuum bag immediately. With thorough cleaning and professional help, you will be able to resolve both problems and prevent them from returning.

While bed bugs aren’t known for carrying diseases, they can provide a great deal of stress and anxiety. In some cases, they can also cause severe anemia, especially for at-risk groups like seniors or those with a disability. Make sure that you inspect your home regularly for these pesky creatures and watch out for those signs of anemia.

McDonald's suppliers will also be required to start gassing the chickens prior to slaughter — a process called ""stunning"" — which will render the slaughtering process painless, the L.A. Times reported. The Times also said that, prior to these guidelines, some suppliers would shock the livestock before cutting their throats.

“We believe these new commitments provide the ability to drive and measure continuous improvement for the health and welfare of chickens,” Bruce Feinberg, a senior director at McDonald’s who oversees chicken, beef, pork, fish and dairy products, wrote in an announcement.

Fortunately for consumers, these changes aren’t expected to raise the cost of McDonald’s chicken menu items, like McNuggets, Buttermilk Chicken Tenders and McChicken sandwiches.

Then, essentially accuse women who didn’t vote for you of being too dumb to think for themselves, by saying they voted the way their husbands and boyfriends told them to vote. Because, surely, a woman could never reject your candidacy on her own. Three cheers for girl power.

Then you have your like-minded feminist girl tribe come out and reinforce your attempt at women-shaming. Michelle Obama said women who didn’t vote for Hillary “voted against their own voice.” Is Mrs. Obama trying to tell us she voted in favor of her own voice in 2008 by secretly voting for Hillary instead of her own husband?

Her remarks were shortly followed by this gem from tennis icon Billie Jean King: “I’m upset with the white women that voted for Mr. Trump. I think they really don’t like themselves.” But the truth is, we like ourselves just fine – we just didn’t happen to like your candidate all that much.

The dictionary describes the women’s movement as “a broad movement campaigning for women’s liberation and rights.” Don’t those rights include the ability to think independently and come to a conclusion that differs from other women?

Technology executive and author Sheryl Sandberg said: “In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.” If that’s truly the endgame, how can we ever hope to stop differentiating between the two if we’re always throwing around the gender card?

If we’re making a practice out of shaming other women instead of empowering them and embracing our differences, then this exclusive type of feminism is really just a front for a particular brand of politics that really has nothing at all to do with women.. It’s time we call it just that.

Take the Mark Halperin and Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandals that recently broke, with the news about Halperin coming out even as the Weinstein revelations still reverberate. Weinstein’s accusers total at least 50 women over a period of 30 years, yet we’re just hearing about it now.

Women who were allegedly victimized by Weinstein were too afraid to speak out. As we’ve also discovered, other Hollywood elites saw it play out and sat on the sidelines in silence, including Jane Fonda, who has been a women’s rights activist for years. She recently said: “I guess it hadn't happened to me, and so I didn't feel that it was my place,” when explaining the reason for her silence and admitting that she knew about Weinstein.

Hillary Clinton’s presidential platform leaned heavily on being a champion of women’s rights, yet it took her five days to issue a statement about Weinstein. What was there to deliberate over for five days when women say they have been sexually abused for the last 30 years by a Hollywood bully?

A bully who happened to donate a lot of money to the Clinton Foundation, it’s worth noting. The foundation recently announced that it won’t return up to $250,000 in donations from Weinstein.

So much hypocrisy.

For decades we’ve been led to believe that feminism is about women. In reality, today’s feminism has very little to do with women. It’s an elitist, exclusive club where the rights of women are championed only if you are certain brand of woman and only if it suits a liberal political agenda.

If you are part of the 42 percent of women in this country who voted for President Trump you are not welcomed, empowered, or supported. Instead, you are shamed, criticized and reprimanded.

Women have made great strides and come too far in the last 100 years to be bullied into falling blindly in line with other women out of some fabricated sense of duty based purely on the fact that we share the same body parts. In that sense, Hillary’s loss was a victory for women – proof we won’t be controlled or manipulated by anyone.

Archaeologists explored around 70 cave systems on Puerto Rico’s Mona island. The thousands of designs, created centuries ago, comprise the largest concentration of indigenous pre-Columbian rock art in the Caribbean, according to experts.

A paper, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, describes the incredible art in the labyrinthine cave network, spanning human, animal and “meandering” designs. While some of the designs are painted or drawn, others have been scratched with fingers into the soft walls of the cave, a similar technique to that used in the Palaeolithic rock art of Southern Europe.

16TH-CENTURY CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS FOUND IN CARIBBEAN CAVE

“Most of the work we have identified in this scientific study is done during an intense period of indigenous activity in the caves between AD1200 and European arrival after AD1492,” explained Dr. Jago Cooper, curator of the Americas at the British Museum, who worked on the paper.

In an email to Fox News, Cooper explained that the indigenous population in the Caribbean likely numbered in the millions when Europeans arrived. “On Mona they might be described as Taino, a name given to the indigenous population living in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola at this time,” he added.

In addition to the British Museum, the University of Leicester in the U.K., the British Geological Survey and Cambridge University all worked on the cave project. Students from the U.K. and Puerto Rico carrying out dissertations in climate science, archaeology and history also participated.

EXPERTS DISCOVER 'CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS' ANCHOR AT CARIBBEAN SHIPWRECK SITE

The rock art offers a fascinating glimpse into Mona’s forgotten Taino population. As a result of European raids, most of the indigenous population on Mona is thought to have died or fled the island by the end of the 16th century.

“Scientific analyses from the team have provided the first dates for rock art in the Caribbean - illustrating that these images are pre-Columbian made by artists exploring and experimenting deep underground,” said Dr. Alice Samson, lecturer in archaeology at the University of Leicester, who co-authored of the paper, in a statement.

500-YEAR-OLD NATIVE AMERICAN CANOE TO BE UNVEILED TO THE PUBLIC AT MISSISSIPPI MUSEUM

Cooper told Fox News that the Taino people snorted a drug called Cohoba, which is the ground seeds of the cojobana tree, as part of their religious rites. While the drug was not necessarily used by the cave artists, it was likely used by their leaders, according to Cooper.

“Cohoba was a powerful hallucinogenic drug taken by Taino caciques (chiefs) or spiritual leaders to help facilitate engagement with the spiritual world,” he said. “We also know that caves are spiritual domains as the Taino have an origin myth that their people emerged from a cave called Cacibajagua.”

The paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science is the result of research undertaken between 2013 and 2016. The Mona fieldwork was funded by National Geographic.

Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

The station also reported that a judge ruled Monday that lawyers in civil lawsuits will be allowed to inspect the grounds of the Route 91 Harvest music festival, where the attack occurred.

As of Monday, Sheppard and five other plaintiffs – two in Nevada and three in California – have filed lawsuits related to the attack, according to the New Yorker.

Sheppard’s lawsuit is against MGM Resorts International, the owners of Mandalay Bay, Live Nation, a bump stock maker and gunman Stephen Paddock’s estate.

“I flew like three feet,” she told the New Yorker, describing how she was hit in the chest and abdomen by the bullets raining down on the festival. “I mean, I just flew like a fish, just straight back.”

Paddock fired out of his window from his room on the 32nd floor of the resort on Oct. 1, killing 58 at the concert. Concertgoers described panicked scenes as they raced for the exits of the property, located across the street from the hotel.

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

The lawsuit, filed in 2014, accused GM of deceptive business practices and unfair competition. It alleged the automaker marketed its brand as safe and reliable while failing to disclose defects including power steering, air bag and brake problems. As a result of the failures, at least 124 people died and 275 were injured, according to the Orange County Register .

Earlier this month, GM agreed to pay $120 million to resolve claims from 49 states and the District of Columbia over faulty ignition switches. The California Attorney General's Office received $7 million in the settlement.

In a Friday statement obtained by the Register, the company said: ""GM has reached a constructive settlement with Orange County, Calif. to resolve claims filed by the Orange County district attorney regarding the company's advertising of vehicles that were subject to certain recalls in 2014, including the ignition-switch recall.""

Prosecutors said GM trained its staff to never use the words ""defect"" or ""stall"" and routinely chose the ""cheapest part supplier without regard for safety."" The lawsuit said the company also discouraged employees from addressing safety issues, according to the newspaper.

Over five months in 2014, GM was forced to recall 17 million vehicles in 33 recalls for various defects, officials said.

""Since 2014, GM has taken important steps to help ensure the safety of its vehicles, including a new organizational structure dedicated to global vehicle safety and a robust Speak Up for Safety program,"" the company's statement added.

The settlement in Orange County was approved by a judge on Friday.

Tiny homes are the newest environmentally friendly living trend, with tiny-living communities popping up all over the U.S. In fact, there are more than 30 tiny-home developments across the country, but in North Carolina, homeowners are concerned that community of such homes may decrease property values and cause an increase in traffic.

“Tiny homes are nice, but not in this area…” - Joe Black

In a first for the city, however, tiny-house developer Kelvin Young has announced plans to design a community of 56 small residences.

$28K 'FIXER UPPER' HOME PUT ON MARKET FOR ALMOST $1 MILLION

“My goal is to bring together people who want to make a choice in having the economic freedom of living smaller, living tiny. It’s a choice,” Young says.

The announcement came shortly after Young built a blue one-bedroom, one-bathroom 493-square-foot tiny home with a bright red door right across the street from Black’s house.

“It will create a major traffic problem in this area, especially in the morning between 7 to 7:30 and in the afternoon between 2:30 and 3:30. The buses can’t get by now,"" Black says.

Black has lived in northwest Charlotte for over 48 years. He says he likes tiny homes, and he may live in one someday, but he feels they should be built in another neighborhood.

“This is not the area for it. This area has been here for a long time and its [for] larger homes. And I don’t think the people out here want it to come here,” Black says.

In some cities nationwide, tiny homes also violate building codes, as they're too small to legally inhabit. Charlotte, too, has minimum size requirements for homes, but Young's developments will presumably meet the minimums.

Furthermore, Young feels the area would benefit from the development.

“The 28214 zip code has some of the worst schools in Charlotte, so it’s not like people are just rushing to get to this community, and this will be a great way to spark some interest in a community that needs some positive people moving in,” Young says.

TINY HOME COMMUNITY IN THE WORKS FOR HOMELESS VETS

“Like I said, it’s progress and we can’t defeat progress."" - Glenn Gurley

Another resident of the neighborhood, Carolyn Palmer, has lived in the area for more than 30 years. Her home is located directly across the street from where the new community is set to be built, and like Black, she feels the tiny-home community would be best placed elsewhere. She and a few other neighbors also tell Fox News that they're not against the idea in and of itself — they simply feel the community will suffer from increased traffic, and they believe the smaller homes could impact the values of their own.

“They have this one already here. It’ll be here,"" Black says of the house Young built across from his own. ""Just cancel the other development and go somewhere else, where it’s wanted and more convenient for the situation.""

But not every neighbor feels the new development will cause problems.

“Like I said, it’s progress and we can’t defeat progress,” 90-year-old Glenn Gurley tells Fox News. “I don’t think [tiny home community] will affect [property value] too much. Property value goes up according to how well the place is kept up,"" Gurley says.

Gurley has lived two doors down from Palmer for over 30 years, and he says he’s looking forward to having more new neighbors. “Well, it’s new friendship when people move into the community. We’ll go to them and welcome them into the community and they are one of us,” Gurley says.

Broker Christopher Carter further tells Fox News he believes the development will have little impact on the overall property values of the neighborhood as long as the neighborhood is restricted to owner occupants only.

“Generally speaking, realtors use price/sq. ft. as the measure of property values in a neighborhood, and the tiny homes for sale in the Coulwood neighborhood are actually at a higher price/sq. ft. than other homes in the area,” Carter says. “That being said, I do not see the tiny home neighborhood driving up property values, because I think the real estate consumer is going to differentiate a tiny house and its value just as they do with pricing of a mobile home.”

Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

In order to pacify almost 300 passengers during their two unscheduled diversions, American Airlines fed everybody a slice of pizza.

After flight crew aboard an American Airlines flight from Milan to Miami on Saturday noticed a crack in the windshield, they made an emergency diversion to Stephenville Airport in Newfoundland, Canada.

While the aircraft was taken out of service for repairs, the airline had a two-part plan. One: fly an alternate plane up to Newfoundland to collect the 287 passengers. And two: feed them pizza.

After eating pizza at Stephenville Airport, passengers boarded an alternate plane 10 hours later. However, instead of flying down to Miami, the plane went to New York’s JFK airport. A spokesperson for the airline told Travel + Leisure that due to crew time and customs availability, they were unable to fly the passengers directly from Canada to Miami.

However, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner wasn’t impressed by McCarthy’s look.

McCarthy continued, “So I went home that night trying to find sexy, and I came back and go, ‘OK, listen, all you’re going to get is a smile. That’s all I know how to do’.”

McCarthy’s megawatt smile landed her the deal of a lifetime – she was selected out of thousands of applicants for Playboy’s October 1993 issue. She went on to receive the coveted title of “Playmate of the Year.”

Hefner died in late September at age 91.

McElwain’s downfall was more about relationships than records (3-4, 3-3 Southeastern Conference).

His already strained rapport with administrators reached a new low last Monday when he said Florida players and families had received death threats. The bombshell shocked Athletic Director Scott Stricklin, who had not been previously notified about a potentially harmful situation.

Stricklin met with McElwain later that day, and the coach rebuffed a request to provide more information about the threats. The athletic department responded with a statement that essentially criticized McElwain for being uncooperative.

McElwain said two days later that he would provide more details about the death threats “when it becomes unmanageable,” but gave no other details.

Stricklin named defensive coordinator Randy Shannon the team’s interim coach for the final four games.

“We want to thank Coach McElwain for his efforts in leading the Gator football program,” Stricklin said in a statement. “We are confident Coach Shannon will provide the proper guidance to the players and rest of staff during this time, and we will begin a national search for the next head coach.”

The parties are negotiating McElwain’s $12.5 million buyout.

Florida, which is still paying former coach Will Muschamp, would like to significantly reduce McElwain’s sum and could use his actions over the last week as leverage.

Regardless of the outcome, McElwain’s tenure will be remembered for failing to fix a floundering offense.

Three years ago, McElwain proclaimed he could win with his dog at quarterback.

The Gators currently rank 113th in total offense, in triple digits nationally for the third time in McElwain’s three seasons.

McElwain went 22-12 with the Gators, including 4-9 against ranked teams, and became the first coach in league history to take a team to the SEC championship game in his first two years.

Florida was eliminated from contention in the Eastern Division with a 42-7 loss to rival Georgia on Saturday. It was Florida’s most lopsided loss in the series since 1982.

“I know what I was brought here to do. Look, we haven’t been good on offense, I get it,” McElwain said on Saturday night. “We’ve won a few games, but we haven’t won enough. We haven’t won a championship. That’s real. That’s life. That is this business, and I take full responsibility for all of it.”

McElwain’s problems started long before last week.

The former Alabama assistant and Colorado State head coach complained publicly about Florida’s facilities shortly after taking the job and openly questioned the school’s commitment to the football program two years later. His initial comments came while the Gators were planning to build an indoor practice facility and his most recent ones came after they had announced plans to build a $60 million, stand-alone football facility.

Fox Sports analyst Joel Klatt‏ called him out for his history of unsportsmanlike conduct, tweeting: “McElwain treated his staff at Colorado State terrible once he got the Florida job that they helped him get...Sorry I don’t feel sorry.”

“It’s not really a laughing matter,” the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” ​host ​says about the rape and sexual assault allegations pouring out against Weinstein​ in New York magazine out Monday​.

“There’ll be a lot of people in that room who maybe have been through experiences with him, and that’s not something I want them to relive on the night they get their Oscar.”

Kimmel hosted this year’s Oscars and is the first comedian since the 1990s who was asked to lead the awards show for the second year in a row.

“The Oscars are so far out,” he ​tells​ New York.

“It’s hard to figure out what we’re going to say on the next show, let alone in March. There might not be an Oscars, because North Korea may have struck the Dolby Theatre.”

The Brooklyn-born comic said he didn’t ​immediately ​address the Weinstein sexual abuse scandal on his show merely because of timing – and not, as some critics have suggested, because he was trying to protect anybody.

“We do the show Monday through Thursday. I didn’t see the Weinstein story break till shortly before the show started on a Thursday night, and then we had a rerun on Friday, so that’s why it wasn’t mentioned in our monologue,” said the comic.

“I have no interest in protecting Harvey Weinstein. Hopefully, he will get what he deserves and we’ll all move on with our lives.”

Although he made no cracks about Weinstein in the interview,​ ​Kimmel did chuckle about how he’s become an avatar ​for the average white guy.

“There is nothing more disgraceful than being a middle-aged white man. We should all be ashamed of ourselves,” ​deadpanned Kimmel, 49.

“I was born with a penis to white parents. There’s not much I can do about it. If you’re against discrimination, you should be against all discrimination.”

Kimmel said he uses his show to talk about politics, and hot topics like gun control and health care, because he has been personally affected by the issues.

On April 21, his wife, Molly McNerney, gave birth to Billy, who was diagnosed with a rare heart condition. Emergency surgery, which was covered by his health plan, saved his son’s life.

“It so happened that my son had a heart operation and then my hometown got attacked,” he said, referring to the Las Vegas shooting.

“So that’s what prompted me to speak out in a way that a lot of people noticed, but the truth of the matter is, we have been talking about politics for a very long time.”

Sexual harassment occurs when one person chooses to sexually objectify another person. And in a tweet, DeGeneres shared a photo of herself and singer Katy Perry with DeGeneres’ jaw wide open and gawking directly at Perry's breasts. To complete the hypocritical gesture, DeGeneres included this caption:

“Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!”

The real question now is how would DeGeneres have responded if it were a man who did exactly what she did – taking a photo posing with his jaw wide open and head gawking into the breasts of another woman?

How would DeGeneres react if it were a man making the same comments, calling a woman’s breasts “big balloons?” She would no doubt be one of the first people to publicly condemn such an action as being sexist and harassment.

“This is not a male thing or a female thing, it is not a Hollywood thing or a political thing, this is a human thing and it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world and we are all the same,” she said on her TV show in a monologue discussing sexual harassment. “We all want the same thing, we want respect, love and kindness. And if I could have those three things and an iPhone X, I would be complete.”

So how does DeGeneres justify her sexist action?

Is it because she's a woman and she thinks that it's okay for one woman to objectify another woman's body?

Is it because DeGeneres believes that since she is a lesbian she can objectify or make sexual comments about another woman's body?

If you are going to be a social justice warrior Ellen, then you must also be the example. You cannot just bandy words around and argue against sexual harassment, calling for love, respect and kindness for all humans when you are actually the one engaging in the very thing you condemn.

It is exactly these sorts of behaviors that lead the general public to become so exhausted and disgusted by the hypocrisy of Hollywood.

Ellen, don't use an anti-sexual harassment campaign to build yourself up or to widen your audience or to gain more ratings. Do it because you believe in it. And if you believe in it then maintain your integrity and be consistent in your actions. At the very least, you could own up to your sexist actions, apologize and learn from your own mistakes.",Ellen DeGeneres proves she’s a hypocrite with sexist tweet of herself staring at Katy Perry’s breasts,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/ellen-degeneres-proves-s-hypocrite-with-sexist-tweet-herself-staring-at-katy-perry-s-breasts.html

The letters at the end stand for “Retractable Fastback.”

That doesn’t exactly describe it, either.

The car is not a fastback. It may look like one in profile, but it has flying buttresses, a recessed rear window and a targa top, just like Magnum P.I.’s Ferrari. The roof is power-retractable, however, through a mesmerizing 10-second dance.

Flick a toggle switch and the rear section — comprised of the buttresses connected by a basket handle — rises up to expose the bin where the Miata soft top’s roof normally goes. The roof panel and rear window flip and fold away into it, and the rest falls back into place. What you’re left with is a very different-looking Miata, which was the point.

The last-generation Miata was also available with a retractable hardtop, but it was shaped like a solid version of the standard fabric roof. It looked bulky and awkward when it was closed. The model was a big seller, however, so Mazda North America design manager Ken Saward says he and his team really wanted to do it justice this time around. They did. The RF has the flair of a classic sports car, roof up or down.

While taking photos of it in a parking lot, I was approached by an ancient man wearing a U.S. Navy ship baseball cap and driving an SUV with U.S. Marine stickers all over it. He asked if I was married. Not sure where he was going with the line of inquiry, I was honest and answered yes, to which he responded, “Too bad, you’ll be chasing the single girls away in that thing. It’s hot!”

He wasn’t wrong about the attention the car gets. Compared to the regular Miata, it turns a lot more heads. It’s amazing what a little plumage can do.

But its primary purpose is to give the car a more coupe-like feel, and at this it’s less successful.

To keep its weight down, the Miata does without much sound insulation throughout. The RF may prove to be a little warmer in cold weather, but it doesn’t seem significantly quieter than other Miatas I’ve driven, especially on the highway.

That’s also true when the roof is down. While the open rear window means you’re not scooping in too much air, the corner of the basket handle catches enough of the breeze right next to your ear to stir up a racket. Rolling up the window helps, but then what’s the point?

Dynamically speaking, though, the RF is essentially the same as any Miata. Which means it’s very good. The transformation only adds 113 pounds, and it’s been well-accommodated through adjustments made to the suspension and steering to maintain the Miata’s legendary handling. There’s no change to its 155 hp four-cylinder engine, so, head to head, the RF would lose at an autocross. But without a stopwatch handy, you’d never know the difference.

You will notice the difference in price: about two-and-a-half grand above the soft top, depending on the trim level. The RF starts at $32,430 for a performance-focused Club and $33,795 for a Grand Touring with leather upholstery, lane-departure warning and a few other luxury niceties. Sorry, bargain shoppers, the RF is not available in the Miata’s entry-level Sport trim.

High fashion does not come cheap.

Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and the Houston Astros kept hammering away in a wild slugfest that no one saw coming, rallying against Clayton Kershaw and rocking the Los Angeles Dodgers 13-12 in 10 thrilling innings Sunday night for a 3-2 lead in the World Series.

In a tension-filled game of monster momentum swings at pulsating Minute Maid Park, the last one belonged to Alex Bregman. With the packed crowd still standing well past midnight, Bregman hit an RBI single with two outs off Kenley Jansen to win it after 5 hours, 17 minutes.

Wacky and whacky with seven home runs, this perhaps topped Toronto's 15-14 win over the Phillies in 1993 as the craziest World Series game ever.

Altuve, Correa, Yuli Gurriel, George Springer and Brian McCann homered for Houston. Cody Bellinger and Yasiel Puig went deep for the Dodgers, who scored three times in the ninth to make it 12-all.

Silent when ace Dallas Keuchel got crushed, the orange-clad fans erupted over and over as the Astros sent balls careening all around -- and out of -- the park.

Yet on another night of Home Run Derby in the Year of the Home Run, no lead was safe.

Puig lined a two-run shot in the ninth, the record 22nd homer in a single Series, and Chris Taylor's two-out single off Chris Devenski tied it.

Now, with both bullpens worn down, the teams get a day to recover. It'll be Game 6 on Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, where Justin Verlander will try to clinch the Astros' first championship and Rich Hill hopes to save Los Angeles' season.

Out of nowhere, the Astros climbed out of a four-run hole against Kershaw and then erased two more deficits later in the game, tying it each time on a homer.

Correa leaped and twirled after launching a two-run drive made it 11-8 in the seventh. McCann's shot in the eighth added a much-needed insurance run.

Bellinger homered for Los Angeles, a three-run drive in the fifth that made it 7-4 and seemed to swing things back in the Dodgers' favor. By the end of the mayhem on the mound, it was a mere afterthought.

The Astros (13) and Dodgers (9) topped the Series mark for homers, set when Barry Bonds and the Giants lost to the Angels in seven games in 2002.

But really, who imagined this?

No wonder there's a bright sign high above the center field wall for a popular taco place in town -- it says Torchy and fit perfectly for a game where pitchers got lit up.

A day earlier, Kershaw stood alone on the mound after the Dodgers' dramatic win in Game 4, trying to get a visual for the biggest start of his career.

This was definitely not how he pictured it.

The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner cruised into the fourth with a 4-0 lead before things suddenly fell apart. After Correa hit an RBI double, Gurriel hit a tying, three-run drive.

Kershaw whipped his head around to watch Gurriel's drive sail, his face immediately showing shock, utter disbelief and frustration, all wrapped up in one expression before he bent over, hands on his knees.

Yanked in the fifth, Kershaw trudged off with a dubious distinction -- he has allowed a postseason-record eight home runs this year.

Hardly a repeat performance from the opener, when Kershaw dominated while outpitching Keuchel for a 3-1 win.

Gurriel's second homer of the Series also kept open this possibility: Imagine the scene if Major League Baseball presents Gurriel with the MVP trophy, so soon after Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended him for the first five games next year for making a racist gesture toward Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish.

Keuchel never got into a rhythm during the shortest home start of his All-Star career. His breaking pitches spun without much movement, and he was pulled in the fourth.

Logan Forsythe did the early damage against his former University of Arkansas teammate. A Series surprise, Forsythe lined a two-out, two-run single in the first, and doubled and scored in the fourth for a 4-0 lead.

The Dodgers hadn't lost a game this year when they led by four runs. But Kershaw's bedeviling postseason past came back to haunt him at the worst time.

Kershaw was pulled after a pair of two-out walks in the bottom of the fifth. And with crowd sensing something big, the 5-foot-6 Altuve connected off Kenta Maeda for a home run that made it 7-all.","Astros take wild Game 5, take 3-2 lead to Los Angeles",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/30/astros-take-wild-game-5-take-3-2-lead-to-los-angeles.html

But ironically, nearly 100 years later we’re still not fully free to exercise that right as we see fit, according to today’s feminists.

Now, instead of having men or the government controlling our behavior, other women are attempting to control our thoughts and tell us what we must do. According to modern day feminists, we are obligated to fall in lock step with them simply because we share the same body parts.

Isn’t the entire point of feminism for women to empower each other to be whoever we want to be, and do anything we want to do?

It turns out we didn’t read the fine print that says: except if you’re conservative, then you need to shut up because someone is obviously doing the thinking for you. Someone old and white and male. Because no legitimate, card-carrying female with our body parts would ever dare have a thought different from ours.

It’s been almost a year since the presidential election, but the liberal feminists still can’t wrap their heads around the fact that a majority of white women voted for a man instead of a woman for president.

One would think it’s time that we all channel our inner snow queen and “let it go.” But that’s not happening.

If you’re Hillary Clinton, it’s more fun instead to kick off a blame-game book tour and talk about all the reasons you lost (none of them your fault, of course).

Then, essentially accuse women who didn’t vote for you of being too dumb to think for themselves, by saying they voted the way their husbands and boyfriends told them to vote. Because, surely, a woman could never reject your candidacy on her own. Three cheers for girl power.

Then you have your like-minded feminist girl tribe come out and reinforce your attempt at women-shaming. Michelle Obama said women who didn’t vote for Hillary “voted against their own voice.” Is Mrs. Obama trying to tell us she voted in favor of her own voice in 2008 by secretly voting for Hillary instead of her own husband?

Her remarks were shortly followed by this gem from tennis icon Billie Jean King: “I’m upset with the white women that voted for Mr. Trump. I think they really don’t like themselves.” But the truth is, we like ourselves just fine – we just didn’t happen to like your candidate all that much.

The dictionary describes the women’s movement as “a broad movement campaigning for women’s liberation and rights.” Don’t those rights include the ability to think independently and come to a conclusion that differs from other women?

Technology executive and author Sheryl Sandberg said: “In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.” If that’s truly the endgame, how can we ever hope to stop differentiating between the two if we’re always throwing around the gender card?

If we’re making a practice out of shaming other women instead of empowering them and embracing our differences, then this exclusive type of feminism is really just a front for a particular brand of politics that really has nothing at all to do with women.. It’s time we call it just that.

Take the Mark Halperin and Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandals that recently broke, with the news about Halperin coming out even as the Weinstein revelations still reverberate. Weinstein’s accusers total at least 50 women over a period of 30 years, yet we’re just hearing about it now.

Women who were allegedly victimized by Weinstein were too afraid to speak out. As we’ve also discovered, other Hollywood elites saw it play out and sat on the sidelines in silence, including Jane Fonda, who has been a women’s rights activist for years. She recently said: “I guess it hadn't happened to me, and so I didn't feel that it was my place,” when explaining the reason for her silence and admitting that she knew about Weinstein.

Hillary Clinton’s presidential platform leaned heavily on being a champion of women’s rights, yet it took her five days to issue a statement about Weinstein. What was there to deliberate over for five days when women say they have been sexually abused for the last 30 years by a Hollywood bully?

A bully who happened to donate a lot of money to the Clinton Foundation, it’s worth noting. The foundation recently announced that it won’t return up to $250,000 in donations from Weinstein.

So much hypocrisy.

For decades we’ve been led to believe that feminism is about women. In reality, today’s feminism has very little to do with women. It’s an elitist, exclusive club where the rights of women are championed only if you are certain brand of woman and only if it suits a liberal political agenda.

If you are part of the 42 percent of women in this country who voted for President Trump you are not welcomed, empowered, or supported. Instead, you are shamed, criticized and reprimanded.

Women have made great strides and come too far in the last 100 years to be bullied into falling blindly in line with other women out of some fabricated sense of duty based purely on the fact that we share the same body parts. In that sense, Hillary’s loss was a victory for women – proof we won’t be controlled or manipulated by anyone.

Those were the words of then-candidate Donald Trump during the first presidential debate of the 2016 race. It wasn’t the first time he’d used that line or some variation of it.

But it particularly stuck out to me that evening and it was the first thing that jumped to mind Monday morning when I woke up (I’m not an early riser, now you know) to the news that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his former business partner Rick Gates had been indicted on 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal and making false statements, amongst others. Former Trump advisor George Papadopolous has now pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI in the Mueller probe directly related to Russian interference.

It’s not a good day for Team Trump.

I know options are limited when you’re running a campaign based on fear, nativism and general bullsh*t, but Manafort serves a very specific purpose: he is part of the underworld of politics where dealing with other Trump campaign standouts like Carter Page and Roger Stone (who I imagine will be getting knocks on their doors from FBI agents very soon) is normal.

But you don’t need me to talk you through the Russian collusion story and where we go from here. Mueller is clearly doing his job and I’d love to see someone prove that this grand jury was full of Democrat donors who are currently laughing on a yacht with Bill Clinton throwing back champagne and FaceTiming Obama.

So if you love Trump, take a day off from tweeting about Uranium One and process the gravity of what’s going on here. It’s a big deal.

What I do think you need to hear from me is how important it is to admit that our political heroes are fallible and may not be what we want them to be.

I’m well aware of the fact that no one who is reading this and has heard me on air is confused about my views on Donald Trump. He was never qualified to run for president and shows us this every day.

Nevertheless, I respect the fact that he’s a hero to millions of Americans. He certainly turned the system on its head, and since it’s agreed on both sides of the aisle that Washington is broken, I can see why a disruptor candidate could appeal. This particular one holds views abhorrent to me, but so it goes. It’s not like I’d have been voting for Marco Rubio either.

The point is that it’s okay to admit that your political heroes aren’t always what you thought they were. I’ve always known Hillary Clinton was flawed and have been quite happy to talk about it on TV, even on Fox News where if I criticize her, there isn’t going to be anyone around to defend her in my place.

I still remember the day I said out loud and on national television that it looked like Hillary had lied about Benghazi. While she refused to join the Sunday show circuit and it was clear blaming the YouTube video wasn’t her idea, the email to Chelsea telling her that it seemed the attack had been committed by an al Qaeda-like group indicated to me that she knew, at the very least, that the video wasn’t sole reason for the raid. Fog of war is a real thing, but it smelled bad to me so I said so.

My Twitter timeline lit up with a mix of compliments for being honest and the usual haters wondering when I was going to join “the dark side.” (By the way, the GOP really is the dark side and I’m never coming.)

But nothing had changed for me because I always knew that Hillary was human, just like the rest of us. She makes mistakes and she even apologizes for most of them. If you haven’t read her book, “What Happened,” it’s worth it just to see some of those apologies.

To err is human. And it looks like Trump is majorly human this morning as he entrusted his campaign to a foreign agent with clear ties to Russians who wanted Trump sitting right where he is right now. I also have no doubt we’ll learn of many more serious errors as the Mueller investigation rolls on.

So if you love Trump, take a day off from tweeting about Uranium One and process the gravity of what’s going on here. It’s a big deal.

I know why I’m still able to support Hillary after Benghazi and any other “scandal” right wingers drum up. It’s critical to always check one’s support and she passes the bar each time. I’m also happy to debate anyone on the merits of her platform and her career of service. Just name the time and place.

Trump supporters will have to go through that process as we see increasing evidence that Russia gave a little more than a wink and a nod to the Trump campaign.

Admitting the humanness of our heroes is freeing, I promise.","Hey, Trump fans: Manafort indictment means your hero isn't perfect (and that's OK)",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/30/hey-trump-fans-manafort-indictment-means-your-hero-isnt-perfect-and-thats-ok.html

Two of the seven North Korean agents who were involved in the alleged plot were arrested in Beijing, South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo reported Monday, citing North Korean sources. The plot was stopped because Chinese officials increased security during the country’s 19 National Congress of the Communist Party.

""Special operatives belonging to the North's reconnaissance squad have penetrated to remove Kim Han Sol, but some of them were arrested last week by the Chinese Ministry of National Security and are currently under investigation at special facilities outside Beijing,” the source told JongAng Ilbo.

KIM JONG UN'S SIBLINGS: ERIC CLAPTON MEGA-FAN, POLITICIAN, SHADOWY SISTER

Kim Han Sol, who is reportedly in his 20s, surfaced in March after he released a video confirming the death of his father, Kim Jong Nam, who was killed in February when two women smeared the banned VX nerve agent on his face at Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur airport. Speaking in English, Kim Jong Un’s nephew showed his passport as proof of his identity and said, “my father has been killed a few days ago.”

He continued, “I’m currently with my mother and sister. We hope…” before the video’s audio abruptly cuts off. He ends with, “we hope this gets better soon.”

Two women are on trial in Kim Jong Nam’s death. They have denied being part of the assassination plot and said they were duped into thinking they were playing a harmless prank for a reality television show. The involvement of missing North Korean agents have fueled a South Korea spy agency’s claim that the attack was part of a careful plot set up by Kim Jong Un to kill his brother.

The half-brother and his family were living in exile since the early 2000s when Kim Jong Nam fell out of favor with his father, Kim Jong Il. Kim Han Sol, like many Kim family members, attended school outside of North Korea, including United World College in Mostar, Bosnia. He then moved to France to attend Paris Institute of Political Studies, the BBC reported. He is fluent in English.

Kim previously spoke out about his “dictator” uncle during a 2012 interview on a Finnish TV show.

""I've always dreamed that one day I would go back and make things better, and make things easier for the people back there. I also dream of unification,” Kim said about North Korea.

He added that he spent summers in North Korea when his family was living in exile to “meet with my relatives and keep in touch with my family.”

""I don't really know how he became a dictator because first of all it was between him and my grandfather,” he said.

The North Korean despot had his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, executed in 2013 and accused him of being a ""traitor"" and committing a series of ""hideous crimes.""

Court papers filed Friday say about $1.65 million would go upfront to the widow and daughter of Jason Simcakoski, of Stevens Point, Wis., who was 35 when he died in 2014 at the Tomah VA facility. Another $659,000 would go into annuities for Simcakoski's widow, Heather, and their daughter, Anaya. The rest would go to attorney fees and expenses.



The Wisconsin State Journal reported Saturday that a federal judge will hold a hearing Wednesday on whether to approve the settlement.



Simcakoski's death led to the firing of the Tomah VA's chief of staff, Dr. David Houlihan, who agreed this past January to surrender his medical license permanently. The former head of the center, Mario DeSanctis, was fired in 2015 but fought his dismissal and eventually was allowed to resign, USA Today reported earlier this month. He and his lawyer were paid $163,000, it said.

Simcakoski, who was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2002, had been treated from 2006 to 2014 for a variety of conditions. He was admitted to the Tomah VA's acute psychiatric unit on Aug. 10, 2014, then transferred to a short stay unit.



On the morning of Aug. 30, 2014, he was so sedated he could barely speak, his family alleged in the lawsuit. He was found unresponsive that afternoon. He died after life-saving attempts were made, although they weren't started for about 10 minutes after he was found.



An autopsy determined that Simcakoski died from mixed drug toxicity. The inspector general found that doctors who prescribed his medications failed to talk with him about the risks, and noted delays in the start of CPR and the lack of medication at the Tomah VA to reverse drug overdoses.

Appearing on CBS’ “Face the Nation” to publicize his memoir entitled, “An American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice,” Khan said Kelly “indulged in defending behavior of the president and made the situation even worse.”

He criticized Kelly for standing by President Donald Trump, who engaged in a very public feud on TV and Twitter last week over Gold Star families.

Khan, the father of U.S. soldier Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq, added that “restraint and dignity” should be “the call of the moment” when dealing with Gold Star families, instead of turning them into a “political football.”

His comments came more than a year after the Democrats gave him a major platform: the party's 2016 convention. Khan said on stage that Trump had “sacrificed nothing and no one” for America — unlike Humayun, who posthumously received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart after a suicide bomber killed him in 2004.

Trump later challenged Khizr Khan’s claims. “I’ve made a lot of sacrifices,” Trump said. “I work very, very hard. I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures.”

Trump has been engaged in an ongoing feud with Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., who said she listened in to a condolence call he made last week to an Army widow. Wilson said Trump told the widow that her deceased husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, “knew what he signed up for.” Trump denied it.

Kelly on Thursday publicly criticized Wilson’s involvement in the call and also suggested she was trying to politicize the matter.

Wilson also suggested that Kelly, whose son was killed in Afghanistan, was forced to make public statements on the call to save his job, amid speculation that Trump is unhappy with his performance.

Khan, a Charlottesville resident, also expressed shock on “Face the Nation” about seeing Kelly “standing next to the President when the President could not have the proper words to condemn the attack on the blessed city of Charlottesville, Virginia by Neo-Nazis.”

Trump was criticized for saying “both sides” were to blame after white nationalists and alt-right groups gathered in the southern town to protest the removal of a Confederate statue on August 12, sparking violence. Police said a Nazi sympathizer plowed his car through a group of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer, a paralegal.

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

The two defendants will be able to argue before a judge that Mueller’s appointment by Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein violated the special counsel law.
And a new special counsel should be appointed – this time to investigate Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump.","Over the weekend, the mainstream media was absolutely giddy with delight upon learning there would be an indictment by special counsel, Robert Mueller.

This was proof positive, they insisted, that Trump “colluded” with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Their exuberance was the equivalent of a two day-long tailgate party. Too bad it was premature.

Manafort & Gates

The celebration came to a crashing end when the indictments of Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, were unsealed Monday morning. It turns out the charges are, basically, a tax fraud case. The two men stand accused of hiding their income from their lobbying work for Ukraine in order to avoid paying taxes, then lying about it. That’s it.

The 31-page indictment makes no mention of Trump or Russia or “collusion.” The media seemed as dejected as a kid who wakes up on Christmas morning, only to find there are no presents under the tree. Gee whiz.

The truth is, it should have come as no surprise to anyone, much less the media, that Manafort was in legal jeopardy for his business dealings. The FBI raided his home over the summer. It was later learned that the FBI wiretapped his conversations as far back as 2014. And it was widely reported that Manafort had been told by Mueller’s team that he would be criminally charged.

It could be said that Hillary Clinton is the one who was conspiring with the Russians by breaking campaign finance laws with impunity.

The media became even more dispirited when they read through the indictment, discovering that nearly all of Manafort’s alleged wrongdoing substantially pre-dates his brief stint as chairman of the Trump campaign. In other words, there is no connection to either Trump or his campaign.

Somewhere, I’m sure, ABC’s Martha Raddatz and CNN’s Van Jones were crying. Again. Just like the tears they shed on camera election night when Hillary lost.

Papadopoulos

But wait. Shortly after the indictments were unsealed, the media’s spirits were suddenly boosted when the special counsel revealed that a former adviser to Trump pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian national during his time on the Trump campaign. Surely this was evidence of illegal “collusion,” right?

Wrong. George Papadopoulos pled guilty to a single charge of making a false statement to the FBI. He was not charged with so-called “collusion” because no such crime exists in American statutory law, except in anti-trust matters. It has no application to elections and political campaigns.

It is not a crime to talk to a Russian. Or, in Papadopoulos’s case, attempting to talk with a Russian through an intermediary. Not that the media would ever understand that. They have never managed to point to a single statute that makes “colluding” with a foreign government in a political campaign a crime, likely because it does not exist in the criminal codes.

To put it plainly, Mueller is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law. It is a legal impossibility. He is being asked to do something that is manifestly unattainable.

But that did not stop them from accusing Donald Trump, Jr., of illegally conspiring with the Russians when he met with a Russian lawyer to obtain information on Hillary Clinton. What law did he break? None. The Federal Election Commission has made it clear that it is perfectly lawful for foreign nationals to be involved in campaigns, as long as they are not paid and do not donate money. Which brings us to Hillary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton

It is against the law for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to funnel millions of dollars to a British spy and to Russian sources in order to obtain the infamous and discredited Trump “dossier.” The Federal Election Campaign Act (52 USC 30101) prohibits foreign nationals and governments from giving or receiving money in U.S. campaigns. It also prohibits the filing of false or misleading campaign reports to hide the true purpose of the money (52 USC 30121). This is what Clinton and the DNC appear to have done.

Most often the penalty for violating this law is a fine, but in egregious cases, like this one, criminal prosecutions have been sought and convictions obtained. In this sense, it could be said that Hillary Clinton is the one who was conspiring with the Russians by breaking campaign finance laws with impunity.

But that’s not all. Damning new evidence appears to show that Clinton used her office as Secretary of State to confer benefits to Russia in exchange for millions of dollars in donations to her foundation and cash to her husband. Secret recordings, intercepted emails, financial records, and eyewitness accounts allegedly show that Russian nuclear officials enriched the Clintons at the very time Hillary presided over a governing body which unanimously approved the sale of one-fifth of America’s uranium supply to Russia.

If this proves to be a corrupt “pay-to-play” scheme, it would constitute a myriad of crimes, including bribery (18 USC 201-b), mail fraud (18 USC 1341), and wire fraud (18 USC 1343). It might also qualify for racketeering charges (18 USC 1961-1968), if her foundation is determined to have been used as a criminal enterprise.

Despite all the incriminating evidence, Clinton has managed to avoid being pursued by a special counsel. Trump, on the other hand, is being chased by Robert Mueller and his team, notwithstanding a dearth of evidence.

Robert Mueller

The indictments of Manafort and Gates now present a unique opportunity to challenge the authority of the special counsel.

Until now, no one had legal “standing” to argue in court that the appointment of Mueller was illegal. The criminal charges change all that. The two defendants will be able to argue before a judge that Mueller’s appointment by Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein violated the special counsel law.

As I pointed out in a column last May , the law (28 CFR 600) grants legal authority to appoint a special counsel to investigate crimes. Only crimes. He has limited jurisdiction. Yet, in his order appointing Mueller as special counsel (Order No. 3915-2017), Rosenstein directed him to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.” It fails to identify any specific crimes, likely because none are applicable.

To put it plainly, Mueller is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law. It is a legal impossibility. He is being asked to do something that is manifestly unattainable.

If the federal judge agrees, Mueller and his team would be disbanded by judicial order. The Department of Justice would have to seek a new indictment of Manafort and Gates without the special counsel or drop the case entirely.

The naming of Robert Mueller was tainted with disqualifying conflicts of interest from the beginning. Fired FBI Director James Comey admitted he leaked presidential memos to the media for the sole purpose of triggering the appointment of a special counsel who just happens to be Comey’s longtime friend, ally and partner.

It is no coincidence that Rosenstein appointed Mueller. We now know both men were overseeing the corrupt Uranium One sale which involved Russian bribes, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering. They appear to have kept it secret, even hiding it from Congress which would surely have cancelled the transaction involving a vital national security asset. A cover-up? It has the stench of one.

How can Americans have confidence in the outcome of the Trump-Russia matter if the integrity and impartiality of Mueller and Rosenstein has been compromised by their suspected cover-up of the Clinton-Russia case? Both men should resign.

Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiava were standing with the USS Ashland's commanding officer and others high on the bridgeway when the ship arrived at White Beach Naval Facility in Okinawa, five days after it picked up the women and their two dogs from their boat, 900 miles southeast of Japan.

Appel and Fuiava had left Honolulu on May 3 aboard Appel's 50-foot vessel the Sea Nymph for what was supposed to be an 18-day trip to Tahiti.

Storms flooded the engine and damaged the mast and sails so badly, they couldn't generate enough wind power to stay on course. They drifted aimlessly and sent unanswered distress calls for 98 consecutive days.

They were thousands of miles in the wrong direction when a Taiwanese fishing vessel found them. Towing the sailboat damaged it further, but Appel swam to the Taiwanese vessel to make a mayday call.

They'd run out of food for the dogs, and the woman began sharing their own, leaving their food supply 90 percent depleted by the time they were rescued.

The USS Ashland on Wednesday picked up the women, plus the dogs Zeus and Valentine, all four looking remarkably fit for having been lost at sea for nearly six months.

Appel told reporters on Friday that they were beginning to believe they were completely out of luck when they saw the U.S. Navy ship chugging toward them.

""When I saw the gray ship on the horizon, I was just shaking,"" she said then. ""I was ready to cry, I was so happy. I knew we were going to live.""

Although Appel has been sailing the Hawaiian islands for 10 years and spent two years preparing for this voyage, she acknowledged she and Fuiava, a novice sailor, may not have prepared as well as they could have.

Appel credited their survival in part to the veteran sailors in Hawaii who had warned them to prepare well for their journey.

In fact, they may not even have windows and instead seal military personnel inside a closed cockpit to better protect them against threats.

But how could they see the battlefield around them without windows? To see outside, Soldiers could use a new technology made by Honeywell that lets them “see” with virtual reality and augmented reality.

Using a headset and a wraparound display, drivers are given the effect of “seeing” beyond the armor to the war zone around them. The augmented reality even enhances their “sight” by overlaying crucial information like enemy movements and safe routes ahead.

This remarkable advance is part of the DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) initiative that could lead to an entirely new era of tanks and armored combat vehicles. GXV-T would offer tank-like protection on a vehicle that resembles a futuristic All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) but is smaller than a traditional tank.

SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR

DARPA awarded eight contracts to work on the exciting, groundbreaking GXV-T. Honeywell is one of these companies.

Recently, Honeywell successfully tested this window-free tech on a tough, off-road desert course at speeds of more than 35mph. The drivers successfully maneuvered the course from inside the closed cockpit relying on the “sight” provided by the virtual reality system.

Unsurprisingly, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are already interested in DARPA’s vision for this radical new vehicle. The GXV-T would provide the U.S. military with enormous advantages over adversaries.

Far Better Armor

The big advantage to no windows? Keep US military personnel inside a whole lot safer.

Another research thrust for DARPA on the GXV-T project is radically overhauling the approach to armor. For more than a century, the approach has been more armor equals more protection.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

There are, however, tradeoffs to more armor, such as adding more weight, which means less speed and agility. These capabilities can be essential in some scenarios so finding the right balance between the armor trade-offs is never easy.

But with GXV-T, the goal is a closed cockpit that allows reactive armor to enhance safety on the outside. Reactive armor detects threats and reacts. So, for example, when it anticipates the impact of a threat like an RPG, this armor would be able to shift and concentrate in the area it will impact.

Without the windows, it may be possible to do far more with less armor and still offer far better protection.

PODCAST: VAMPIRE BATS V. NAVY SEALS. INSIDE JUNGLE WARFARE WITH SEAL TEAM 6

How does it work?

Honeywell harnessed its experience with aircraft cockpits and applied it to creating a GXV-T “cockpit.”

Cameras and sensors fixed on the vehicle feed data to onboard computers. These stitch together the data into one cohesive image and the wraparound internal screens display this imagery.

WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?

The operator dons the special virtual and augmented reality headset and when that is combined with the panoramic screen it creates the effect of “seeing” outside the vehicle – whilst safely inside a closed cockpit.

Already, Honeywell’s virtual landscape allows an operator to off-road at realistic speeds. This set of initial tests were conducted with 160-degree views. DARPA’s aim is for a 360-degree view and although it may seem impossible, it may be possible to achieve that.

Motion sickness and eye strain are two common complaints and tough challenges for companies working to advance virtual reality. Honeywell seems to have cracked these pesky problems because the feedback thus far has been very positive with drivers not suffering from either complaint.

Augmented Reality View

Safety and protection is paramount, but another key advantage to this revolutionary approach is providing operators with enhanced “sight.” With augmented reality, operators can have crucial data overlaid as well.

Already, Honeywell has been able to build in speed, heading, and position data augmentation. But lots of further symbols could be added to further assist driver’s during their missions.

AUSA 2017: 4 AMAZING LAND VEHICLES AT THIS YEAR’S SHOW

Enemy movements, the best routes to avoid detection, upcoming difficult terrain, threat detection – these are just a few examples of useful data that could augment what a driver “sees.” Enhanced situational awareness will also improve safety for personnel.

In many ways, this is very similar to the data displayed in U.S. fighter pilots’ cockpits, but would now be available to ground forces in closed cockpits.

PODCAST: LEARN HOW TO FLY A FIGHTER JET WITH A FASCINATING FIGHTER PILOT

What is GXV-T?

DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) is advancing tech for combat in many ways. Overall, the goal is to produce smarter, faster and more agile vehicles for the future force.

Another area that will increase protection, for example, is the progress being made to develop the GXV-T as ultra-stealthy.

ATHENA LASER WEAPON 'KILLS' 5 'OUTLAWS'

Tanks are not exactly known for being stealthy. But imagine if the military could have a vehicle with tank protection, but fighter jet stealth? Advances are being made in tech for the GXV-T to evade detection by the enemy from acoustic and electromagnetic methods through to infrared.

A new kind of driving

For the military, these kinds of big breakthroughs could pave the way to the future force taking tanks into battle that have remarkable advantages like this virtual and augmented reality and futuristic reactive armor. This would turn them into much lighter and far more agile vehicles, while providing even more protection for U.S. troops.

PERDUE TO CHANGE CHICKEN-SLAUGHTERING PRACTICES, INTRODUCE 'GAS STUNNING' AT FACILITIES

McDonald's suppliers will also be required to start gassing the chickens prior to slaughter — a process called ""stunning"" — which will render the slaughtering process painless, the L.A. Times reported. The Times also said that, prior to these guidelines, some suppliers would shock the livestock before cutting their throats.

“We believe these new commitments provide the ability to drive and measure continuous improvement for the health and welfare of chickens,” Bruce Feinberg, a senior director at McDonald’s who oversees chicken, beef, pork, fish and dairy products, wrote in an announcement.

McDonald’s suppliers, such as Tyson Foods Inc and Cargill Inc., must comply with the new standards by 2024. They’ll also be conducting trials with the restaurant to measure the well-being of different chicken breeds, Reuters reports.

“I think it’s one of the most comprehensive programs that I’ve seen for chickens,” said livestock researcher Temple Grandin, who pioneered humane slaughterhouse practices and works with McDonald‘s.

Fortunately for consumers, these changes aren’t expected to raise the cost of McDonald’s chicken menu items, like McNuggets, Buttermilk Chicken Tenders and McChicken sandwiches. Despite the increased price of production, Feinberg told Reuters that these new regulations might help customers “make purchasing decisions that they might not have otherwise made.”

However, animal activists argue McDonald’s new regulations don’t stack up to those of other fast-food restaurants like Burger King and Subway, Feedstuffs reports. They argue that the chain’s plan doesn’t address their primary concern of chickens that grow too quickly, which can lead to organ failure and difficulty walking because they’re too heavy.

Josh Balk, vice president of Farm Animal Protection for The Human Society of the United States said in a statement to Fox News, “McDonald’s announcement misses the mark on meaningfully addressing the worst animal suffering for chickens in its supply chain, stemming from how birds are genetically manipulated to grow so big, so fast they often cripple underneath their unnaturally obese bodies.""

FlaxseedsKnown as one of the best ways to improve digestive health or relieve constipation, flaxseeds are a good source of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.
Decreased inflammation in the digestive tract means less stress on the bowel, which can help decrease constipation.
Plus, pears are high in pectin, a form of fiber that is particularly helpful for constipation.","Most of us experience constipation once in a while. Not only is it uncomfortable, the condition can also cause irritability, fatigue and bloating. If you suffer from constipation more than occasionally, or the problem includes severe pain or bleeding, check with your doctor to see if something more serious is going on. While there are several causes for constipation, what you eat (lots of fiber!) and drink (lots of water!) can help get things moving. In addition to drinking plenty of water, which will help make your bowel movements softer and easier to pass, here are five foods to add to your grocery list for a happier pit stop.

Mangos

The most popular fruit in the world, mangos are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, as well as fiber to aid digestion. But it might be more than the fiber in mangos that helps get things moving. A recent study conducted at Texas A&M University found that people with chronic constipation supplemented with a mango supplement (the equivalent of one medium-sized mango a day) showed a more significant reduction in constipation in a four-week period compared to people receiving a non-mango fiber supplement. The researchers believe the phytochemicals in mango pulp were responsible for the better response on constipation, as well as inflammatory markers.

Flaxseeds

Known as one of the best ways to improve digestive health or relieve constipation, flaxseeds are a good source of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. In one small study, 55 people with constipation caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) found that those who took flaxseeds not only reduced constipation but also showed a reduction in abdominal pain and bloating as compared to those who used psyllium (a fiber supplement). Like all sources of fiber, drink lots of water when consuming flaxseed and if you choose to include them in your diet, gradually work your way up to 2 tablespoons per day. Since our bodies can’t break down the whole seed, grind them (you can use a coffee grinder) directly before adding them to your food to get the most nutrients.

Broccoli

A powerhouse of nutrients, broccoli also contains fiber for digestive health. In addition, broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables contain an antioxidant called sulforaphane, which has been shown to lower the risk of chronic inflammation and help protect the lining of the stomach from bacterial overgrowth. Decreased inflammation in the digestive tract means less stress on the bowel, which can help decrease constipation.

Yogurt

Yogurt contains tens of millions of live beneficial bacteria called probiotics. Probiotics promote a healthy gut while decreasing inflammation. A research review of 14 studies published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that on average, probiotics slowed “gut transit time” by 12.4 hours, increased the number of weekly bowel movements by 1.3, and helped soften stools, making them easier to pass. You can also get probiotics in fermented foods like Kefir, sauerkraut and kimchi.

Pears

If you’re feeling constipated and bloated, you’re going to want to keep the skin on these sweet treats. The skin of the pear has been shown to have about half of the pear’s total fiber. The skin of the pear also contains three to four times as many antioxidants and anti-inflammatory flavonoids as the flesh of the pear alone. Plus, pears are high in pectin, a form of fiber that is particularly helpful for constipation.",5 foods that help relieve constipation,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/27/5-foods-that-help-relieve-constipation.html

The Washington Post reported Saturday that a panel called the Players Coalition has requested a meeting Monday in Philadelphia with league Commissioner Roger Goodell, Houston Texans owner Bob McNair, and free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

The Washington Post reported Saturday that a panel called the Players Coalition has requested a meeting Monday in Philadelphia with league Commissioner Roger Goodell, Houston Texans owner Bob McNair, and free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

It wasn’t immediately clear if all parties had agreed to attend.

Meanwhile, ESPN reported Saturday that the Houston Texans players were planning to stage an unspecified protest against McNair's remarks prior to Sunday's game against the Seahawks in Seattle.

“Many players have been deeply troubled by the disturbing comments made by Texans' owner Bob McNair,” the Players Coalition said in a statement. “It is ironic that such a quote would emerge in the midst of an ongoing struggle to highlight injustices suffered by people of color, including our nation's deeply flawed approach to criminal justice and inhumane treatment of imprisoned people.”

McNair has apologized twice since making what he described as a “very regretful comment” during a recent league meeting about players’ national anthem protests. The comment was published in ESPN The Magazine.

But McNair insisted afterward that he wasn’t referring to the players as “inmates” when he said, “We can’t have the inmates running the prison.” Instead, he said, he was describing the relationship between team owners and the league office in New York.

Nevertheless, in a league on edge over race-related matters -- sparked in large part by Kaepernick’s 2016 protests against American society’s treatment of people of color – the “inmates” remark wasn’t accepted well.

Last season Kaepernick, who was with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling during the national anthem before games, saying he was protesting police killings of African-Americans. But many critics argued that protesting during the anthem was disrespectful to the nation and especially the members of the U.S. military.

After President Donald Trump made a veiled reference to Kaepernick as a “son of a bitch” during a September speech in Alabama, more players joined the protest – even though Kaepernick was out of the league by then.

In their statement, the players asserted that McNair’s remark suggested that some league officials were not taking their concerns seriously.

“As long as the prevailing reality of our league includes a culture where owners feel such behavior and language is permissible, our cause will continue to be stifled and progress will remain elusive,” the statement said. “This isn't about being a player or a club owner - but basic human decency.”

According to ESPN, the Players Coalition is led by Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, retired wide receiver Anquan Boldin and other players who are engaged in community activism.","NFL players seek meeting with Goodell, McNair, Kaepernick",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/29/nfl-players-seek-meeting-with-goodell-mcnair-kaepernick.html

Hysteria over petty issues like Halloween costumes will continue as long as the politics of white guilt pervades American culture.
Instead of trying to pit us against each other while raising the banner of “social justice,” concerned citizens should not waste time determining the political correctness of children’s costumes.","Halloween is almost here – and a costume for little girls has prompted oh-so sensitive and oh-so politically correct progressives to get all worked up over cultural appropriation, white privilege and the oppression of minorities.

With all the problems in the world, some folks are focusing on whether it’s OK for girls who are not Polynesian to dress up as Moana – the beloved Disney character in an animated film of the same name who is the daughter a Polynesian chief.

The great debate was sparked by Sachi Feris, a mother who wrote on the blog Raising Race Conscious Children that she would refuse to dress her white daughter as Moana for Halloween for fear of “cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty.”

The New York Post, People, Redbook and other websites quickly wrote about this burning issue of our times. In calling on parents to use Halloween as an opportunity “to teach your kids about the importance of cultural sensitivity” the Redbook article (also published in Cosmopolitan) admonished moms and dads: “If your kid wears a racist costume … you’re kind of wearing it too.”

Taking advantage of the collective guilt felt about our nation’s past sins, many white liberals respond with an oversensitivity to any potential act of racism today. That’s why they go around tilting at windmills, claiming to be the “good guys” on the side of justice.

The message of political correctness gone wild is clear: the Moana costume is racist and you are a bad parent if you allow your child to wear it.

And Halloween outrage and hyperventilation isn’t just for kids. It’s open for all ages. Adult-toddlers in American universities might be equally offended this season as well. So, our nation’s institutions of higher learning are taking necessary precautions.

Tufts University encouraged its students to report any “inappropriate and offensive costume” to the police. Violators could be subject to an investigation by campus police and potentially face “serious disciplinary sanctions.”

Tufts campus police will surely welcome the opportunity to crack down on the costume crime wave, including “costumes that appropriate cultures and reproduce stereotypes on race, gender, sexuality, immigrant or socioeconomic status” or relate to “tragedy, controversy or acts of violence.” That sweeping definition is broad enough to cover just about any costume – maybe even some everyday clothing.

The University of Texas issued a 29-point checklist about offensive Halloween costumes.

And Princeton University’s Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding held a “dialogue” about “why culture is not a costume.”

What’s next? Perhaps mandatory DNA testing to determine who is allowed to wear what on Halloween?

Extreme as campus political correctness sounds – and as ridiculous as the Moana outrage is –both make sense when placed in the context of white-guilt politics.

Acclaimed race relations scholar Shelby Steele defines white guilt as “the vacuum of moral authority that comes from simply knowing that one’s race is associated with racism.” Thus, for many Americans, “their white guilt wants no obligation to minority development. It needs only the display of social justice to win moral authority.”

Taking advantage of the collective guilt felt about our nation’s past sins, many white liberals respond with an oversensitivity to any potential act of racism today. That’s why they go around tilting at windmills, claiming to be the “good guys” on the side of justice. Any manufactured cause, from Disney costumes to campus “safe spaces,” is an opportunity for them to win moral authority.

Here’s the problem:

First, these left-wing “activists” only need the appearance of social justice to meet their objective. The results of their work don’t matter. It doesn’t matter that their identity politics has led to more division in our country. They don’t care about the long-term effects of bad government policies on underprivileged communities, so long as politicians can say they developed a new program.

It doesn’t matter how minority students perform in their universities, so long as the photo-ops make their campuses look diverse. They’ve completely embraced the idea of perception as reality, so actual reality is immaterial to them.

Secondly, a nation mired in guilt from its past can’t unite in the future. While it’s important that we learn from the lessons of history, we must acknowledge that we can’t atone for them.

As famed economist and philosopher Thomas Sowell wrote: “Galling as it may be to be helpless to redress the crying injustices of the past, symbolic expiation in the present can only create new injustices among the living.” If we see everything through prism of our racist past, we can’t work together for a better tomorrow.

And by the way, in case any readers think Shelby Steele, Thomas Sowell and I are a bunch of insensitive white racists, please be advised that all of us are black.

Hysteria over petty issues like Halloween costumes will continue as long as the politics of white guilt pervades American culture. While good-hearted families celebrate with their loved ones on Tuesday, any costume that can be misconstrued as insensitive racially, culturally or in some other way will be attacked on social media by people who make a living off dividing our nation.

Instead of trying to pit us against each other while raising the banner of “social justice,” concerned citizens should not waste time determining the political correctness of children’s costumes. Together, Americans of good will from every background imaginable should focus on what unites us and build a better future for us all and for our children.",Halloween: Progressive pitchforks are out to destroy what ought to be a fun holiday,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/halloween-progressive-pitchforks-are-out-to-destroy-what-ought-to-be-fun-holiday.html

Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their work in Ukraine.

The indictment says that Manafort and Gates laundered the money through scores of the United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts in order to hide Ukraine payments from U.S. authorities.

More than $75 million flowed through offshore accounts. Manafort, alone, allegedly laundered more than $18 million which was used by the former Trump campaign chairman to buy property, goods, and services in the U.S., while concealing that income from the U.S. Treasury and the Department of Justice.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

“The university acknowledges that this installation will provoke a range of reactions, including offense at the use of the American Flag and use of the KKK and Nazi symbols.","A Florida professor sparked outrage after she transformed three American flags into Ku Klux Klan hoods.

The flags shaped like KKK hoods had the eyes burnt out with nothing but darkness behind them and sat on poles with bases shaped like Nazi swastikas. The artwork is part of the University of Miami’s annual faculty art show, gallery director Milly Cardoso told the Miami New Times.

Billie Grace Lynn, a University of Miami associate professor of sculpture, calls it “American Mask,” a work, she writes on her personal site, that suggests “bigotry and racism are hiding behind our flag.”

“This is disgusting. This is disrespectful,” Patrick Young, a black employee who works in the same building as the UM art gallery, told WSVN. “I can’t see it being a positive message any way you put it.”

The artwork, which will be on display until Nov. 12, has angered many who say it defaces the American flag and is outright offensive.

“What can this actually help?” Young said. “Burning an American flag? I have no idea what this symbolizes, what this helps out. Who does this reach?”

Lynn told the University of Miami News this was the intent of her piece – to strike up conversation.

She said she was talking to a construction worker who was angry about her artwork – and she was able to explain its meaning.

“I asked him what he thought it meant and he said, ‘It’s racist.’ And I said, ‘Well, it is racist, it’s about racism. It’s about people hiding their racism behind the flag, behind their patriotism.’ Instantly all of his angry energy dissipated as he had this realization. This is what democracy is. It’s messy business and it requires us to talk with each other.”

The UM professor and artist said she was inspired to create the piece after watching people walking with American and Nazi flags during the protests in Charlottesville, Va.

“I just thought, that’s what needs to be protested—that the American flag is positioned in between those two symbols of hatred and racism,” she said. “If there was ever a time to show this work, it’s now.”

While the university said it supports “artistic expression and freedom of speech,” UM officials acknowledge that this is an off-campus gallery that wasn’t pre-approved or reviewed by the administration.

UM hopes that “conservations can happen in ways that are respectful of all points of view,” UM wrote in a statement to Fox News. “The university acknowledges that this installation will provoke a range of reactions, including offense at the use of the American Flag and use of the KKK and Nazi symbols. Art exhibits that provoke reaction and conversation are not new, nor the unique province of the University of Miami.”

UNIVERSITIES ISSUE GUIDES, THREATS, AND COUNSELING FOR ‘OFFENSIVE’ HALLOWEEN COSTUMES

Lynn told the Miami New Times she is “from Louisiana, and the Klan is really strong there. I am from the place where these people live. I am these people in some way.”

She finds her artwork offensive and hopes to “awaken citizens to the danger of confusing bigotry with patriotism.”

As a former Girl Scout, who was taught never to let the American flag touch the ground, Lynn told the university publication it wasn’t easy for her to create the artwork.

“It was very painful for me to cut the flag to make it into that shape. But I think that’s what’s happening, the country is in pain,” she told UM News, adding, “I don’t want the American flag to be taken as a symbol for white supremacy, and I think that is what’s happening and that’s a dark path to go down.”",Miami art professor turns American flags into KKK hoods causing outrage,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/30/miami-art-professor-turns-american-flags-into-kkk-hoods-causing-outrage.html

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

In 2016, Drivers in LA spent on average 81 hours in traffic, according to a story in The Los Angeles Times, which obtained the survey from data company Inrix.

In a separate tweet, Musk added that that the tunnel is 500 feet so far, but should be ""2 miles long in three or four months and hopefully stretch the whole 405 N-S corridor from [Los Angeles International Airport] LAX to the 101 in a year or so.""

In August, The Boring Company received approval by the city of Hawthorne (a city in southwestern Los Angeles County) to build the tunnel. The tunnel operates using electric skates, so that cars can move along swiftly.

In July, Musk showed off the elevator that would take cars from the congested roads to the underground network of tunnels.

In addition to the tunnel under LA, The Boring Company is also looking to have tunnels in other cities, including one stretching from Baltimore to New York (stopping in Washington and Philadelphia), as well as Chicago and other U.S. cities.

In addition to being CEO of The Boring Company, Musk is also the CEO of electric vehicle company Tesla, space exploration company SpaceX. He also co-founded artificial intelligence specialists Neuralink and OpenAI.

“I don’t know if my voice was very bad and that’s why I got the ticket, but I was very shocked,” Moalla told CTV News. “I understand if they are doing their job, they are allowed to check if everything’s okay, if I kidnapped someone or if there’s danger inside but I would never expect they would give me a ticket for that.”

Moalla plans to contest the ticket, CTV News reported.",Montreal man receives ticket after singing while driving,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/23/montreal-man-receives-ticket-after-singing-while-driving.html

TMZ reported Monday that former employee Becky Steenhoek is going after Warner Bros. Entertainment, as well as several producers from the show, insisting they asked her sexually invasive questions multiple times during 2016 that had nothing to do with the reality series.

“You could visibly tell it was very uncomfortable for me to witness, just because they did make comments like, ‘Oh, Becky’s blushing,’ or ‘Her ears are probably burning,'” the 31-year-old told Los Angeles Times. “It was a bit of a theme that carried on throughout the season… It was a fun time for them to see me get embarrassed.”

TMZ added that Steenhoek claimed the questions were aimed to humiliate her due to her “sexual inexperience and conservative views about sex.” Steenhoek insisted she was fired a week after speaking out.

“When I was hired for the job, the reason they told me I was being hired because I did have the morals and they felt I was a good person,” she explained. “And then here I am being fired because of that reason.”

The Los Angeles Times also revealed Steenhoek “was raised in a Christian household.”

Lt. Steven Arango was attending Bates College in Maine, when he read a New York Times article that inspired him.

The article profiled Captain George Whitney, 38, a Bates College alumnus and a C.I.A paramilitary officer who was killed in December in Afghanistan.

“After I read about him, I knew right away that Bates needed to honor him,” Arango said to ConnectingVets.com.

Whitney excelled both academically and athletically at Bates College; he graduated cum laude after playing football as the starting fullback. After college, Whitney joined the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, serving in Anbar, Iraq. He then joined the C.I.A, but was killed in action during an operation in Afghanistan.

Whitney, along with two others, was awarded stars from the C.I.A for dying in the line of duty.

“He epitomized selfless service and gave his life in protection of our country,” Arango said. “Simply put, he’s a hero.”

Inspired by Whitney’s heroism, Arango petitioned Bates College to honor his legacy.

Arango decided that a sculpted bust would be the perfect tribute to Whitney, and contracted the help of retired USMC Colonel and Alabama artist Lee Busby.

Also a University of Alabama graduate, Busby sculpts Alabamians who have been killed in Iraq of Afghanistan.

""I'm no Michelangelo, but I know the world that these people operate in, and I know what they went through,” Busby told Southern Living. “And, I do have some ability to sculpt. So, that's what I want to do.""

Now, Busby is nearly halfway done with the bust of Whitney and is ready to sculpt the finishing touches.

“We are flying Caryn Whitney into Tuscaloosa to put the final touches on the bust,” Arango said. “We want to make sure the likeness is exactly of her son.”

Busby expects to complete the sculpture by December, which then will be used for pouring — the process used to make a bronze bust.

Arango is funding this project completely alone, and hopes that Bates College can provide space for the memorial.

“I just want Captain Whitney to be honored,” Arango said. “For the next 100, 200 years with Bates students walking next to him and seeing him? I promise you Bates will turn out even better students than they are now.”

Dennis and Lorraine Carver died after their vehicle crashed into a metal gate outside their community in Riverside County on Oct. 16 and burst into flames, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. It took firefighters about an hour to extinguish the flames, the local fire department said.

“After the shooting, they heard from all of the people they cared about most. They were so happy,” Brooke Carver, 20, their daughter, told the newspaper. “The last two weeks of their lives were really just spent living in the moment.”

The couple’s youngest daughter, 16-year-old Madison, heard a loud bang outside her window the night of the accident and ran down the street to see her parents’ vehicle engulfed in flames, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

The couple had been together 22 years and had managed to escape the Route 91 Harvest music festival slaughter uninjured.

Dennis Carver had jumped on Lorraine after realizing the gunshots weren’t fireworks, and the pair made a run for it, hand in hand, during the third or fourth lull in Paddock’s firing spree, Brooke Carver said.

“That’s just the kind of love they had for each other,” she added. “Their love was selfless.”

Dennis Carver got roses for Lorraine after the attack, and a month later, even though they are dried up, not a single petal from them has fallen.

“It’s almost as if they’re frozen in time,” Brooke Carver told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “We’re so lucky we have those flowers to remind us of them.”

Two months ago, Donald Trump argued against tearing down Confederate statues by saying , “George Washington was a slave owner… So, will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down statues to George Washington?” This question began another oh-so-predictable round of ritualistic media eyerolling.

That same tone Andy Griffith uses to explain to Opie why he has to work for his quarter-a-week allowance. Sit on our collective knee, Mr. President, while we impart some grown-up knowledge.

Now, less than three months later, it turns out George Washington is a safe-space ruining, bubble-popping, micro-aggressor after all. That’s why the Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia—a church Washington attended for two decades—has decided to remove a small memorial marking the pew where the father of our country worshipped. According to a Fox News article, leaders of the Church said, “The plaques in our sanctuary make some in our presence feel unsafe or unwelcome.” That’s right!

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid announced that King is suffering from heart and kidney problems, often losing consciousness.

“We have periodically tried to treat and care for him but since we are facing war conditions and do not readily have access to health facilities therefore we are unable to deliver complete treatment,"" the statement read according to CBS.

As a result, the Taliban is urging the United States to meet the group’s demands, adding that if ""the illness of Kevin King becomes incurable or he loses his life... (we) will not be held responsible.""

In August of last year, King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were captured by the Taliban outside of the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, where the two were teaching.

In response to the Taliban’s statement on Monday, the University said in a statement that both King and Weeks are “innocent victims of criminal abduction.”

“They came to Afghanistan to teach Afghan youth and contribute to building a peaceful Afghanistan. They have done no harm to anyone. We strongly urge the Taliban immediately to release Mr. King and Mr. Weeks unharmed,” the statement reads.

As the two professors continue to be held hostage, here’s what to know:

The kidnapping

King, 61, and Weeks, 49, were kidnapped in Kabul by five gunmen in August 2016. The two were reportedly taken from their SUV on a main road near the University. According to a Guardian report at the time, the men were thought to be traveling from the school toward their residence.

King and Weeks are believed to be held by the Afghan Taliban-linked Haqqani network.

U.S. SERVICE MEMBER DIES IN AFGHANISTAN HELICOPTER CRASH

The Haqqani network was also behind the kidnapping of Caitlan Coleman and Joshua Boyle-- a U.S/Canadian couple who was released earlier in October when they were rescued by Pakistani forces. The couple was captured in 2012 and had three children while in captivity.

What’s happened since Kings and Weeks were captured?

Since their capture, the Taliban has released two videos of Kings and Weeks. The first, which was released in January on YouTube, shows the two in an undisclosed location asking then President-elect Trump for a prisoner exchange.

“If we stay here for much longer, we will be killed. I don’t want to die here,” Weeks said in the video.

“Donald Trump, sir, I ask you, please. This is in your hands. I ask you please to negotiate with the Taliban. If you do not negotiate with them, we will be killed,” he added.

In the second video, which was released in June, the two re-iterate their plea for a prisoner exchange on behalf of their captors.

“My captors treat me well. They treat me and my colleague Tim Weeks as their guests; but every prisoner’s final wish is to get freedom from the prison,” King said in June.

The U.S. government has previously agreed to Taliban demands of a prisoner swap. In 2014, the Haqqani group released Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban prisoners.

Prior to his capture, Bergdahl walked off his post in Afghanistan in 2009. Bergdahl has since pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.

What’s been the response from the U.S. and Australia?

There has been at least one attempt by U.S. forces to rescue King and Weeks, but it was unsuccessful.

A team of Navy Seals reportedly invaded a militant hideout in the mountains in eastern Afghanistan, missing the two hostages by just a few hours, according to the Guardian.

“We call for the immediate and unconditional release of Kevin King and all other hostages,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State told Fox News in a statement on Monday.

AFGHAN OFFICIAL: TALIBAN KILL 9 POLICE IN CHECKPOINT ATTACK

“Taking and holding hostages is reprehensible and we condemn such actions in the strongest terms. The U.S. government will never stop trying to recover them and other Americans held by criminal and terrorist networks around the world. We adopt a whole-of-government approach to recover U.S. citizen hostages abroad, and we leverage all diplomatic, military, investigative, and intelligence elements in support of our recovery efforts.”

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families involved. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment,” the spokesperson added.

It is currently unclear if Trump will adhere to the Taliban's request for a prisoner swap.

After the release of the first video in January, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the Australian Financial Review that the “Australian government has been working closely with other governments to secure the release of an Australian man kidnapped in Afghanistan in August 2016. We have also been providing consular support to the man's family, who have requested privacy. Out of respect for his family's wishes, and in the interests of his own safety and well-being, we will not be commenting further.""",Taliban hostages Kevin King and Timothy Weeks: What to know,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/30/taliban-hostages-kevin-king-and-timothy-weeks-what-to-know.html

Reuer made headlines earlier this week after revealing she dropped nearly 80 pounds during the last two years and successfully completed a Tough Mudder race in June.

The 67-year-old now weighs 120 pounds but was once 198. She told Fox News on Friday that she started her wellness journey by cutting out carbs, sugar and rice. But her initial goal wasn’t necessarily to lose weight, she said. Rather, the Farmington Hills, Mich. resident just wanted to live a healthier lifestyle.

“I’m one of six siblings, and the other five have significant health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. While I hadn’t developed any of those things, I knew I would if I didn’t change how I was eating,” she said.

She also said her job encouraged her to better her lifestyle. Reuer is the CEO of Dryer Vent Wizard, a dryer vent cleaning service. She described her job as “high-stress.”

“To keep doing it as I get older, I knew I needed to be in a better condition than I was two years ago,” she said.

Just by changing her eating habits, Reuer quickly dropped 50 pounds. “When I started to lose weight, it was fun,” she said.

Even though she was thinner, Reuer said she still felt self-conscious about going to the gym at first -- wary of other gym-goers who might watch or judge her.

When she did start going, “I couldn't do push up or pull ups, and I was sore and tired,” she said.

But Reuer was determined to get stronger-- eventually hiring a personal trainer to help her on her fitness journey. As she slowly built up her strength and stamina, people started to take note.

A month after she started working out, Reuer said that Jason Kapica, the executive vice president of Dryer Vent Wizard, asked her to take part in a Tough Mudder race-- a 10 to 12 mile endurance race where participants run, scale walls, climb ropes, and more. Kapica wanted to raise money for the Children’s Burn Foundation, he told her.

At first, Reuer was hesitant to enter the competition.

“I told him I’ve never done anything like that,” she said. “I thought it was funny he even asked.”

Reuer told Kapica that she would support him and the company would sponsor him-- but she wasn’t going to take part.

But her outlook changed when she thought about the children she would be helping by participating in the race. While working with her trainer one day, Reuer made it official.

“My trainer looked at me and said, ‘OK-- we have some work to do.’”

For the next nine months, Reuer went to the gym six days a week. As the race got closer, she went two times a day, six days a week.

“I just kept thinking about trying to help these kids,” Reuer said.

Before she knew it, it was race day.

“I remember thinking: ‘What am I doing here?’” Reuer said. But all her pre-race jitters vanished after she starting running-- successfully taking on many of the obstacles even after a fellow racer told her she looked “too frail” to climb one of the walls.

“I may have white hair, but that’s an assumption I would never make about someone,” she said.

The race may be over, but that’s not stopping Reuer from maintaining her fitness journey. Reuer is still working with a trainer and continues to go to the gym six days a week.

Reuer said her weight loss has inspired others around her—her husband and many of her employees have embraced their own wellness journeys and lost weight as a result.

In addition, her company now offers free personal trainer sessions to employees. Employees can also use an hour of their work day to go to the gym, she said.

“That has been the most fun thing and has made the proudest,” she said.

As for her next goal? Reuer wants to tackle some of the Tough Mudder obstacles she wasn’t quite strong enough to conquer the first time round, so she plans on participating in the race again this summer. Other than that, she wants to make sure she doesn’t become part of the 65 percent of dieters who eventually return to their pre-diet weight.

And a new special counsel should be appointed – this time to investigate Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump.","Over the weekend, the mainstream media was absolutely giddy with delight upon learning there would be an indictment by special counsel, Robert Mueller.

This was proof positive, they insisted, that Trump “colluded” with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Their exuberance was the equivalent of a two day-long tailgate party. Too bad it was premature.

Manafort & Gates

The celebration came to a crashing end when the indictments of Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, were unsealed Monday morning. It turns out the charges are, basically, a tax fraud case. The two men stand accused of hiding their income from their lobbying work for Ukraine in order to avoid paying taxes, then lying about it. That’s it.

The 31-page indictment makes no mention of Trump or Russia or “collusion.” The media seemed as dejected as a kid who wakes up on Christmas morning, only to find there are no presents under the tree. Gee whiz.

The truth is, it should have come as no surprise to anyone, much less the media, that Manafort was in legal jeopardy for his business dealings. The FBI raided his home over the summer. It was later learned that the FBI wiretapped his conversations as far back as 2014. And it was widely reported that Manafort had been told by Mueller’s team that he would be criminally charged.

It could be said that Hillary Clinton is the one who was conspiring with the Russians by breaking campaign finance laws with impunity.

The media became even more dispirited when they read through the indictment, discovering that nearly all of Manafort’s alleged wrongdoing substantially pre-dates his brief stint as chairman of the Trump campaign. In other words, there is no connection to either Trump or his campaign.

Somewhere, I’m sure, ABC’s Martha Raddatz and CNN’s Van Jones were crying. Again. Just like the tears they shed on camera election night when Hillary lost.

Papadopoulos

But wait. Shortly after the indictments were unsealed, the media’s spirits were suddenly boosted when the special counsel revealed that a former adviser to Trump pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian national during his time on the Trump campaign. Surely this was evidence of illegal “collusion,” right?

Wrong. George Papadopoulos pled guilty to a single charge of making a false statement to the FBI. He was not charged with so-called “collusion” because no such crime exists in American statutory law, except in anti-trust matters. It has no application to elections and political campaigns.

It is not a crime to talk to a Russian. Or, in Papadopoulos’s case, attempting to talk with a Russian through an intermediary. Not that the media would ever understand that. They have never managed to point to a single statute that makes “colluding” with a foreign government in a political campaign a crime, likely because it does not exist in the criminal codes.

To put it plainly, Mueller is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law. It is a legal impossibility. He is being asked to do something that is manifestly unattainable.

But that did not stop them from accusing Donald Trump, Jr., of illegally conspiring with the Russians when he met with a Russian lawyer to obtain information on Hillary Clinton. What law did he break? None. The Federal Election Commission has made it clear that it is perfectly lawful for foreign nationals to be involved in campaigns, as long as they are not paid and do not donate money. Which brings us to Hillary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton

It is against the law for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to funnel millions of dollars to a British spy and to Russian sources in order to obtain the infamous and discredited Trump “dossier.” The Federal Election Campaign Act (52 USC 30101) prohibits foreign nationals and governments from giving or receiving money in U.S. campaigns. It also prohibits the filing of false or misleading campaign reports to hide the true purpose of the money (52 USC 30121). This is what Clinton and the DNC appear to have done.

Most often the penalty for violating this law is a fine, but in egregious cases, like this one, criminal prosecutions have been sought and convictions obtained. In this sense, it could be said that Hillary Clinton is the one who was conspiring with the Russians by breaking campaign finance laws with impunity.

But that’s not all. Damning new evidence appears to show that Clinton used her office as Secretary of State to confer benefits to Russia in exchange for millions of dollars in donations to her foundation and cash to her husband. Secret recordings, intercepted emails, financial records, and eyewitness accounts allegedly show that Russian nuclear officials enriched the Clintons at the very time Hillary presided over a governing body which unanimously approved the sale of one-fifth of America’s uranium supply to Russia.

If this proves to be a corrupt “pay-to-play” scheme, it would constitute a myriad of crimes, including bribery (18 USC 201-b), mail fraud (18 USC 1341), and wire fraud (18 USC 1343). It might also qualify for racketeering charges (18 USC 1961-1968), if her foundation is determined to have been used as a criminal enterprise.

Despite all the incriminating evidence, Clinton has managed to avoid being pursued by a special counsel. Trump, on the other hand, is being chased by Robert Mueller and his team, notwithstanding a dearth of evidence.

Robert Mueller

The indictments of Manafort and Gates now present a unique opportunity to challenge the authority of the special counsel.

Until now, no one had legal “standing” to argue in court that the appointment of Mueller was illegal. The criminal charges change all that. The two defendants will be able to argue before a judge that Mueller’s appointment by Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein violated the special counsel law.

As I pointed out in a column last May , the law (28 CFR 600) grants legal authority to appoint a special counsel to investigate crimes. Only crimes. He has limited jurisdiction. Yet, in his order appointing Mueller as special counsel (Order No. 3915-2017), Rosenstein directed him to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.” It fails to identify any specific crimes, likely because none are applicable.

To put it plainly, Mueller is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law. It is a legal impossibility. He is being asked to do something that is manifestly unattainable.

If the federal judge agrees, Mueller and his team would be disbanded by judicial order. The Department of Justice would have to seek a new indictment of Manafort and Gates without the special counsel or drop the case entirely.

The naming of Robert Mueller was tainted with disqualifying conflicts of interest from the beginning. Fired FBI Director James Comey admitted he leaked presidential memos to the media for the sole purpose of triggering the appointment of a special counsel who just happens to be Comey’s longtime friend, ally and partner.

It is no coincidence that Rosenstein appointed Mueller. We now know both men were overseeing the corrupt Uranium One sale which involved Russian bribes, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering. They appear to have kept it secret, even hiding it from Congress which would surely have cancelled the transaction involving a vital national security asset. A cover-up? It has the stench of one.

How can Americans have confidence in the outcome of the Trump-Russia matter if the integrity and impartiality of Mueller and Rosenstein has been compromised by their suspected cover-up of the Clinton-Russia case? Both men should resign.

Lt. Steven Arango was attending Bates College in Maine, when he read a New York Times article that inspired him.

The article profiled Captain George Whitney, 38, a Bates College alumnus and a C.I.A paramilitary officer who was killed in December in Afghanistan.

“After I read about him, I knew right away that Bates needed to honor him,” Arango said to ConnectingVets.com.

Whitney excelled both academically and athletically at Bates College; he graduated cum laude after playing football as the starting fullback. After college, Whitney joined the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, serving in Anbar, Iraq. He then joined the C.I.A, but was killed in action during an operation in Afghanistan.

Whitney, along with two others, was awarded stars from the C.I.A for dying in the line of duty.

“He epitomized selfless service and gave his life in protection of our country,” Arango said. “Simply put, he’s a hero.”

Inspired by Whitney’s heroism, Arango petitioned Bates College to honor his legacy.

Arango decided that a sculpted bust would be the perfect tribute to Whitney, and contracted the help of retired USMC Colonel and Alabama artist Lee Busby.

Also a University of Alabama graduate, Busby sculpts Alabamians who have been killed in Iraq of Afghanistan.

""I'm no Michelangelo, but I know the world that these people operate in, and I know what they went through,” Busby told Southern Living. “And, I do have some ability to sculpt. So, that's what I want to do.""

Now, Busby is nearly halfway done with the bust of Whitney and is ready to sculpt the finishing touches.

“We are flying Caryn Whitney into Tuscaloosa to put the final touches on the bust,” Arango said. “We want to make sure the likeness is exactly of her son.”

Busby expects to complete the sculpture by December, which then will be used for pouring — the process used to make a bronze bust.

Arango is funding this project completely alone, and hopes that Bates College can provide space for the memorial.

“I just want Captain Whitney to be honored,” Arango said. “For the next 100, 200 years with Bates students walking next to him and seeing him? I promise you Bates will turn out even better students than they are now.”

The news comes after many fans called on Netflix to pull the plug on its original series following a report from Buzzfeed News in which actor Anthony Rapp alleged Spacey, then 26, made a sexual advance on him when he was 14 years old.

The decision to conclude ""House of Cards"" was made several months ago, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the decision.

However, a representitive for Netflix told Fox News earlier on Monday that the company is ""deeply troubled by last night’s news concerning Kevin Spacey. In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.”

Spacey released a statement admitting he didn’t remember the incident in question. In the statement, the 58-year-old star came out as a gay man.

Netflix made a big leap of faith in 2013 by making the scripted drama one of its first forays into the world of original programming. Today, Netflix is known for hit shows such as “Stranger Things,” “Narcos,” “13 Reasons Why,” “Orange is the New Black,” “Fuller House” and many more.

According to Entertainment Weekly, “House of Cards” recently began filming its sixth season. Several reports said the show was already considering making this season its last.

""[I]f I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior"" - Kevin Spacey

Rapp said that in 1986, Spacey, a fellow Broadway actor at the time, invited Rapp to his apartment for a party. Later in the evening, Spacey, then 26, allegedly “picked Rapp up, placed him on his bed, and climbed on top of him, making a sexual advance,” according to the Buzzfeed News report.

Rapp recalled he pushed Spacey off of him, went to a bathroom and closed the door, thinking: “What is happening?” He told Spacey he had to go home, to which Spacey allegedly asked if Rapp was “sure” he wanted to do that.

Rapp, who came forward less than a month after accusations against mega-producer Harvey Weinstein led to his Hollywood downfall, said he decided to speak out “not to simply air a grievance … but to try to shine another light on the decades of behavior that have been allowed to continue because many people, including myself, being silent.”

Spacey, early Monday, tweeted that he does not remember the alleged encounter, saying it would have been over 30 years ago.

“But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior,"" Spacey wrote. ""And I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.""

Those were the words of then-candidate Donald Trump during the first presidential debate of the 2016 race. It wasn’t the first time he’d used that line or some variation of it.

But it particularly stuck out to me that evening and it was the first thing that jumped to mind Monday morning when I woke up (I’m not an early riser, now you know) to the news that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his former business partner Rick Gates had been indicted on 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal and making false statements, amongst others. Former Trump advisor George Papadopolous has now pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI in the Mueller probe directly related to Russian interference.

It’s not a good day for Team Trump.

To this end, if you didn’t want to get bogged down in Manafort’s swamp and, more to the point, benefit from his connections in the Russian/Ukrainian sphere, he doesn’t seem like a great pick for campaign manager. I know options are limited when you’re running a campaign based on fear, nativism and general bullsh*t, but Manafort serves a very specific purpose: he is part of the underworld of politics where dealing with other Trump campaign standouts like Carter Page and Roger Stone (who I imagine will be getting knocks on their doors from FBI agents very soon) is normal.

But you don’t need me to talk you through the Russian collusion story and where we go from here. Mueller is clearly doing his job and I’d love to see someone prove that this grand jury was full of Democrat donors who are currently laughing on a yacht with Bill Clinton throwing back champagne and FaceTiming Obama.

So if you love Trump, take a day off from tweeting about Uranium One and process the gravity of what’s going on here. It’s a big deal.

What I do think you need to hear from me is how important it is to admit that our political heroes are fallible and may not be what we want them to be.

I’m well aware of the fact that no one who is reading this and has heard me on air is confused about my views on Donald Trump. He was never qualified to run for president and shows us this every day.

Nevertheless, I respect the fact that he’s a hero to millions of Americans. He certainly turned the system on its head, and since it’s agreed on both sides of the aisle that Washington is broken, I can see why a disruptor candidate could appeal. This particular one holds views abhorrent to me, but so it goes. It’s not like I’d have been voting for Marco Rubio either.

The point is that it’s okay to admit that your political heroes aren’t always what you thought they were. I’ve always known Hillary Clinton was flawed and have been quite happy to talk about it on TV, even on Fox News where if I criticize her, there isn’t going to be anyone around to defend her in my place.

I still remember the day I said out loud and on national television that it looked like Hillary had lied about Benghazi. While she refused to join the Sunday show circuit and it was clear blaming the YouTube video wasn’t her idea, the email to Chelsea telling her that it seemed the attack had been committed by an al Qaeda-like group indicated to me that she knew, at the very least, that the video wasn’t sole reason for the raid. Fog of war is a real thing, but it smelled bad to me so I said so.

My Twitter timeline lit up with a mix of compliments for being honest and the usual haters wondering when I was going to join “the dark side.” (By the way, the GOP really is the dark side and I’m never coming.)

But nothing had changed for me because I always knew that Hillary was human, just like the rest of us. She makes mistakes and she even apologizes for most of them. If you haven’t read her book, “What Happened,” it’s worth it just to see some of those apologies.

To err is human. And it looks like Trump is majorly human this morning as he entrusted his campaign to a foreign agent with clear ties to Russians who wanted Trump sitting right where he is right now. I also have no doubt we’ll learn of many more serious errors as the Mueller investigation rolls on.

So if you love Trump, take a day off from tweeting about Uranium One and process the gravity of what’s going on here. It’s a big deal.

I know why I’m still able to support Hillary after Benghazi and any other “scandal” right wingers drum up. It’s critical to always check one’s support and she passes the bar each time. I’m also happy to debate anyone on the merits of her platform and her career of service. Just name the time and place.

Trump supporters will have to go through that process as we see increasing evidence that Russia gave a little more than a wink and a nod to the Trump campaign.

Admitting the humanness of our heroes is freeing, I promise.","Hey, Trump fans: Manafort indictment means your hero isn't perfect (and that's OK)",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/30/hey-trump-fans-manafort-indictment-means-your-hero-isnt-perfect-and-thats-ok.html

""Some countries have manipulated U.N. sanctions resolutions against us and hindered the sovereign country's space development. It is not a tolerable act,"" the newspaper said. ""It is a global trend that a country seeks the economic growth with the space program.""

North Korea has made some strides in its space program since Kim Jong Un took power in 2011. North Korea successfully launched its first satellite in December 2012 after years of failures dating back to 1998. The satellite achieved stable orbit, but couldn't transmit data back to earth despite regime officials’ claims, Reuters reported. North Korea announced in February 2016 it launched a long-range rocket carrying a satellite. That launch occurred just weeks after conducting its fifth nuclear test.","North Korea Seeks To Develop Space Program, Vows To Launch More Satellites",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/30/north-korea-seeks-develop-space-program-vows-launch-more-satellites#commenting

Five hundred years on, the only viable Protestant future – the only evangelical future, the only future faithful to the Reformers’ vision – is a catholic future.","On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses, a list of propositions aimed at problems in the Roman Catholic Church, to the door of the university church in Wittenberg, Germany. He wanted to start a theological debate. Instead, he started the Reformation.

As Luther’s teaching reverberated through Europe, the aims of his followers expanded. According to historian Scott Hendrix, Protestants aspired to “re-Christianize” Europe.

Europe was already Christian, but in the Reformers’ judgment, its Christianity was skin-deep. Europe needed to recover the gospel, the “good news” about salvation through Jesus. The church, in other words, had to be overhauled by the gospel.

In many ways, the Reformation succeeded.

Catholic teaching had obscured the biblical message that salvation is God’s gift to sinners, not something earned by a pious, moral life. Protestant preachers proclaimed free grace.

Protestantism has a future only if we Protestants recover the original catholic vision of the Reformers. We need to take up the project of uniting and renewing the whole church.

Catholic clergy had treated the laity as second-class citizens. Luther proclaimed the priesthood of believers. All Christians are holy. All are priests, he taught. As a result, Protestant teachers diligently instructed the laity, translated the Bible into various European languages and spread literacy so everyone could read Scripture. Bible knowledge exploded.

Another problem: Catholics rarely took the Lord’s Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist. When they did, they got only bread. To the Reformers, all baptized Christians should receive both bread and wine, God’s gift to the whole church.

The cultural and political effects of the Reformation were huge. Our world was made, for good and ill, by the Reformation.

We don't even know that we live among ruins.

Without Protestant teaching, there’d be no Charles Dickens (“Great Expectations”), John Milton (“Paradise Lost”) or C.S. Lewis (“The Chronicles of Narnia”). The Reformation also contributed to the formation of the nation-state and global politics.

Despite their achievements, the Reformers failed. The gospel took hold in some pockets, but it didn’t reform the whole church or re-Christianize Europe.

The Reformation failed because it fragmented the Western church. Protestants were forced out of the Catholic Church, and soon Protestants began squabbling among themselves.

Before Luther, the Western church wasn’t perfectly calm. But, as Reformation historian Lee Palmer Wandel has shown, the Reformation produced deeper and more lasting divisions.

In 1500, a “Christian” was a baptized Catholic. By 1600, there were competing definitions of “Christian.” Protestants didn’t view Catholics as “Christians,” and vice versa.

By 1600, European Christians didn’t worship together. Catholics didn’t welcome Protestants to the Mass, and Protestants didn’t share the Lord’s Supper with other Protestants.

Divisions split families. Protestants found Catholic weddings repulsive. To Catholics, non-sacramental Protestant marriages were adulterous and Protestant children were – in effect -- bastards.

In some cases, divisions resulted in violence. During the sixteenth century, Christian rulers killed about 5,000 Christians. Survivors fled or were expelled. By 1600, every sort of Christian was persecuted somewhere in Europe.

The Reformers didn’t set out to split the church. The Reformation began as a retrieval, not a rejection, of catholicity and unity. They wanted to reform the whole Western church.

The Reformers denied that the word “catholic,” which means “universal,” was equivalent to “Roman.” The church is catholic because, in all times and places, there is only one church.

Children in Geneva, Switzerland, where Reformation leader John Calvin lived, were taught to believe in one Catholic Church. Calvin’s Catechism said, “As there is but one Head of the faithful so they ought all to be united in one body.”

Catholics charged that Protestants were schismatics, but Calvin turned the accusation around: “Wolves complain against the lambs.” By demanding submission to Rome, Catholics themselves violated catholicity.

For the Reformers, the Catholic Church wasn’t too visible or united. Rome was so swaddled in the trappings of power that the church’s catholic essence, the communion of saints, was barely visible at all.

Why did things go wrong? How did the Catholic Reformation fracture the church?

Martin Bucer, the Reformer of Strasbourg, Germany, said it best: “Both sides have failed. Some of us have overemphasized unimportant points, and others have not adequately reformed obvious abuses.”

A half millennium on, the church remains broken. We don’t kill each other, but we don’t worship together either. There are still competing definitions of “Christian.”

Protestants and Catholics both confess the same core doctrines of the Trinity and the deity of Christ, but at many points our beliefs diverge sharply.

The worst of it is that we’ve become complacent. We act as if a divided church is normal, even healthy. We’re “house blind” and don’t even know that we live among ruins.

Protestantism has a future only if we Protestants recover the original catholic vision of the Reformers. We need to take up the project of uniting and renewing the whole church.

Some Protestants recoil at talk about reuniting Catholics and Protestants in one church (not to mention the Eastern Orthodox Church and others). They see such a project as an abandonment of the Gospel.

And yet it’s exactly the opposite. The imperative to unity is an evangelical imperative, a demand of the Gospel.

Here’s why. The Gospel begins with God’s promise that Abraham’s seed would unite the nations that had been scattered at Babel. All nations would share in God’s blessing (Genesis 12:1-4). Israel’s prophets envisioned a day when nations would stream to Jerusalem to worship the living God. They would learn the Lord’s ways, and turn their firearms into farm tools.

Jesus fulfills the promise to Abraham and the hopes of the prophets. He broke down the dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles. He died and rose again to form a new, united human race.

The Gospel is good news that God has reconciled the sinful human race to himself through Jesus. It’s also the good news that God has reconciled sinful human beings to one another.

The church is called to be God’s new humanity. Drawing from every tribe, tongue and nation, the church is a living sign of the gospel. By definition, a divided church contradicts the gospel. It grieves Jesus, who asked His Father to make us one as the Father is one with the Son (John 17:20-21).

As long as Protestants remain divided from each other, and separated from Catholics, Orthodox and others, our churches fail to experience the fullness of the Gospel.

Yet reunion seems impossible. Will Protestants and Catholics ever agree on the Pope or Mary or the real presence of Christ in the Lord’s Supper or justification by faith?

We can’t reunite the church by ignoring the past or diluting truth. The church will be reunited through a deeper grasp and more faithful practice of the Gospel we preach, truths Christians confess together.

In fact, we can’t reunite the church at all. Only God’s Spirit can overcome the insurmountable obstacles that stand in the way.

The Reformation recovered the Gospel, but undermined that Gospel by the divisions it sowed.

In other words, the Reformation failed. Five hundred years on, the only viable Protestant future – the only evangelical future, the only future faithful to the Reformers’ vision – is a catholic future.","The Reformation, led by Luther, failed.

By David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey, The Wall Street Journal



The Trump presidency has been consumed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s efforts to uncover collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Mr. Mueller reportedly has secured one or more indictments that he will announce Monday. Some Republicans now seek a new special counsel to investigate if the Clinton Campaign “colluded” with Russians to smear Candidate Trump, along with other aspects of the Clintons’ relationship with Russia and Russian nationals. But one special counsel already is one too many.

During the 1980s and ’90s, American politics was repeatedly distorted, and lives devastated, through the appointment of independent counsels under the post-Watergate Ethics in Government Act. These constitutionally anomalous prosecutors were given unlimited time and resources to investigate officials, including President Clinton, and scandals, such as Iran-Contra. Once appointed, almost all independent counsels built little Justice Departments of their own and set out to find something—anything—to prosecute. Hardly anyone lamented the expiration of this pernicious law in 1999.

But special counsels, appointed by the attorney general and in theory subject to Justice Department oversight, haven’t proved any better in practice. Mr. Mueller’s investigation has already morphed into an open-ended inquiry. It is examining issues—like Donald Trump’s private business transactions—that are far removed from the Russian question. It also has expanded its focus beyond the original question of collusion with the Russians to whether anyone involved in the Russia investigation has committed some related offense. That is evident from investigators’ efforts to interview White House aides who were not involved in the 2016 campaign, and from leaks suggesting that Mr. Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey might have “obstructed” justice.","Begging Your Pardon, Mr. President: How Trump Can Shut Down the Special Counsel Probe",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/30/begging-your-pardon-mr-president-how-trump-can-shut-down-special-counsel-probe

That is the first Halloween I remember the hum of petrified parents. It was the first time we didn’t get to go trick or treating, no not even one street over. Instead, we had a makeshift party at a neighbor’s house. The TV news turned on low warned of tainted Tylenol.

The next year was the first time we took our candy to the police station to be X-rayed to check for needles and razor blades. We heard the adults whisper: “What is the world coming to?”

We didn’t know, but I thought as police checked out my candy: “Easy with that full-size Snickers you’re manhandling!”

As an adult with children ranging in age from 3 to 22, I have seen just about everything in the ways of Halloween. From the politically incorrect to the religiously correct to the “yeah, just give us some freaking candy,” everyone has an opinion.

And every year there is some new rule or renegade rant about all the souls that have come and gone, and may or may not stop by for some creepy punch served over dry ice. Dry ice, by the way, is very dangerous when handled with bare hands.

As I watched volunteers wander into the haunted house at my daughter’s school, I noted that 35 years ago those costumes would have sent me to counseling. My husband whimpered and covered the eyes of our 5-year-old as a cheerleader with high-def cosmetics entered, carrying what was supposed to be her own head under one arm.

Everything is more terrifying now, in make-believe and in real life.

In real life, gunmen take people out with high-powered rifles at concerts, and bad guys put poison and needles in caramel apples. But that is the minority. I refuse to believe it is the majority or the rule.

In the infamous words of Linus in Charles Schultz’s “The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown”:

“There are three things I've learned never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin.”

When it comes to Halloween, there are some who will lock themselves away in fear of what might happen, or to nurse their wounds because of what did happen. There are some who lock themselves away in protest.

There are others who call it something else, like a fest or a carnival so as not to offend or beckon souls. Still, others will go too far, making some crude political statement or dressing their toddler like a French maid or Monica Lewinsky.

And in this game called Halloween, all that is necessary for us to have something for us to talk about next year. Some grand opinion, some horrific worry, some hill to die on, or some great offense that rocks us to our core and gets us out of bed to write that letter, so that we might be heard.

I find myself wishing I was sitting in a pumpkin patch with Linus, a sheet over my head, never mind the thread count, two holes cut out for eyes. I make no statement with this sheet. I courageously eat unwrapped Rice Krispies that the neighbor dropped in my bucket. I don’t care how she voted in the last election. I wait patiently for something magical to happen, less publicized and political than Santa.

Country star Alan Jackson, the late guitarist and singer Jerry Reed and songwriter Don Schlitz were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday.

Country icon Loretta Lynn returned to the Hall of Fame for the first time since she suffered a stroke in May to formally induct Jackson. Lynn, who cancelled her tour dates this year to recover, said Jackson was the only person that could make her leave her house.

She recalled meeting Jackson when he was a nervous young artist decades ago and knowing then that he would ""be one of the greatest singers in country music.""

""He hadn't let me down,"" said Lynn, who is also a member of the Hall of Fame.

The 59-year-old Jackson is still one of country music's most successful solo artists, having sold nearly 45 million albums in the United States and had 26 singles reach the top of the Billboard country charts.

With his baritone voice and knack for telling stories about small town Southern life, the Newnan, Georgia-born singer was among a wave of neo-traditionalists that broke through in the 1990s.

He joked that when he was signed to Arista Nashville, a label started by Clive Davis, they had no idea how popular he would become.

""I was just a token country singer they signed for that label and bam, I took off,"" Jackson said.

Many of his hits became instant classics, from the barroom staple ""Chattahoochee"" to the somber ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"" written after the Sept. 11 attacks.

But he's also been characterized as shy and uneasy in the media spotlight.

""I am not really shy, just socially awkward,"" Jackson said. ""I just don't like to talk too much.""

Instead, he let his songs speak for him, often writing about his father, his wife and the everyday joys and sorrows of the average man. Other hits include ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"" ''A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)"" and ""When Somebody Loves You.""

George Strait, Alison Krauss and Lee Ann Womack each performed one of Jackson's songs in his honor.

Reed, who died at age 71 in 2008, was first known as an in-demand studio musician with a unique finger picking style on the guitar. He played for and wrote songs for stars like Elvis Presley and Porter Wagoner.

Reed, originally from Atlanta, became more popular when his songs began charting. His hit song ""When You're Hot, You're Hot"" earned him a Grammy award.

In later years, he started appearing in TV and movies, most notably playing Burt Reynolds' sidekick in ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He also sang many of the songs on the soundtrack, including ""East Bound and Down.""

His daughters, Seidina Hubbard and Lottie Zavala, accepted the honor on his behalf.

Hubbard said one of her fondest memories of growing up was listening ""to the beautiful sound of that guitar in the house all the time.""

Performing some of his songs were guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, John Knowles and Steve Wariner, while Jamey Johnson performed one of his personal favorites, ""East Bound and Down.""

Schlitz, 65, from Durham, North Carolina, had his first songwriting hit in 1978 when Kenny Rogers recorded his song, ""The Gambler,"" which became Rogers' signature song throughout his career.

Other songs he helped write include ""On the Other Hand"" and ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" both sung by Randy Travis; ""When You Say Nothing at All,"" recorded by both Keith Whitley and Alison Krauss; and ""Strong Enough to Bend,"" by Tanya Tucker.

He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 and helped to create the popular songwriters in the round format at Nashville's famed Bluebird Café.

Aloe Blacc and Vince Gill sang a duet version of ""The Gambler,"" while singers Charlie Worsham and Mary Chapin Carpenter also performed his songs in his honor.

Schlitz gave some advice to his grandchildren seated in the audience from what he had learned in his career.

""No one does this alone. In your life, be a part of something bigger than yourself,"" Schlitz said.",Loretta Lynn returns after stroke to honor Alan Jackson,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/loretta-lynn-returns-after-stroke-to-honor-alan-jackson.html

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ.
Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.","“The older my kids get, the more I realize how little control I have over them. My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

God can be trusted with the kids he has entrusted to us.",God’s given us our children. Let’s trust Him and let go of our anxiety,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/god-s-given-us-our-children-let-s-trust-him-and-let-go-our-anxiety.html

TRUMP UNSTEADY WITH BASE AS MUELLER STORM SETS IN

The defining chapter of President Trump’s term began today. Is he ready?

We do not mean his legal strategies or even his communications effort in confronting the specific charges against Trump’s former campaign staffers from Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Instead, the real concern for Trump is whether he has enough political support to weather what promises to be a punishing ordeal for him and his administration.

The hope among Republicans had been that they would be farther along in their agenda before this inevitable moment arrived. Trump and his party imagined that policy victories would provide a shock-absorbing cushion of popularity support for the president before Mueller inserted the scalpel.

That’s understandable thinking, especially for people who are deeply committed to their agenda. When all you have are tax cuts and ObamaCare repeal, everything looks like a nail.

But the agenda is gaining traction, so why do a spate of recent polls show Trump at his lowest-ever ratings as president?

Consider the most recent Fox News poll which finds Trump down 12 points in a month among one of his core constituencies: white, male voters without college degrees.

The president is doing about as well or better than he ever has among self-identified Republicans, carding 83 percent support among GOPers, not far from where he was a year ago when he won the presidency.

And there’s much for them to be happy about.

Talk of tax cuts is everywhere, the administration is jackhammering ObamaCare into oblivion, Trump is a more ferocious culture warrior than ever and, with new internal controls, the White House has taken a turn for the normal.

But it wasn’t Republicans who made the difference for Trump. In fact, he did worse with members of his own party than other recent nominees.

Those aforementioned working-class white voters, especially independents, were the ones who took Trump over the top in the Upper Midwest. Among independent voters, Trump is 16 points off of his Election Day 2016 pace.

We would suggest that Trump’s recent swoon is exactly for the same reasons that had Republicans feeling quite chipper prior to today. Why would economically insecure voters be happy to hear about Trump cutting off payments to middle-class ObamaCare beneficiaries while simultaneously evangelizing for a huge corporate tax cut?

The poll bears it out. Working-class white voters and independents both gave Trump low marks for his handling of taxes (42 percent and 34 percent, respectively) and health care (35 percent and 29 percent).

Trump and his fellow Republicans have been in a mud-wrestling match since even before he took office, but despite some harsh words in recent weeks, Trump and the Republican establishment have settled into something like a working relationship on taxes and ObamaCare.

While Trump certainly has to rely on Republicans in Congress and in his cabinet to protect him as Mueller continues his incisions, the grudging support of the leaders of an unpopular political party is not enough. That’s especially true if the price of their assent means that Trump will continue to bleed support among those blue-collar workers who delivered his upset victory.

Many Republicans will stand by Trump through this battle as long as they believe it will advance their partisans interests and no further. What Trump really needs is to still be seen as the champion of those forgotten voters with whom he connected last year.

Slashing business taxes and cutting welfare benefits seems like an unlikely way to win back voters drawn to Trump’s promise of economic nationalism and nation building here at home.

Key takeaways from new Russia charges - Lawfare: “The first big takeaway from this morning’s flurry of charging and plea documents with respect to Paul Manafort Jr., Richard Gates III, and George Papadopoulos is this: The President of the United States had as his campaign chairman a man who had allegedly served for years as an unregistered foreign agent for a puppet government of Vladimir Putin, a man who was allegedly laundering remarkable sums of money even while running the now-president’s campaign, a man who allegedly lied about all of this to the FBI and the Justice Department. The second big takeaway is even starker: A member of President Trump’s campaign team now admits that he was working with people he knew to be tied to the Russian government to ‘arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government officials’ and to obtain ‘dirt’ on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of hacked emails—and that he lied about these activities to the FBI. He briefed President Trump on at least some them.”

Papadopoulos fell for claim that Russian was Putin’s niece - Daily Beast: “Days after becoming a foreign policy advisor for the Trump campaign in 2016, George Papadopoulos started meeting with a woman he believed to be Vladimir ‘Putin’s niece,’ according to a newly unsealed indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller. … Maybe, the woman said, she could even get the two men to meet face-to- face. … Bu t the woman was not, in fact, Putin’s relative. Papadopoulos had, in a sense, been catfished—and then lied about catfishing to federal investigators.”

Targeting Manafort sign of ‘divide and conquer’ strategy - Vox: “[Sean Illing] recently reached out to Renato Mariotti, who served as a federal prosecutor from 2007 to 2016 and who is now a candidate for Illinois Attorney General, and asked him what we can infer from Mueller’s aggressive approach to this case. He told me that Mueller is employing what he calls a ‘divide and conquer’ strategy, meaning he’s looking to exploit conflicts between people under investigation in order to turn them against one another. That Mueller’s team is homing in on Manafort, he adds, suggest two things: that they have the strongest case against him and that they believe he has incriminating information about other people under investigation.”

What did Manafort spend all that money on? - Weekly Standard: “The indictment of Paul Manafort and Richard Gates is filled with interesting tidbits about their businesses and lifestyles. … What did Manafort spend his money on? ‘Vendor B’ is a ‘Home Automation, Lighting and Home Entertainment Company in Florida.’ Manafort wired them $1,319,218 over the course of two years. ‘Vendor C’ is an ‘Antique Rug Store in Alexandria, Virginia.’ Manafort wired them eight payments totally $934,350 over the course of two years. (And then wired another $100,000 to a ‘Vendor D’ who was ‘related to Vendor C.’”

Trump camp fundraises off of indictment - USA Today: “Less than two hours after President Trump’s former campaign manager was indicted Monday, the Trump re-election campaign decided to send out a fundraising email. The email, entitled ‘Still Standing’ and from presidential son Eric Trump, describes the ‘opposition’ to the administration. ‘The mainstream media continues to play politics, creating division and turning the American people against one another,’ the email reads. ‘But as a loyal supporter of our movement, I know you know the truth.’ The email asks for supporters to contribute $1 before the end of the month.”

Top Clinton lobbyist Tony Podesta leaves firm because of Mueller probe - Politico: “Democratic power lobbyist Tony Podesta, founder of the Podesta Group, is stepping down from the lobbying shop that bears his name after coming under investigation by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller. Podesta announced his decision during a firm-wide meeting Monday morning and is alerting clients of his impending departure. Podesta is handing over full operational and financial control to longtime firm CEO Kimberley Fritts, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the meeting. Fritts and a senior group of the Podesta team will be launching a new firm in the next one or two days.”

Republicans want more answers about Trump dossier - Fox News: “Congressional Republicans on Sunday called for Democrats John Podesta and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to provide further answers about their party paying for a dossier on President Trump’s alleged ties to Russia, after telling Senate investigators last month that they had no knowledge of such payments. … South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, suggested on ‘Fox News Sunday’ that the DNC paying a law firm for so-called opposition research connected to the dossier was tantamount to money laundering.”

Pelosi presses for yet another Hill inquiry - AP: “The top Democrat in the House is pressing for an ‘outside, fully independent investigation’ to expose Russia’s meddling in the election and the involvement of Trump officials. That’s the word from Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. In a statement Monday shortly after indictments were unsealed against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an associated, Pelosi said that even with the accelerating special counsel probe and congressional investigations, another inquiry was warranted. Pelosi said that defending the integrity of the country’s democracy ‘demands that Congress look forward to counter Russian aggression and prevent future meddling with our elections.’”

Facebook on the spot to explain Russia narrative - Politico: “Facebook, Twitter and Google are preparing for hearings this week at which lawmakers are expected to grill the companies about the broad reach that foreign actors achieved through fake accounts and deliberate misinformation, a topic that encompasses far more than the 3,000 paid political ads that Facebook disclosed last month.”

French: Not the beginning of the end, the end of the beginning - National Review: “This is not the beginning of the end of the Trump/Russia investigation; it’s the end of the beginning. It’s also a reminder that after countless news reports, an indictment, and a guilty plea we are still like the proverbial blind men feeling the elephant. But when you combine the Papadopoulos indictment with previous reports of the 2016 meeting between purported Russian government representatives and Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner, then it appears clear that Russians seemed determined to at least lead Trump-campaign officials to believe that they had negative information on Clinton.”

TIME OUT: AN EXCLUSIVE GATED COMMUNITY

Smithsonian: “With the help of Google Earth, researchers examining the deserts of Saudi Arabia have found around 400 unreported stone structures in the Arabian Desert, likely built by nomadic tribes thousands of years ago. As Owen Jarus at Live Science reports, the structures are called ‘gates’ since, from an aerial view at least, they share a likeness with field gates. Most of them were found in clusters in Harrat Khaybar, a region in west-central Saudia Arabia known for its now-extinct volcanic domes. … Jarus reports that the gates appear to be the oldest stone structures on the landscape, and may date as far back as 7,000 years. …It’s possible that in the past the area wasn’t quite as inhospitable as it is today. In fact, in recent years researchers have found evidence for ‘Green Arabia’ a theory that the area has swung between wet and dry periods for over a million years.”

LET’S MAKE A DEAL: HOUSE GOP UP FOR ANYTHING ON TAXES

Politico: “House Republicans are so desperate for a win on taxes that they’re agreeing to proposals that would have caused internal party warfare just a year or two ago. They’re considering forgoing a big cut in the top income tax rate on the rich, offering moderate-income Americans so many tax breaks that many would be excused from paying taxes entirely and passing a potentially 1,000-page tax bill few have seen within a matter of weeks. Last week, they agreed to a budget that ignored their demands for deep cuts in federal spending just so they could pass a tax bill using a special procedure that enables them to move forward without any Democratic votes. It’s an open question whether Republicans will be as flexible when party leaders release their entire tax bill, due Nov. 1, and everyone can see exactly who will be the losers under their plan. They already have some internal battles, with Republicans from high-tax states fighting a proposal to dump a long-standing deduction for state and local taxes.”

And it’s all in the details - WashEx: “The details of the Republican tax reform bill will be revealed this week in Congress, but GOP lawmakers are already threatening to sink it over proposed tax loophole closures. Republicans are eager to pass a bill that lowers both individual and business tax rates. But Republicans are up in arms over the proposals to at least partly pay for cuts by eliminating some deductions. House Way and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady has held frequent meetings with a group of lawmakers from high-tax states who oppose a provision that would strike the popular state and local tax deduction. Other lawmakers are threatening to defect if Republicans go anywhere near the 401(k) tax deduction that allows individuals to save up to $18,500 annually tax free.”

Proposed end to homeowner tax credit prompts uproar - WaPo: “The National Association of Home Builders know how to demolish things, and on Saturday they decided to take on a new project — the House Republican tax bill. That’s because one day before, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) informed NAHB that he would not be including a homeownership tax credit as part of the new tax legislation, which will be released on Wednesday. NAHB’s chief executive, Jerry Howard, had spent months working on this new tax provision with Brady’s aides, but House leaders wouldn’t allow its inclusion, Howard was told. The next day, Howard and other NAHB officials gathered on a conference call and debated what to do. They agreed unanimously — kill the bill.”

GILLESPIE A NO SHOW AT TRUMP GROUP’S RALLY

WaPo: “One of President Trump’s most fervent fans hopped onto his Harley in South Carolina and roared all the way to Virginia Beach, where he led a ‘Bikers for Trump’ rally Sunday for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie. Except Gillespie wasn’t there, irking some Trump supporters who say the Republican has been too standoffish toward the president. But Corey Stewart, a Trump acolyte who nearly beat Gillespie in the June gubernatorial primary, was front and center and gave the crowd the blunt, populist rhetoric it craved. ‘We are in a war, a cultural battle,’ boomed Stewart, who is running for the GOP nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine (D) in 2018. ‘And we have to stand up and fight, fight the criminals, communists, crackheads and the weirdos — those are your Democrats.’ He urged the crowd to ‘take back Virginia!’”

Latino Dems equate Gillespie support with racism - Federalist: “A new ad depicts supporters for Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie as racist murderers who hunt schoolchildren from a pickup truck. The ad starts out with two children walking home from school. … All four children run through an alley and get to a chain-link fence. They’re cornered with nowhere else to run. They look back at the truck terrified as the headlights illuminate their faces. The little boy suddenly jerks awake — it’s all a dream. ‘Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American dream?’ a narrator asks while two parents watch news coverage of white nationalists carrying tiki-torches and marching in opposition to the removal of Confederate monuments in Charlottesville, Virginia. The video was paid for by Latino Victory Project, a leftist political action committee, which encouraged its Twitter followers to vote for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam in a tweet.”

What next week’s elections can tell us about 2018 - WashEx: “Elections in Virginia and New Jersey don’t always foreshadow the midterm results. But you can find examples in which they have, dating back to at least 1993. That year, Virginia’s George Allen and New Jersey’s Christine Todd Whitman ran as tough-on-crime tax cutters who supported welfare reform and won. A year later, Republicans took control of both houses of Congress, including their first House majority in 40 years. This year, Virginia has more of a potential to be a bellwether than New Jersey. It has become a battleground state at the presidential level, and control of the governorship has swung back and forth between the parties. And Virginia is the more competitive of the two contests this year.”

Bannon threatens to attack GOP donor Paul Singer - Axios: “In a Friday night phone call, President Trump’s former chief strategist and enforcer Steve Bannon told Trump he was going ‘off the chain’ to destroy Paul Singer, a New York hedge fund billionaire who is one of the most influential donors to the Republican Party. Trump agreed with Bannon that it needed to be done, according to two sources familiar with the conversation. … A source familiar with the arrangements told me that Singer has already made a ‘major commitment’ and cut substantial checks to outside groups to support the president’s tax reform push.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Why do you think that term limits would enable more straight talk by politicians? Many of those limited candidates would depend on being hired by think tanks and your ‘straight talk’ might lessen their chances for hire. A political career does not end when out of office.” – Richard Pohle, Kula, Hawaii

[Ed. note: I certainly take your point, Mr. Pohle. But I also wonder how that would be different than the current situation in which some politicians spend lengthy careers catering to particular interests in hopes of securing sinecures. There is no system for the election of representatives and senators that can protect completely against human nature. The question we wrestle with when talking about term limits is whether such a system would strengthen a pitifully weak legislative branch after a century of executive branch expansion. The best argument for term limits in that sense is that lawmakers would be in a bigger hurry to get things done if they knew that the clock was running and more willing to take risks when they faced lame-duck status.]



“How could any rational person (who is not clearly self-serving, and/or not seeking re-election) speak in terms of the need to relieve middle-class tax burdens, or to greater tax the wealthy? There is the old political adage that ever homeowner thinks NIMBY (‘not in my backyard’) as to any projects that would otherwise serve the greater good. I am concerned that the adage NIMP (‘not in my pocket’) applies even stronger as to how taxpayers feel about the source of most federal government funds. With this as a backdrop, a Republican-led Congress should spend far more time talking about entitlement reform than tax reform, which is just a matter of picking winners and losers to assist in one’s own re-election.” – Ken Levine, Lionville, Pa.



[Ed. note: One of the dividing lines in Washington is on the question of whether people think the government spends too much or taxes too little. Both sides are nominally interested in deficits, but mostly as a tool to advance their preferred vision of government. Unfortunately for those who share your point of view, the constituency for more generous benefits is just as potent, if not more so, than the one for lower taxes. We didn’t get to be $20 trillion in the hole by accident.]

THE DANGERS OF GOING FOR THE LAST ROLLO

AP: “A deer that got its head trapped in an orange plastic pumpkin bucket is free after residents in suburban Cincinnati spent the weekend tracking it. WCPO-TV reports the Anderson Township Family Pet Center got calls over four days from residents concerned about the deer with the bucket stuck over its nose. Daryl Meyerrenke at the pet center warned that it would be dangerous for neighbors to try to rescue the deer, but he says they were determined to help the animal and spent hours following it through wooded areas. Eventually, the group using animal catch poles was able to encircle the deer, and Meyerrenke’s son freed it from the bucket. Meyerrenke says the animal immediately went to graze and drink water at a creek.”

Kennedy only add to the saga of conspiracies over the past 54 years.

It is clear that the reason for this withholding is that these files must involve Russia and to this day, we do not know is the role that Soviet Russia played in President Kennedy’s assassination.

We know that less than two months before the president’s assassination, Oswald travelled to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Oswald claimed that his trip to Mexico was simply to process a routine visa application, but significant questions about this visit remain.

Why would Oswald go the great length of entering a foreign country to process his visa application when he could have more easily applied for a visa at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.

Further, we know that Oswald was a politically active man, heavily engaged with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and would certainly not pass up an opportunity to discuss his involvement, or even his plot to kill the US President, when meeting with Soviet Russians.

It is intriguing that the newly released government files indicate that Oswald met with a senior KGB agent named Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov, who has been previously identified as a member of the KGB’s 13th department, which was responsible for plotting and carrying out assassinations around the world.

Given this compelling evidence, it is clear that the American public must once and for all learn what role the Russians played in the Kennedy assassination, whether it be direct or indirect

This question is of the utmost importance, but is also the reason why the JFK file release is so sensitive.

Today, not only the American media, but the United States Congress is investigating whether Russians became actively engaged with a US Presidential campaign organization. Complicating matters further, there is now clear evidence of issues stemming from Russia with the State Department under Hillary Clinton, the Clinton campaign, and the DNC.

For these reasons, the question we need answered is if this question if Russian interference in American society and into our lives reached an apogee with President Kennedy or if their involvement continues today.

We have known for decades that the security situation in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963 was bungled between different law enforcement agencies from the beginning.

However, the most critical question today is whether Oswald was a lone-actor all along or if a nation that continues to be one of our greatest foreign adversaries was involved in the assassination of the U.S. president.",JFK files release -- The dangerous threat behind the documents we still can't see,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/30/jfk-files-release-dangerous-threat-behind-documents-still-cant-see.html

The original video, which has since been taken down, showed off new features of the iPhone X, including using Apple Pay, shots from inside Apple's cafeteria and even shots of Bauer, who handed the phone to Peterson in the video.

On his LinkedIn page, Bauer, who previously worked at Broadcom before coming to Apple in August 2013, was a self-described ""RF guy"" at Apple. It's unclear what he meant by this, but it could be a reference to radio frequency, the technology that allows phones to communicate with cell sites. Or it's possible he may have worked on radio frequency identification (RFID), a technology used to allow for the purchase of goods, such as a cup of coffee or a subway ticket, using your iPhone.

Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple showed off the iPhone X, along with the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and other new products, at a media event in September. However, those in attendance were only able to play with the new devices for a little while. Peterson, on the other hand, showcased the new device for an extended period of time and received unprecedented access from her father.

APPLE ISSUES RESPONSE TO SENATE IQUIRY ON FACE ID PRIVACY CONCERNS

Apple is famous for its secrecy.

Apple's iPhone X became available for pre-order this past Friday and due to exceptional demand, shipping dates have been pushed back to 5 to 6 weeks for both the 64GB and 256GB models.

In a note to investors, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said Apple ""is taking the iPhone franchise to a whole new level with the iPhone X, pushing the company deep into the ultra-luxury smartphone market with the highest priced iPhone in the company’s history.""

Apple did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News.

Alexandra Leigh Carter, of Toowoomba, Queensland, says she purchased the makeup kit at the Australian supermarket chain Woolworths — and even tested it out on her son’s wrist for 20 minutes — before applying the product to his face during a “trial run” ahead of Halloween.

“This was only on him for 3 minutes and then had to immediately take him for a shower,” she wrote alongside photos of her little boy with redness and irritation on his face. “It has severely burnt his skin.”

Carter says she shared the post to warn other parents to thoroughly test the makeup products their kids plan to use on Halloween. But she also called for the product to be discontinued, and called it “rubbish.”

“I've had his face painted countless time [sic], though whatever is in your product is horrific,” she wrote.

In the comments, Carter further explained that the ordeal “absolutely scared the hell out of both of us,” leading her son to ask if his would be scarred forever. Thankfully, she confirmed the redness died down, and that there doesn't appear to be any lasting marks on his face.

“Not even the most conscious of mums can avoid something like this from happening when you purchase products intended for children,” she said, adding that she didn’t make an “informed choice” when purchasing the cheap product. “I made a mistake unfortunately and THANKFULLY never put it on my youngest son as he does have adverse reactions.”

Carter claims she was offered a $25 gift card as compensation for the incident. She also wrote that Woolworths has been “nothing but helpful and apologetic,” though she is still waiting to hear the results of their investigation into the makeup product.

In the meantime, she says, she’ll be comparing the product’s ingredients to others on the market.

With all the problems in the world, some folks are focusing on whether it’s OK for girls who are not Polynesian to dress up as Moana – the beloved Disney character in an animated film of the same name who is the daughter a Polynesian chief.

The great debate was sparked by Sachi Feris, a mother who wrote on the blog Raising Race Conscious Children that she would refuse to dress her white daughter as Moana for Halloween for fear of “cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty.”

The New York Post, People, Redbook and other websites quickly wrote about this burning issue of our times. In calling on parents to use Halloween as an opportunity “to teach your kids about the importance of cultural sensitivity” the Redbook article (also published in Cosmopolitan) admonished moms and dads: “If your kid wears a racist costume … you’re kind of wearing it too.”

Taking advantage of the collective guilt felt about our nation’s past sins, many white liberals respond with an oversensitivity to any potential act of racism today. That’s why they go around tilting at windmills, claiming to be the “good guys” on the side of justice.

The message of political correctness gone wild is clear: the Moana costume is racist and you are a bad parent if you allow your child to wear it.

And Halloween outrage and hyperventilation isn’t just for kids. It’s open for all ages. Adult-toddlers in American universities might be equally offended this season as well. So, our nation’s institutions of higher learning are taking necessary precautions.

Tufts University encouraged its students to report any “inappropriate and offensive costume” to the police. Violators could be subject to an investigation by campus police and potentially face “serious disciplinary sanctions.”

Tufts campus police will surely welcome the opportunity to crack down on the costume crime wave, including “costumes that appropriate cultures and reproduce stereotypes on race, gender, sexuality, immigrant or socioeconomic status” or relate to “tragedy, controversy or acts of violence.” That sweeping definition is broad enough to cover just about any costume – maybe even some everyday clothing.

The University of Texas issued a 29-point checklist about offensive Halloween costumes.

And Princeton University’s Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding held a “dialogue” about “why culture is not a costume.”

What’s next? Perhaps mandatory DNA testing to determine who is allowed to wear what on Halloween?

Extreme as campus political correctness sounds – and as ridiculous as the Moana outrage is –both make sense when placed in the context of white-guilt politics.

Acclaimed race relations scholar Shelby Steele defines white guilt as “the vacuum of moral authority that comes from simply knowing that one’s race is associated with racism.” Thus, for many Americans, “their white guilt wants no obligation to minority development. It needs only the display of social justice to win moral authority.”

Taking advantage of the collective guilt felt about our nation’s past sins, many white liberals respond with an oversensitivity to any potential act of racism today. That’s why they go around tilting at windmills, claiming to be the “good guys” on the side of justice. Any manufactured cause, from Disney costumes to campus “safe spaces,” is an opportunity for them to win moral authority.

Here’s the problem:

First, these left-wing “activists” only need the appearance of social justice to meet their objective. The results of their work don’t matter. It doesn’t matter that their identity politics has led to more division in our country. They don’t care about the long-term effects of bad government policies on underprivileged communities, so long as politicians can say they developed a new program.

It doesn’t matter how minority students perform in their universities, so long as the photo-ops make their campuses look diverse. They’ve completely embraced the idea of perception as reality, so actual reality is immaterial to them.

Secondly, a nation mired in guilt from its past can’t unite in the future. While it’s important that we learn from the lessons of history, we must acknowledge that we can’t atone for them.

As famed economist and philosopher Thomas Sowell wrote: “Galling as it may be to be helpless to redress the crying injustices of the past, symbolic expiation in the present can only create new injustices among the living.” If we see everything through prism of our racist past, we can’t work together for a better tomorrow.

And by the way, in case any readers think Shelby Steele, Thomas Sowell and I are a bunch of insensitive white racists, please be advised that all of us are black.

Hysteria over petty issues like Halloween costumes will continue as long as the politics of white guilt pervades American culture. While good-hearted families celebrate with their loved ones on Tuesday, any costume that can be misconstrued as insensitive racially, culturally or in some other way will be attacked on social media by people who make a living off dividing our nation.

Instead of trying to pit us against each other while raising the banner of “social justice,” concerned citizens should not waste time determining the political correctness of children’s costumes. Together, Americans of good will from every background imaginable should focus on what unites us and build a better future for us all and for our children.",Halloween: Progressive pitchforks are out to destroy what ought to be a fun holiday,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/halloween-progressive-pitchforks-are-out-to-destroy-what-ought-to-be-fun-holiday.html
