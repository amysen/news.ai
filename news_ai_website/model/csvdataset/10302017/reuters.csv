Indus Towers, the biggest Indian mast operator with nearly 123,000 towers, is owned 42 percent each by Bharti Infratel and Vodafone’s Indian unit. Third-ranked mobile carrier Idea Cellular along with its associate owns the remainder.

Vodafone India and Idea, which are combining their operations to create the biggest Indian phone carrier, have said they will look at selling their stake in Indus, and also dispose of other tower assets they own to help cut debt in the merged company.

In a stock exchange filing on Monday, Bharti Infratel said its board had decided to “explore and evaluate (the) acquisition of (a) stake in one or more tranches in Indus Towers Ltd with the aim of making it a subsidiary or wholly-owned subsidiary” of the company.

It did not give further details.

Private equity firm KKR & Co LP and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) in March agreed to buy just over a 10 percent stake in Bharti Infratel, which is majority owned by biggest Indian telecoms carrier Bharti Airtel.

The Economic Times newspaper reported this month that a consortium led by KKR was eyeing both Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel, and that as a first step of that deal Bharti Infratel would buy all or most of the other partners’ holdings in Indus.

The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party made progress in talks on Monday and they will continue talking on Tuesday, the British government’s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said.

“In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to Parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed,” Brokenshire said in a statement.

“The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night,” he said, adding that the British government would consider “certain additional requests” made by the parties.

Brokenshire had earlier indicated that if there was no deal by the end of Monday it would move to pass an annual budget for the region to ensure essential services are funded.

A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, which observers have warned could destabilize a delicate political balance in the region.

The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province.

But Sinn Fein in January pulled out complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.

Talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP have stalled in recent weeks, in large part over proposals to improve the rights of Irish language speakers.

Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said the government could only be reformed “on the basis of equality, rights and respect”, which would require concessions from the DUP.

While the DUP also said it wanted to see the executive re-established, ahead of the talks it called for London to bring forward the budget “to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland”.

Neither party spoke to assembled media on the state of the talks on Monday evening.

FILE PHOTO: Maulana Masood Azhar, head of Pakistan's militant Jaish-e-Mohammad party, attends a pro-Taliban conference organised by the Afghan Defence Council in Islamabad August 26, 2001.

India, backed by the United States, has been trying to get Maulana Masood Azhar on a U.N. list of groups with ties to Al Qaeda, blaming his group for a series of attacks in India, including one on its parliament in 2002 and another last year on an airbase.

But China, a member of the U.N. Security Council, has repeatedly put a technical hold on the Indian request, the latest of which is due to end this week.

Such decisions must be based on cast-iron evidence and fully backed by members of the U.N. panel charged with implementing resolutions relating to sanctions on militant groups and individuals, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

“China proposed a technical hold, the aim of which was to give more time for the committee members to discuss it and for relevant parties to have further consultations,” Hua told a daily news briefing.

“But regrettably, the committee has yet to reach consensus.”

The wrangling over Masood Azhar, a longtime Indian foe, has become a thorny issue in ties between China and India, which fears Beijing is disregarding its concerns over terrorism.

It has also fueled worries that China will stick to its “all-weather” friend, India’s arch-foe Pakistan, no matter the weight of evidence against Islamabad.

Pakistan denies giving material support to militants fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir besides carrying out attacks elsewhere.

It said it interrogated Azhar and his associates in the Jaish-e-Mohammad group after the January 2016 attack on the Pathankot air base but found no evidence linking him to it.

Hua said there were clear rules for listing a person or group as a terrorist, and that China has always believed the relevant U.N. committee should operate on the principles of objectivity, fairness and professionalism on this matter.

O presidente catalão deposto, Carles Puigdemont, viajou à Bélgica com vários outros membros de seu gabinete demitido, segundo um integrante de alto escalão do governista Partido Popular. O procurador-geral espanhol, José Manuel Maza, pediu que os líderes catalães sejam acusados de rebelião, insubordinação e malversação de recursos públicos, além de fraude e mau uso de fundos.

A Catalunha, uma região próspera com língua e cultura próprias, desencadeou a pior crise do país em décadas ao realizar um referendo de independência no dia 1º de outubro que os tribunais espanhóis consideraram ilegal.

O primeiro-ministro espanhol, Mariano Rajoy, assumiu o controle direto da região na sexta-feira, demitiu seu governo secessionista e convocou uma eleição antecipada para 21 de dezembro.

A calma vista nas ruas de Barcelona nesta segunda-feira foi a resposta a um final de semana de incerteza, durante o qual não estava claro como a região reagiria ao controle central.

Alguns dos líderes catalães mais proeminentes, inclusive Puigdemont e seu vice-presidente, Oriol Junqueras, disseram que não aceitarão suas demissões –mas seus respectivos partidos, PdeCat e Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, disseram nesta segunda-feira que participarão da eleição, uma aceitação tácita de que o Parlamento foi desfeito.

Segundo a rede de televisão La Sexta, Puigdemont pode pedir asilo na Bélgica junto com cinco outros membros de seu governo que foram demitidos.

A legislatura regional cancelou uma reunião de terça-feira, outro sinal de que os parlamentares aceitaram sua demissão.

Um pedido de desobediência civil generalizada feito pelos principais grupos civis por trás da campanha secessionista não atraiu muitos seguidores. A maioria dos servidores públicos, como professores, bombeiros e policiais, retomou o trabalho normalmente nesta segunda-feira, e não havia sinais de absenteísmo generalizado.

Puigdemont publicou uma foto tirada na sede do governo regional no Instagram, mas não foi visto entrando no edifício, o que sugere que a foto pode ter sido tirada por outra pessoa.

O diretor regional dos transportes, Josep Rull, postou no Twitter uma foto de si mesmo trabalhando no escritório, mas mais tarde foi visto deixando o prédio.

Duas pesquisas de opinião mostraram que o apoio à independência pode ter começado a declinar. Uma pesquisa da empresa Sigma Dos publicada no jornal El Mundo revelou que 33,5 por cento dos catalães são a favor da separação, e outra da Metroscopia publicada no jornal El País estimou este número em 29 por cento –em julho eram 41,1 por cento, de acordo com uma pesquisa oficial realizada pelo governo catalão.

The chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, Dara Khosrowshahi, arrived in Brazil to lobby against the bill that is due to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday and which threatens the company’s business in a fast-growing foreign market.

Brazil is Uber’s third-largest market, with 17 million users, and the city of Sao Paulo sees more trips on the ride-hailing service than any other city in the world, ahead of New York and Mexico City, according to the company.

A spokesman for the company said the application as it exists could not operate under the new rules, including the use of a taxi license plate on cars owned by Uber drivers.

“The business model we have today would not longer be viable,” Uber’s executive spokesman in Brazil Fabio Sabba told Reuters.

Uber is already battling to keep operating in London after the city’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service and refused to renew its license.

Police said 800 Uber drivers drove through the center of Brazil’s capital Brasilia to protest the bill that many say will put them out of business. Similar protests in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro snarled downtown traffic.

Uber did not organize the drivers’ protests but alerted authorities that they would happen.

“The bill will create so much bureaucracy that it prevents the 500,000 drivers in Brazil from earning income for their families,” Uber said in a statement.

Uber said it has paid 495 million reais ($150 million) in federal and municipal taxes so far this year.

The bill, which has already been approved by the lower house of Congress, would define ride hailing applications as public transport instead of private services and require drivers to get a special permit from city authorities. It would also establish additional regulations and taxes.

If the Senate votes to approve the bill, it will be up to President Michel Temer to sign or veto the legislation or parts of it.

Sunday’s shock 2-1 defeat to Liga newcomers Girona saw them fall eight points behind arch rivals Barcelona in the standings, the biggest gap they have faced with a league leader since their final turbulent campaign under Jose Mourinho in 2012/13.

Madrid were also defending champions in the Portuguese’s final campaign but came unstuck at the start of the season, dropping eight points in their first four games while Barcelona raced ahead, eventually finishing 15 clear of Madrid while Mourinho had an acrimonious split with the dressing room.

The feeling in the Spanish sports press after Zinedine Zidane’s side threw away a 1-0 lead at halftime was one of resignation about Madrid’s faltering campaign, as the 32-times Liga champions have never managed to win the title after falling eight points behind the leaders.

“Madrid vote no to La Liga”, ran a headline on the website of daily newspaper Marca, alluding to the political undertones of Sunday’s game at Girona, Real’s first trip to the troubled region of Catalonia since a banned referendum on independence on Oct. 1 sparked Spain’s worst political crisis in 39 years.

Only Madrid’s goalscorer Isco and forward Karim Benzema were exempt from criticism in Marca, which criticised the team’s usual talisman Cristiano Ronaldo for only scoring once this campaign and called out Marcelo, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and captain Sergio Ramos for unconvincing displays.

“Isco is out on his own”, ran the cover of newspaper AS, while daily ABC described Madrid as “apathetic”, calling the defeat the team’s worst performance since Zidane took over at the club in January 2016 and began a winning cycle that has yielded seven trophies.

The French coach said Real had lost the game due to two lapses of concentration in the space of four minutes which lead to Cristhian Stuani’s equaliser and Portu’s winner, but denied there was a problem with the team’s attitude.

“What I‘m most annoyed about is not killing the game off when we had the chance to do it,” the coach said in a news conference after Girona snapped Real’s record run of 13 consecutive away wins over the course of two seasons.

Initial estimates show GDP expanded at an annualized rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, despite the effect of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. An increase in goods made but not sold helped, but so did global growth and healthy corporate earnings. Protectionist policies could put the trend at risk.

Third-quarter growth was a pleasant surprise after economists projected expansion of 2.5 percent. Growth in consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic output, slowed down to 2.4 percent but is expected to rebound as the effects of the hurricane fade. And rising inventories contributed just over 0.7 percentage points to growth, in what could be a sign that companies think consumer demand will warm up.

There are other positive signs. Business investment, which had been lagging but improved in recent months, came in at a healthy 3.9 percent. Exports increased by 2.3 percent in their third quarter, which added more than 0.4 percentage points to economic growth. It’s aided by global expansion, with world economic growth in sync for the first time in years and Europe catching up with the United States. The International Monetary Fund projected the global economy would get a 3.6 percent boost in 2017 and grow by 3.7 percent the following year.

President Donald Trump has promised to cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent – but whether or not he succeeds, companies are performing well. The Nasdaq reached a record high on Friday morning after tech groups from Amazon (AMZN.O) to Microsoft (MSFT.O) reported robust third quarter earnings. On top of that, the United States is nearly at full employment with a jobless rate of 4.2 percent.

Past form suggests Trump will take credit. True, the nearly 20 percent rise in the S&P 500 since his election is partly due to the hope of tax cuts. But most of the positive economic trends are occurring without major legislative accomplishments. The biggest risk to this outlook is harmful trade policies, including a disintegration of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for which negotiations aren’t going well. The best that can be said is that Trump has not yet done the economy harm.

The chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, Dara Khosrowshahi, arrived in Brazil to lobby against the bill that is due to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday and which threatens the company’s business in a fast-growing foreign market.

Brazil is Uber’s third-largest market, with 17 million users, and the city of Sao Paulo sees more trips on the ride-hailing service than any other city in the world, ahead of New York and Mexico City, according to the company.

A spokesman for the company said the application as it exists could not operate under the new rules, including the use of a taxi license plate on cars owned by Uber drivers.

“The business model we have today would not longer be viable,” Uber’s executive spokesman in Brazil Fabio Sabba told Reuters.

Uber is already battling to keep operating in London after the city’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service and refused to renew its license.

Police said 800 Uber drivers drove through the center of Brazil’s capital Brasilia to protest the bill that many say will put them out of business. Similar protests in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro snarled downtown traffic.

Uber did not organize the drivers’ protests but alerted authorities that they would happen.

“The bill will create so much bureaucracy that it prevents the 500,000 drivers in Brazil from earning income for their families,” Uber said in a statement.

Uber said it has paid 495 million reais ($150 million) in federal and municipal taxes so far this year.

The bill, which has already been approved by the lower house of Congress, would define ride hailing applications as public transport instead of private services and require drivers to get a special permit from city authorities. It would also establish additional regulations and taxes.

If the Senate votes to approve the bill, it will be up to President Michel Temer to sign or veto the legislation or parts of it.

The combined company will be worth more than $20 billion, inclusive of debt, and have integrated power generating assets and retail businesses across six of the largest electricity markets in the United States.

Debt-laden power producers such as Dynegy have seen their margins fall, as cheap natural gas from shale fields drives electricity prices lower, leading a handful of power companies to merge to cut costs and streamline operations.

Earlier this year, utility Sempra Energy (SRE.N) agreed to buy power transmission company Oncor for $9.45 billion, while Vistra’s rival, Calpine Corp (CPN.N), is selling itself to investors led by Energy Capital Partners in a $5.6 billion deal.

Vistra, the largest retailer and generator of electricity in Texas, is based in Irving, while Dynegy is headquartered in Houston but the majority of its power plants are in the northeast United States and Illinois.

“Regional diversification is a big discussion point for Vistra, but it’s also about combining assets, getting economies of scale and being able to extrapolate operating efficiencies,” said analyst Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.

Vistra Chief Executive Officer Curt Morgan told Reuters his firm would sell three gas power plants in Texas, which produce a combined 900 megawatts, to reduce its market share in the ERCOT generating zone which covers most of the state to below 20 percent, allaying any potential competition concerns.

The Public Utility Commission of Texas has cited capitalization and competitive concerns as the main reasons for scuppering attempts by two other buyers to acquire Oncor before Sempra agreed its deal.

“We have a high degree of confidence that the deal will be approved (by regulators),” Morgan said.

Dynegy shareholders will receive 0.652 shares of Vistra for each share of Dynegy they own, translating to a price of $13.24 per share and a 21 percent stake in the new firm.

The combined company, which will have annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about $3 billion, will serve around 2.9 million retail customers and have around 40 gigawatts of generating capacity.

Vistra said it would achieve an estimated $350 million of annual cost savings through areas such as better procurement practices, as well as additional benefits related to tax and improvements to its balance sheet.

Dynegy’s high existing debt level would not be a concern for Vistra shareholders, according to Morgan. Dynegy’s debt-for-equity ratio of 5.41 is more than double the industry median, according to Thomson Reuters data.

“Shareholders will do the calculation around leverage versus the value creation that will be generated and see the benefits of the deal,” he said.

Vistra’s shares were 8.3 percent lower at $18.62, while Dynegy’s stock was 6 percent higher at $11.90 after jumping 11.3 percent earlier in the day.

Amazon, which is winning business from older, big-box rivals, pleased investors with its transparency around Whole Foods, the premium grocer it recently bought.

“The Street went into third quarter earnings concerned about lack of disclosure around Whole Foods, and Amazon surprised to the upside here by breaking out Whole Foods contribution,” analysts at JP Morgan said.

Amazon’s shares, have risen 30 percent this year through Thursday’s close, as its AWS cloud business has stayed ahead of the competition.

Alphabet’s Google, a relatively smaller player in the cloud business, doesn’t break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but analysts estimate the business is growing very fast, complementing the company’s core advertising business.

U.S. crude exports have boomed since the decades-old ban was lifted less than two years ago, with shipments recently hitting a record of 2 million barrels a day. But shippers and traders fear the rising trend is not sustainable, and if limits are hit, it could pressure the price of U.S. oil.

How much crude the United States can export is a mystery. Most terminal operators and companies will not disclose capacity, and federal agencies like the U.S. Energy Department do not track it. Still, oil export infrastructure will probably need further investment in coming years. Bottlenecks would hit not only storage and loading capacity, but also factors such as pipeline connectivity and shipping traffic.

Analysts believe operators will start to run into bottlenecks if exports rise to 3.5 million to 4 million barrels a day. RBC Capital analysts put the figure lower, around 3.2 million bpd.

The United States has not come close to that yet. A total of the highest loading days across Houston, Port Arthur, Corpus Christi and St. James/New Orleans - the primary places where crude can be exported - comes to about 3.2 million bpd, according to Kpler, a cargo tracking service.

But with total U.S. crude production currently at 9.5 million barrels a day and expected to add 800,000 to 1 million bpd annually, export capacity could be tested before long. Over the past four weeks, exports averaged 1.7 million bpd, more than triple a year earlier.

“Right now, there seems to be a little more wiggle room for export levels,” said Michael Cohen, head of energy markets research at Barclays.

“Two to three years down the road, if U.S. production continues to grow like current levels, the market will eventually signal that more infrastructure is needed. But I don’t think a lot of those plans are in place right now.”

If exports do hit a bottleneck, it would put a ceiling on how much oil shippers get out of the country. Growing domestic oil production and limited export avenues could sink U.S. crude prices.

Shippers have booked vessels to go overseas in recent weeks because the premium for global benchmark Brent crude widened to as much as $7 a barrel over U.S. crude, making exports more profitable for domestic producers.

EXPORT PLANS

Exports could hit 4 million bpd by 2022, an Enterprise Products Partners LP executive told an industry event in Singapore recently.

Though some operators are already eyeing expansion plans, there are limitations, said Carlin Conner, chief executive at SemGroup Corp, which owns the Houston Fuel Oil Terminal. SemGroup has three docks for exporting crude and is building additional ones.

“There aren’t very many terminals with the needed pipeline capabilities, tank farm capacity and proper docks to load the ships ... Adding this is expensive and not done easily. So there are limitations to unfettered export access,” he said.

For instance, exports are expected to start from the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) in early 2018 at around one supertanker a month, according to two sources. The LOOP is potentially a key locale for exports. Its location 18 miles (29 km) offshore means it can handle larger vessels than other, shallower ship channels.

While LOOP can load around 40,000 barrels per hour, operating at that capacity is not likely because that same pipe is used to offload imports, the sources added. LOOP did not respond to a request for comment.

In Houston, when looking at the top 30 loading days, crude exports averaged 700,000 bpd, Kpler added. That includes Enterprise’s Houston terminal, among the largest of the export facilities, that had 615,000 bpd.

Other terminal operators are also developing additional facilities. NuStar Energy LP currently can load between 500,000 to 600,000 bpd at its two docks in Corpus Christi, which has about 1 million in capacity, according to a port spokesman. NuStar is developing a third dock, which should come online either late first quarter or early second quarter.

In Houston, Magellan Midstream Partners LP is planning a new 45-foot draft Aframax dock for mid-2018. Aframax vessels can carry about 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of crude.","U.S. oil exports boom, putting infrastructure to the test",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-exports/u-s-oil-exports-boom-putting-infrastructure-to-the-test-idINKBN1CZ29C

The world’s largest online retailer said in a news release that it would start moving into the Culver Studios, where “Gone with the Wind” was filmed, at the end of the year. The space will allow it to expand its headcount beyond the more than 700 employees working in its current Santa Monica, California, office.

Video streaming has been a major reason people subscribe to the Amazon Prime benefits club, whose members tend to buy more from the company.

Amazon Studios chief Roy Price resigned this month, and other top executives left the unit afterward.

Some have criticized Amazon for making shows that do not appeal to a broad-enough audience.

The company is nonetheless committed to original content. Analysts estimate Amazon will have spent $4.5 billion on video in 2017, and the company said last week that it would budget more for next year.

Amazon did not respond to requests for comment on how many people it would hire for the studio. It said in the news release that it would have space to add creative, technical, legal and marketing jobs.

The flood of Rohingya migrants into Bangladesh has grabbed headlines in recent months, but it was the plight of the Rohingya “boat people” two years ago that moved director Edmund Yeo to make the film.

Yeo said the news of mass graves of people thought to be mainly Rohingya victims of human traffickers discovered near Malaysia’s border with Thailand in 2015 drew his attention to conditions for migrants from neighboring countries.

“It inspired me to explore more what really happened,” Yeo told a question-and-answer session after the film’s world premiere in the main competition section at the Tokyo International Film Festival on Saturday.

“I realized that as they tried to run away from their own country, many of them came to Malaysia for a better life, but the truth is, life isn’t better for them,” said Yeo.

“Aqerat” follows Hui Ling, played by Malaysian actress Daphne Low, a young woman painstakingly saving up for a move to Taiwan - until her roommate and the roommate’s abusive boyfriend make off with her savings.

Desperate for money, she begins working for a human smuggling ring, but the job takes a heavy emotional toll as she witnesses severe beatings and death.

Yeo chose the title “Aqerat” after learning it meant “afterlife” in the Rohingya language, similar to the Malay word of the same meaning, “Akhirat”.

“They’re trying to escape from Myanmar, they’re trying to look for an afterlife,” he said. “Is Malaysia their afterlife?”

In July, Sri Lanka signed a long-delayed $1.1 billion deal to lease its southern Hambantota port to China, ignoring an appeal by opposition parties to debate the pact in parliament.

The $1.5-billion port, close to the main shipping route from Asia to Europe and likely to play a key role in China’s “Belt and Road” initiative, has been mired in controversy since a Chinese firm agreed to take an 80 percent stake in it.

The pact signed last year sparked widespread public anger, as Chinese control of the port, which included a plan for a 99-year lease of 15,000 acres (23 sq miles) to develop an adjacent industrial zone, provoked fears it could be used by Chinese naval vessels.

Like business leaders everywhere, including the top brass at JPMorgan, Ping An Chairman Ma Mingzhe wants his group perceived as an inventive tech outfit rather than a lumbering financial supermarket. It’s presenting new metrics to help make the case and touting over 2,000 patent applications. Ping An also is pumping more than $2 billion into technology research this year and a venture-capital fund.

Despite the hype, Ping An is mainly an insurance provider with technology increasingly behind it, not vice versa. Through the first nine months of the year, life, healthcare, property and casualty profit accounted for 71 percent of the total. And though fintech is slowly permeating these divisions, on its own it accounted for just 1 percent. The so-called bancassurance model of systemically significant Ping An, which incorporates lending and asset management, also has been a flop elsewhere.

Political considerations could make a tech valuation difficult, too. Chinese regulators cracked down this year on the likes of Anbang Insurance and Foresea Life for their aggressive growth and use of leverage. Although that probably helped Ping An grab market share, it doesn’t mean it, too, won’t eventually get swept up in the scrutiny.

Facebook gave the details about the reach of Russian posts in written testimony it provided to U.S. lawmakers, which was seen by Reuters.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) separately has found 2,752 accounts linked to Russian operatives, a source familiar with the company’s written testimony said. That estimate is up from a tally of 201 accounts that Twitter reported in September.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google are scheduled to appear before three congressional committees this week on alleged Russian attempts to spread misinformation in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the election, in which President Donald Trump, a Republican, defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, said in the written testimony that the 80,000 posts from Russia’s Internet Research Agency were a tiny fraction of content on Facebook, equal to one out of 23,000 posts.

However, the posts violated Facebook’s terms of service, and any amount of such activity using fake accounts is too much, Stretch wrote.

“These actions run counter to Facebook’s mission of building community and everything we stand for. And we are determined to do everything we can to address this new threat,” he wrote.

The 80,000 posts were published between June 2015 and August 2017. Most of them focused on divisive social and political messages such as race relations and gun rights, Facebook said.

Twitter’s revised estimate of how many Russia-linked accounts were on its service comes a month after an influential Democratic senator, Mark Warner, slammed the company for what he called an insufficient internal investigation.

Twitter has suspended all 2,752 accounts that it tracked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, and it has given U.S. congressional investigators the account names, the source familiar with the company’s written testimony said.

“State-sanctioned manipulation of elections by sophisticated foreign actors is a new challenge for us - and one that we are determined to meet,” Twitter said in written testimony, according to the source.",Facebook says 126 million Americans may have seen Russia-linked political posts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-socialmedia/facebook-says-126-million-americans-may-have-seen-russia-linked-political-posts-idUKKBN1CZ2OI?il=0

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said King, an American, was suffering from “dangerous” heart disease and kidney problems.

“His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,” Mujahid said in a statement.

“We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” he said.

The U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of King and other hostages.

King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital.

Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.

The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.

George Papadopoulos (3rd L) appears in a photograph released on Donald Trump's social media accounts with a headline stating that the scene was of his campaign's national security meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. on March 31, 2016 and published April 1, 2016. Social Media/Handout via REUTERS

George Papadopoulos, who joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016, lied in January about communicating with those individuals to arrange a meeting between then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said in the documents.

The documents said an unidentified campaign official advised Papadopoulos around May 2016 that Trump himself “is not doing these trips” but that “it should be someone low-level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.”

While not mentioned in the documents, top Trump campaign advisers, including Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Campaign Manager Paul Manafort met at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016 with Russians claiming to have derogatory information on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. It was not known whether that meeting resulted from Papadopoulos’ efforts.

The special counsel said Papadopoulos - a Chicago-based international energy lawyer - lied to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about when he learned from an unnamed foreign professor that Russia claimed to have “dirt” in the form of “thousands of emails” on Clinton.

Prosecutors said Papadopoulos told agents he had been in contact with the professor before he joined Trump’s campaign. In fact, they said, Papadopoulos met with the professor after joining the campaign.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Monday played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she told a news briefing. “Any actions that he took would have been on his own.”

Papadopoulos’ lawyers said in a statement it was “in the best interest of our client .... that we refrain from commenting on George’s case.”

The documents were released just after indictments charging Manafort and business associate Rick Gates with multiple offences, including money laundering, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents.

None of the charges against Manafort and Gates, however, directly relate to Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and what U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Russian bid to boost Trump’s candidacy.

The prosecutors said Papadopoulos had been emailing with a “Campaign Supervisor,” “Senior Policy Adviser” and a “High-Ranking Campaign Official.”

An official familiar with congressional investigations into alleged contacts between the campaign and Russia said the Senate Intelligence Committee already had copies of an extensive file of Trump campaign emails that included emails between Papadopoulos and the campaign.

One email shows Manafort had been discussing Papadopoulos’ efforts to arrange a Trump visit to Russia with at least one other campaign official.

PLEA DEAL

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on Oct. 5, according to a court statement by Mueller’s office. As part of a plea deal, Papadopoulos agreed to plead guilty to making a “materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement” to FBI agents.

“Through his false statements and omissions, defendant Papadopoulos impeded the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the Campaign and the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,” a court document said.

The FBI arrested Papadopoulos on July 27 after he arrived at Dulles International Airport near Washington.

In an Oct. 5 letter to the Chicago man’s lawyer, Mueller and his team noted that Papadopoulos faced up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $9,500. But they agreed “to bring to the court’s attention at sentencing the defendant’s efforts to cooperate with the government” on condition that he continued providing information on to prosecutors, the document said.

Court documents said Papadopoulos lied to the FBI shortly after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, when the law enforcement agency had an open investigation into the alleged Russian government efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign.

In addition to lying about the timing of his contacts with the professor, prosecutors said Papadopoulos mischaracterised his contacts with that individual as “inconsequential.”

“In truth and in fact, however, defendant Papadopoulos understood the professor to have substantial connections to high-level Russian government officials and that the professor spoke with some of those officials in Moscow” before telling Papadopoulos about the “dirt” on Clinton, said the prosecutors.

The prosecutors said Papadopoulos also lied to the FBI in saying that a meeting the professor arranged for him in London with an unidentified Russian woman with ties to senior Russian officials occurred before the Chicago man joined the campaign.

The meeting took place on or about March 24, 2016, and the Russian woman was introduced to Papadopoulos as a relative of Putin, although it turned out that she was not related to the Russian leader, according to the documents.

Papadopoulos then worked with the professor and the Russian woman to set up the Putin meeting, and kept other Trump foreign policy advisers appraised of his contacts, they said.

In one email, the documents said, the Russian woman told Papadopoulos that ”The Russian Federation would love to welcome him (Trump) once his candidature would be officially announced.”

The prosecutors said that on or about March 31 Papadopoulos attended a “national security meeting” in Washington with then-candidate Trump and other campaign foreign policy advisers. When he introduced himself to the group, the prosecutors said, “he stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then candidate Trump and President Putin.”

In mid-April, the professor introduced Papadopoulos via an email to an individual in Moscow who the documents dubbed the Russian MFA Connection - MFA being the initials for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The pair had multiple conversations over the proceeding weeks about setting the “groundwork” for a Trump-Putin meeting.",Former Trump adviser Papadopoulos pleads guilty to lying to FBI,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-russia-papadopolous/former-trump-adviser-papadopolous-pleads-guilty-to-false-statements-idUKKBN1CZ1RR

The Republican president, who is considering Powell, current Fed Chair Janet Yellen and three others for the top central bank job, will announce his decision on Thursday, a White House official said separately.

By picking Powell, a soft-spoken centrist and Fed governor since 2012, Trump would get the combination of a leadership change and the continuity offered by somebody who has been a part of the Yellen-run Fed that has kept the economy and markets steady in recent years.

Powell, 64, has supported Yellen’s general direction in setting monetary policy, and in recent years has shared her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates.

“Powell has not offended people, and that’s a huge advantage in Washington. He’s the kind of guy who can get through Senate confirmation, and this administration has so many other problems to deal with,” said John Silva, chief economist at Wells Fargo.

The main challenger to Powell is Stanford University economist John Taylor, a favorite of conservative Republicans who believe monetary policy has been too loose under Yellen and want the central bank to rely more on rules when setting rates.

Taylor has spent the last two decades refining and pushing for wider use of a rule that sets out where rates should be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. His rule implies they should be higher than they are now.

Critics say that a Taylor-run Fed would run the risk of tightening monetary policy too fast and choking off the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

The race for the Fed job has shifted between Yellen, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama to a one-year term in 2014, Powell and Taylor in recent weeks. Financial markets had pushed Treasury yields higher on talk Taylor would get the job.

U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis pours a glass of water for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as they arrive to testify about authorizations for the use of military force before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. October 30, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

“War is fundamentally unpredictable,” Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told a Senate hearing about a potential new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, Congress’ most significant step in years toward taking back control of its constitutional right to authorize war.

Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson both said existing authorizations should not be repealed until new ones are in place, and stressed that they believe current AUMFs provide sufficient legal authority for ongoing military action.

“The 2001 AUMF provides statutory authority for ongoing U.S. military operations against al-Qaeda; the Taliban; and associated forces, including against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,” Tillerson said in his opening statement.

Republican and Democratic members of Congress have been arguing for years that Congress ceded too much authority over the deployment of U.S. forces to the White House after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. They are also divided over how much control they should exert over the Pentagon. Repeated efforts to write and pass a new AUMF have failed.

Under the Constitution, Congress, not the president, has the right to declare war.

Concerns intensified this month after four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger and previously over Trump’s talk about dealing with North Korea and an April attack on an airfield in Syria.

Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the foreign relations committee, told the hearing the ambush in Niger shows that U.S. forces “can find themselves in combat at any moment.”

‘GLOBAL, ENDLESS, SHADOW WAR’

Congress has not passed an AUMF since the 2002 measure authorizing the Iraq War. But the legal justification for most military action for the past 16 years is the older authorization passed days after the Sept. 11 attacks, for the campaign against al Qaeda and affiliates.

Backers of a new AUMF say the 2001 authorization has let presidents wage war wherever they like, without spelling out any strategy for Congress, or the public. For example, Islamic State did not exist when the 2001 AUMF was passed.

“I do not think the American people want the United States conducting a global, endless ‘Shadow War,’ under-the-radar, covert and beyond scrutiny,” said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel.

Mattis told the hearing he was not averse to a new authorization.

“Any new congressional expression of unity, whether or not an AUMF, would present a strong statement to the world of America’s determination,” he said in his opening statement.

But he said imposing limits would help America’s adversaries.

“We are more likely to end this fight sooner if we don’t tell our adversary the day we intend to stop fighting,” Mattis said.

Trump’s fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives but there are deep divisions over any possible new authorization within the party, as well as between Republicans and Democrats.

Many more hawkish Republicans do not want a measure exerting too much control over the Pentagon and say military commanders should decide how to fight America’s enemies.

GE is investing about $2.1 billion in GE Digital this year, and executives had said that amount would fall in 2018.

Flannery on Wednesday made his first direct remarks about the digital strategy since he became CEO on Aug. 1. He has begun slashing costs in other areas, including reducing staff, grounding corporate jets and axing the “Maserati benefit” of corporate cars for about 600 senior executives.

Flannery is due to unveil new financial targets on Nov. 13 and is under heavy pressure to turn GE around after the company’s third-quarter earnings and cash flow badly missed targets. GE stock is down 32 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up 14 percent,

GE’s digital strategy is built around a cloud-based software platform, known as Predix, that connects factories, power plants and other industrial equipment to computers that improve performance and predict outages.

But Predix’s limited capabilities and performance problems have caused GE to lose out to competitors such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and startups such as Uptake and C3IOT.

Flannery said on Wednesday that GE will focus on selling Predix in its own businesses: energy, oil-and-gas, aviation, healthcare, transportation and mining, as Reuters reported in August.

In other markets, “We’re going to be more selective ... and do it largely through partners,” Flannery said at GE’s annual Minds + Machines conference.

Gary Mintchell, chief executive of The Manufacturing Connection, an industrial-internet-focused research and consulting company, said GE’s strategy of using partners reflects the company’s realization that “they can’t build their own ecosystem.”

GE said it was expanding its partnership with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), to provide access to Microsoft applications on Predix. The specifics largely duplicated what the companies said when they first announced the deal in July 2016.

GE said Predix will be available on Azure in North America on Nov. 30, months later than the original target of the second quarter. Predix will still be available on Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services cloud platform, GE said.

GE Digital’s chief executive, Bill Ruh, on Wednesday noted a partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N). GE also is linking Predix with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) IOS operating system for iPhones and iPads.

Patrick Franklin, vice president in charge of Predix, said there was still room to improve Predix after the company held a two-month time-out this year to fix bugs, but the platform was showing near-100 percent stability.

“We are paying careful attention to quality,” he said, referring to the delay in deploying Predix on Azure.

GE executives said the company is focusing on developing apps for Predix to boost sales. GE plans to bundle applications for equipment monitoring and service technicians, both of which it bought last year.

GE said orders for Predix were rising sharply. Some customers at the event echoed that view. U.S. utility Exelon Corp (EXC.N), for instance, said it is rolling out Predix to its nuclear, gas, wind and other power plants after a two-year pilot of the system showed it worked as advertised, said Brian Hoff, director of corporate strategy and innovation at Exelon.

“If it didn’t hit its targets, we wouldn’t be moving forward,” Hoff said.",GE's CEO sees more partnerships ahead for digital business,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-digital-presentation/ges-ceo-sees-more-partnerships-ahead-for-digital-business-idUSKBN1CU2IC

The ECB last week said it would cut its bond purchases in half from January, but extended the programme until the end of September, promised years of stimulus and left the door open to backtracking, citing muted price pressures.

This careful approach is opposed by Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann who before the ECB policy meeting last week demanded a quick and consistent withdrawal of monetary support.

ECB chief Mario Draghi said on Thursday the central bank’s decisions were not unanimous and that there was a large majority on certain but not all policy measures approved by the ECB governing council, of which Weidmann is a member.

Data published in Germany showed that annual consumer price inflation in the states of Saxony, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Baden-Wuerttemberg slowed in October.

Prices fell on the month in three of the five states. In four regions, annual inflation ranged between 1.5 and 1.6 percent, below the ECB’s target of just below 2 percent. In the fifth region, Saxony, the reading was highest at 1.8 percent.

The annual figures for the five states had ranged from 1.8 percent to 2.1 percent in September.

A Reuters poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested that pan-German EU-harmonised inflation slowed to 1.7 percent in October from 1.8 percent in September.

Preliminary data for the whole euro zone is due on Tuesday and should show an unchanged value of 1.5 percent in October, according to a Reuters poll.

The German economy grew by 0.7 percent on the quarter between January and March and by 0.6 percent in the second quarter, driven by household and state spending as consumers and authorities reap the benefits of record-low borrowing costs and a low unemployment rate.

The national electoral commission announced this month that an election to replace Kabila, whose mandate expired last December, cannot take place until April 2019. The delay has raised fears of a new escalation of violence in the Central African giant.

Activist groups in the eastern Congo city of Goma had called for a general strike on Monday to protest against the election delay.

Unrest broke out by 5 a.m. (0700 GMT) between police and protesters, who barricaded roads and burned tires, said Thomas D‘Acquin, head of an activist group in North Kivu province.

Patrick Maki, a local journalist, said he witnessed protesters beat one police officer to death.

D‘Aquin told Reuters that at least one civilian had been killed in addition to one police officer. Gunshots could be heard for several hours, he said.

The provincial police commander, Placide Nyembo, said he did not yet have information on casualties but that police were removing the barricades and had the situation under control.

“We know who is behind this: politicians who work anonymously, distributing tracts and messages on the internet,” Nyembo said.

Deteriorating security across Congo this year, including a spike in militia violence, has prompted fears the country could slip back to the multi-sided civil wars of the turn of the century, when hundreds of thousands were killed in violence and millions are believed to have perished of hunger and disease.

Kabila says the election delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters. His opponents suspect he plans to change the constitution to remain in power, as other African leaders have done, which he denies.",At least one police officer killed in violent east Congo protest,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CZ0XB-OZATP

The killing of Zongo, who had been investigating the murder of a driver who worked for Francois Compaore, became a symbol of repression during Blaise Compaore’s 27-year rule, which ended in 2014 at the hands of a popular uprising.

It was not immediately clear why Francois Compaore had been released or whether he was free to leave the country. His lawyer, Pierre-Olivier Sur, did not respond to follow-up questions sent by text message and the prosecutor’s office handling the case could not be reached for comment.

Sur says the charges against his client are politically motivated by a Burkinabe government unable to try Blaise Compaore, whom the government of neighbouring Ivory Coast refuses to extradite.

Blaise Compaore fled to Ivory Coast during the uprising. He faces an international arrest warrant in connection with the 1987 murder of former president Thomas Sankara.

Activists are pushing President Roch Marc Christian Kabore to aggressively pursue cases of past human rights abuses, and critics say his government has been too slow to move against former regime members, some of whom serve in the current administration.",France releases brother of ex-Burkina president Compaore,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CZ1W1-OZATP

Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main man-made greehouse gas, hit 403.3 parts per million (ppm), up from 400.0 in 2015, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said in its annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin.

That growth rate was 50 percent faster than the average over the past decade, driving CO2 levels 45 percent above pre-industrial levels and further outside the range of 180-280 ppm seen in recent cycles of ice ages and warmer periods.

“Today’s CO2 concentration of ~400 ppm exceeds the natural variability seen over hundreds of thousands of years,” the WMO bulletin said.

The latest data adds to the urgency of a meeting in Bonn next month, when environment ministers from around the world will work on guidelines for the Paris climate accord backed by 195 countries in 2015.

The agreement is already under pressure because U.S. President Donald Trump has said he plans to pull the United States out of the deal, which seeks to limit the rise in temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

Human CO2 emissions from sources such as coal, oil, cement and deforestation reached a record in 2016, and the El Niño weather pattern gave CO2 levels a further boost, the WMO said.

As far as scientists can tell, the world has never experienced a rise in carbon dioxide like that of recent decades, which has happened 100 times faster than when the world was emerging from the last ice age.

Scientists know prehistoric levels from tiny air bubbles found in ancient Antarctic ice cores, and they can derive even older data from fossils and chemicals trapped in sediment.

The last time carbon dioxide levels reached 400 ppm was 3-5 million years ago, in the mid-Pliocene era.

“During that period, global mean surface temperatures were 2–3°C warmer than today, ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica melted and even parts of East Antarctica’s ice retreated, causing the sea level to rise 10–20 m higher than that today,” the WMO bulletin said.

Since 1990, the global warming effect of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases has risen by 40 percent. The two other main gases - methane and nitrous oxide - also grew to record concentrations last year, although at a slower rate of increase than carbon dioxide.","Carbon dioxide levels grew at record pace in 2016, U.N. says",https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-greenhouse/carbon-dioxide-levels-grew-at-record-pace-in-2016-u-n-says-idUKKBN1CZ0YB

People walk past the Bank of England in London, Britain, October 17, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay

Having cut rates to a record low 0.25 percent in August 2016 after Britons voted to leave the European Union, the Bank is now correcting course and falling in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which are either raising rates or scaling back stimulus.

Whereas the United States and the euro zone are enjoying robust growth, however, Britain’s economy has grown at its slowest pace in more than four years over the past 12 months.

Quarterly growth of 0.4 percent offers the weakest backdrop to any rate rise since the Bank became independent in 1997.

True, inflation is at a five-year high of 3.0 percent, a full percentage point above the Bank’s target, but that is mainly because the pound is an average 11 percent weaker against the currencies of Britain’s main trading partners since the Brexit vote.

The Bank has often overlooked past spikes in inflation if they were caused by currency fluctuations that were deemed to be temporary.

Inflation is set to fall this time too, but only slowly, as the Bank judges domestic inflation pressures are pending.

Partly due to stagnant productivity since the 2008 financial crisis - and partly due to concerns about the effect of Brexit on immigration, trade and investment - BoE Governor Mark Carney thinks the economy cannot grow as fast as it has in the past without generating excess inflation.

“We’re in a new paradigm,” says George Buckley, an economist at Nomura who was one of the first to sense a change at the central bank earlier this year, when most economists were saying they did not expect rates to rise until 2019.

Raising rates now would be the biggest call on monetary policy Carney has made as governor, and may shape his legacy.

Carney has faced criticism from economists who say his past guidance on monetary policy has been unhelpful, and from Brexit supporters who say he is too focused on the risks of leaving the EU. But until recently his broad approach to interest rates has been fairly uncontroversial.

For most BoE watchers, the likelihood of a rate rise only became clear in September, when minutes of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee’s meeting that month showed underlying price pressures were no longer a minority concern.

Two policymakers voted for a rate rise, and a majority of the others said they expected to do so “over the coming months”.

RAISING RATES “MAD”

Almost all economists polled by Reuters last week expect the Bank to raise interest rates to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent on Thursday. Most do not expect another one next year and 70 percent said even one rate rise would be a mistake. The latter view is common in markets, too.

“Personally, I think it would be mad,” Jim McCaughan, chief executive of Principal Global Investors, which manages $430 billion of assets, told Reuters earlier this month.

“You’d be tightening at a time of economic softness to defend against a weakness in sterling that you need (to boost exports).”

The Bank says its policy decisions are not driven by exchange rates. When Carney gives his news conference at 1230 GMT on Thursday, he is likely to focus on a 42-year low in unemployment and how it heralds more upward pressure on wages and inflation.

The Bank has been here before, however. Unemployment has repeatedly fallen further than the BoE forecast in recent years, while wage growth has remained stubbornly around 2 percent, half the 4 percent rate associated with pre-crisis rate rises.

Investors will be keen to glean what is meant in practise by the Bank’s long-standing stated expectation that it will only raise rates “at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”.

Markets have priced in an almost 90 percent chance of a rate rise on Thursday, but then expect the Bank to wait until late 2018 before raising again, Nomura’s Buckley said.

He said that was probably too long for the BoE’s tastes. On the other hand, however, Carney will not want to box himself in or lead the wider public to believe he plans to return rates to their pre-crisis level of around 5 percent.

Economists do not expect one or two rate rises will hurt growth much unless businesses or the public think many more will come and curb spending as a result.

BoE forecasts showing inflation is still expected to exceed its target even after three years might be the clearest sign that the Bank thinks faster rate rises are needed, Buckley said.

Either way, the stakes are high both for the Bank and its governor, who has said he will step down at the end of June 2019.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

Some 80 protesters outside the Cinematheque Française, which is showcasing Polanski’s films next month, banged on windows and carried posters with slogans such as, “If rape is an art, give Polanski all the (French movie award) Cesars”.

Two members of the Femen group briefly exposed their breasts and shouted “no honors for rapists” in the presence of Polanski before security pushed them outside.

Polanski, who had entered the building through a back entrance, was set to present his new movie “Based on a True Story” at the event.

Earlier this month, Swiss prosecutors said former German actress and model Renate Langer had told authorities that Polanski raped her at his mountain chalet in 1972 when she was 15 years old.

Langer is one of four women who have publicly accused Polanski, 84, of sexually assaulting them when they were teenagers.

The allegations predate the Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal.

Polanski, director of classic films like Rosemary’s Baby, The Pianist and Carnage, has fled U.S. sentencing in 1978 for unlawful sex with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in Los Angeles in 1977 in a case where he pleaded guilty at the time.

“Polanski has no place in an homage organized by a public cultural institution in France. He should be in a US court of justice,” Raphaelle Remy-Leleu, spokeswoman for feminist group “Osez le féminisme” said on French CNews television.

She said the Cinematheque Française was “spitting in the face of victims of male aggression” and complicit to the impunity of the aggressors.

The Cinematheque said in a statement to French media that the organization is honoring Polanski’s work and wants to steer clear of the legal case against him. French Culture Minister Francoise Nyssen has also defended the Polanski retrospective.

“This is about his life’s work, not about the man,” she said on radio France Inter on Friday.

In a statement to Reuters last week, Polanski’s lawyer reiterated that Polanski has acknowledged having had a sexual relationship with Geimer, and repeated that he strongly denies all other allegations against him as totally baseless.

In 2009, Swiss authorities arrested Polanski on his arrival in Zurich to receive a lifetime achievement award at a film festival. Two months later, he was released on bail and put under house arrest in his Gstaad chalet.

In July 2010, he was released from house arrest after authorities decided against extradition because of potential technical faults in the U.S. request and because he had for years come to Switzerland in good faith.

The indictment against Manafort and Gates says they both generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from U.S. authorities between 2006 and through at least 2016.

In June, Manafort and Gates retroactively registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents, in a Foreign Agents Registration Act filing that showed they earned $17.1 million for lobbying on behalf of the Party of Regions, a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, between 2012 and 2014.

The indictment said they concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties. They used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, prosecutors said. The indictment says that more than $75 million flowed through Manafort’s and Gates’ offshore accounts. Manafort, the indictment said, laundered more than $18 million.

The indictment also alleges Manafort and Gates, along with others, conspired to defraud the United States by “impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful governmental functions” of the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department between 2006 and 2017.

Manafort was indicted on nine counts and Gates was indicted on eight counts.

What are Manafort’s links to Trump?

Manafort joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016 and later became campaign manager, but he was forced to resign in August as questions emerged about his previous work for the political party of the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovich.

Business Insider reported that Manafort and Trump have been connected since the 1980s, when Trump hired Manafort’s lobbying firm to help the Trump Organization.

In 2006, Manafort and his wife bought an apartment in Trump Tower in New York, which Manafort still owns and where he lives when he is in Manhattan, Business Insider reported.

How do the charges relate to Trump?

“It has nothing to do with the campaign or the allegations of collusion with Russia,” said Washington attorney John Dowd, who represents Trump in the Russia probe.

A Trump confidante said: “As it relates to the president, this is nothing. All of the 12 counts of the indictment that came down today, all of it predates their tenure at the campaign.”

The special counsel’s indictment says Manafort and Gates laundered the money through “scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts” from approximately 2006 through “at least 2016.”

Who is Rick Gates?

Rick Gates was Manafort’s deputy and business associate. According to two former high-level Trump staffers, Gates essentially functioned as the Trump campaign manager for more than two months, all while not collecting a paycheck.

The New York Times reported in June that the Trump transition team had been ordered to preserve materials related to ongoing investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. According to the Times, the memo from the special counsel’s office to the former transition team also sought specific information on five people including Manafort and Gates.

According to the indictment, between at least 2006 and 2015 Manafort and Gates acted as unregistered agents of the Ukrainian government, a Ukrainian political party that was headed by Ukraine’s then president, Yanukovich, and Yanukovich himself. The indictment said they both generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work.

Yanukovich has been living in exile in Russia since he was ousted by mass street protests in Kiev in 2014. His departure lit the fuse for Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and a separatist uprising in mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.

The indictment said Gates aided Manafort in obtaining money from offshore accounts and that Gates used that money to pay for personal expenses including “his mortgage, children’s tuition, and interior decorating of his Virginia residence.”

How significant is Gates’ arrest?

The indictment lays out the extent of Gates’ involvement with Manafort going back years. That could potentially open the door for Gates to testify against Manafort and others in the future. David Sklansky, a professor at Stanford Law School and former federal prosecutor, said Gates could feel pressure to cooperate and provide testimony against Trump.",Who are Paul Manafort and Rick Gates?,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-q-a/who-are-paul-manafort-and-rick-gates-idUSKBN1CZ21T

In a board meeting at Japan’s SoftBank on Friday, several directors expressed doubts about giving up control of Sprint in any deal, the sources said, the latest twist in on-and-off talks to unite the two U.S. wireless carriers that began earlier this summer.

According to tentative deal terms that Reuters was first to report last month, SoftBank and other Sprint shareholders would have received close to 40 percent or a little more of the combined company.

The holdup in negotiations could torpedo plans to merge Sprint and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom, into a single carrier with more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N).

It could also damage the dealmaking credentials of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who has raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, and uses his image as a reliable counterparty to clinch deals.

If talks fall apart, it would be the second time an attempted merger of Sprint and T-Mobile has failed. The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014, but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

EXPLORING OPTIONS

Industry watchers had long expected Sprint and T-Mobile to attempt another deal, especially after a quiet period associated with a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves concluded in April, freeing up companies in the telecom industry to discuss mergers and acquisitions.

But no deal was announced immediately following the conclusion of the restriction on merger talks, and both Sprint and T-Mobile said they were open to exploring other options. A source told Reuters in July that SoftBank was considering an acquisition offer for Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) in a deal where it would combine the cable company with Sprint.

Sprint is in the middle of a turnaround plan and has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs. But industry analysts have expressed concern that the company, weighed down with total debt of $38 billion, has few financial options. Even though its customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by heavy discounting.

Sprint’s junk bonds were among the hardest hit in Monday afternoon trading, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters capital markets news service.

Claure said in August that while Sprint could sustain itself, cost savings from a transaction were significantly better than remaining a standalone entity. Analysts have estimated a deal could result in more than $30 billion in savings.

Sprint shares fell as much as 13 percent on Monday after Nikkei first reported that SoftBank was doubting the deal, and ended down 9.3 percent. T-Mobile shares ended down 5.4 percent.

Nikkei also reported that SoftBank would inform Germany’s Deutsche Telekom that it was calling off the deal talks, but sources who spoke to Reuters could not confirm this.

As of late Monday, T-Mobile still considered the negotiations with Sprint to be active, according to the sources.

Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank declined to comment.

DUE DILIGENCE ALMOST COMPLETE

The due diligence between T-Mobile and Sprint was almost complete as of last week, and the focus had shifted to working out a business plan for the combined company as well as an integration strategy, sources had told Reuters.

Even so, it was not clear that U.S. regulators would clear a deal between the two carriers.

Analysts have expected consolidation in the U.S. wireless industry to ease pricing pressure in the market, which could benefit AT&T and Verizon, who have lost share to their smaller rivals. Cable companies Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) are also entering the market with wireless service on Verizon’s airwaves.

“With no merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as the entrance of Comcast and Charter into wireless, we expect Verizon to have a difficult run going forward,” said Philip Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a research note. Verizon shares closed down 2.1 percent.

“Sprint as well could struggle to maintain positive subscriber momentum as cable enters, making its balance sheet look unsustainable.”

Shares in satellite television provider Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), which has been widely considered a potential partner for T-Mobile or Sprint because of its spectrum holdings, closed up 4 percent.","SoftBank, Deutsche Telekom hit wall in Sprint, T-Mobile talks: sources",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile-us/softbank-deutsche-telekom-hit-wall-in-sprint-t-mobile-talks-sources-idUSKBN1CZ265?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

ANO won nearly three times as many votes as its closest competitor in a parliamentary election this month when voters shunned traditional parties but fell short of a majority in the lower house.

Since then, the other eight parties that won seats have refused cooperation with ANO with the exception of the SPD, a far-right, anti-European Union party that is not a preferred coalition partner for Babis.

The businessman ran on an anti-establishment platform and pledged to fight political corruption but he faces potential fraud charges himself.

The ANO has 78 seats in the 200-seat lower house and is considering forming a minority government but it must win a confidence vote with a simple majority of those present.

The head of the far-left Communist party (KSCM) said he could tolerate a minority cabinet as a way out of the impasse.

“It is a question of how much the government’s program would fit us, to tolerate this government,” KSCM chairman Vojtech Filip told Czech Television. “I am not saying we will support it, I am speaking about tolerance.”

KSCM with its 15 seats would have to leave the lower house during a confidence vote thus lowering the threshold ANO would need to win.

President Milos Zeman, who will meet with Babis on Tuesday, told Czech Radio a minority government would be a good option.

Most parties shun Babis and his ANO party because of the fraud charges. Police say he hid ownership of a farm and conference center near Prague in 2008 so he could qualify for a 2 million euro EU subsidy normally meant for small businesses.

Babis denies wrongdoing and says the charges were politically motivated.

The approximately 2-foot (0.61-meter) robots come with a tower that is fitted with cameras that scan aisles to check stock and identify missing and misplaced items, incorrect prices and mislabeling. The robots pass that data to store employees, who then stock the shelves and fix errors.

Out-of-stock items are a big problem for retailers since they miss out on sales every time a shopper cannot find a product on store shelves.

Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer has been testing shelf-scanning robots in a handful of stores in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and California.

“If you are running up and down the aisle and you want to decide if we are out of Cheerios or not, a human doesn’t do that job very well, and they don’t like it,” Jeremy King, chief technology officer for Walmart U.S. and e-commerce, told Reuters.

The company said the robots would not replace workers or affect employee headcount in stores.

The robots are 50 percent more productive than their human counterparts and can scan shelves significantly more accurately and three times faster, King said. Store employees only have time to scan shelves about twice a week.

The idea of installing robots to automate retail is not new. Rival Amazon.com Inc uses small Kiva robots in its warehouses to handle picking and packing, saving almost 20 percent in operating expenses.

For Wal-Mart, the move is part of a broader effort to digitize its stores to make shopping faster.

In the past year, it has installed giant “pickup towers” that operate like self-service kiosks and where customers can pick up their online orders.

The company has also speeded up the checkout process by allowing customers to scan their own purchases, and it has digitized operations like pharmacy and financial services in stores.

The initiative comes as President Donald Trump is trying to lighten rules on Wall Street and the bank regulator, Keith Noreika, acting Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), must weigh whether to vet new Wells Fargo executives.

If Noreika’s approach prevails, the OCC could go easier on Wells Fargo and any other large banks sanctioned in the future.

Since Noreika took control of the OCC in May, he has advocated easing up on sanctions imposed on Wells Fargo in the wake of the scandal over abusive sales practices, according to current and former officials.

Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement in September 2016 after admitting that its sales staff opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers’ consent. Since then the estimate has climbed to as many as 3.5 million.

As part of the deal with regulators, incoming Wells Fargo executives can face a vetting from the OCC while severance payouts must be cleared by the OCC and a sister agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

But Noreika wants officials to work faster when they review severance pay and the agency can choose to waive its check on incoming executives.

Wells Fargo declined comment on the reviews.

Hundreds of Wells Fargo employees have had their severance payouts frozen when they left as regulators tried to determine what role those employees might have had in the scandal.

Under one proposal floated by the OCC, departing employees would collect severance automatically if regulators could not finish their review within weeks, according to one current and two former officials who were not authorized to discuss an internal debate.

Under another scenario, the OCC could push for payouts to a Wells Fargo employee without waiting for the FDIC to concur. The FDIC has the final say on severance and until now the decisions have always been made jointly.

The FDIC has resisted hurrying its severance reviews, according to those familiar with the discussions.

But the current FDIC chief, Martin Gruenberg, could be replaced within weeks by a President Trump nominee.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo branch is seen in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, U.S. February 10, 2015. REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo

If that happens and Noreika prevails, it could provide relief for Wells Fargo as it faces fresh scrutiny for wrongly charging customers for car insurance and mortgages.

Noreika is expected to leave the OCC in coming weeks, but the matter could be settled by Joseph Otting, the former banker who is Trump’s permanent pick for the OCC. Otting is expected to favor a similar, light touch approach to financial rules.

PAYOUTS

The “golden parachute” rule is meant to halt payouts to employees who played a role in a bank’s problems, but Noreika has said too many innocent Wells Fargo employees are caught up in the reviews.

In a June 5 letter to a former Wells Fargo employee made public by the OCC, Noreika said that he had personally called Gruenberg to expedite a payment.

In the weeks after that letter was sent, sources said, the OCC has proposed speeding up the reviews, but the FDIC pushed back against setting “artificial” deadlines, according to one official.

“The OCC has sought ways to make regulatory reviews more efficient (and) complete in weeks not months,” OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard said, while declining to discuss inter-agency deliberations.

The FDIC defended the pace of its severance audits, which in some cases have taken months to finish.

“When delays occur, it is generally because the applying institution provided incomplete or inconsistent information,” said Barbara Hagenbaugh, spokeswoman for the FDIC.

Severance payouts are simple to calculate for rank-and-file Wells Fargo employees who can get two weeks’ pay for each year of work. It gets more complex for senior executives who get a mix of salary, bonuses, stocks and other perks.

For example, James Strother, the bank’s former chief counsel who retired this summer, was among senior Wells Fargo executives that had $32 million in payouts frozen in March. But Strother has yet to repay a $310,000 interest-free loan Wells Fargo granted him in 2001, a year before such insider loans were banned, according to securities filings and the bank.

“Mr. Strother has informed us that he does plan on paying back the loan, as required and expected,” said Diana Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo.

Strother declined to comment.

According to several former officials, the FDIC has authority to scrutinize such loans under their ‘golden parachute’ review, adding another layer of complexity to the process.",U.S. regulator wants to loosen leash on Wells Fargo: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-compensation/u-s-regulator-wants-to-loosen-leash-on-wells-fargo-sources-idUSKBN1CZ0D8

But Goushi Kataoka, a newcomer to the board, may propose ramping up stimulus after dissenting last month to a decision to stand pat on policy, setting back the BOJ’s quest to dial back its massive monetary support, analysts say.

At the two-day meeting ending on Tuesday, the BOJ is set to keep intact a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year bond yield around zero percent.

The market’s focus would be on whether Kataoka will propose expanding stimulus. While any such proposal is likely to be voted down, it may expose a rift in the nine-member board on the future direction of monetary policy.

“If Kataoka proposes additional easing, that would be an important turning point for future debate on monetary policy,” said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.

“The proposal could mark a starting point for shifting the debate within and outside the BOJ, from seeking an exit from easy policy to strengthening stimulus,” he said.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will likely hold a briefing at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision.

In a quarterly review of its projections, the BOJ is seen trimming its inflation forecast for the current year ending in March 2018 from the 1.1 percent it estimated made in July, sources say.

The bank is seen roughly maintaining its price forecasts for fiscal 2018 and 2019, as well as its view that inflation will hit the 2 percent target by March 2020, they said.

The BOJ currently projects inflation will hit 1.5 percent in fiscal 2018 and 1.8 percent the following year.

Japan’s economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and corporate spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.

Gates, who had been working as a consultant for Colony for six months, according to the spokesman, was indicted on Monday on charges of conspiracy to launder money and failing to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government.

The charges were part of a probe by Robert Mueller, a special counsel appointed to investigate whether Russia tried to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor, and whether members of the Trump campaign colluded in any such effort.

The contract between Whitefish Energy Holdings and Puerto Rico’s bankrupt power utility came under fire after it was revealed last week that the terms were obtained without a competitive public bidding process. Residents, local officials and U.S. federal authorities all criticized the arrangement.

The cancellation could further complicate Puerto Rico’s most pressing challenge from the territory’s worst storm in 80 years - restoring power to its 3.4 million residents. Nearly six weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, only about a quarter of homes and businesses have power, and the utility has set a goal of having 95 percent of power back by the middle of December.

Several other utilities have been involved in recovery efforts, but Whitefish said they had more than 350 people on the island. Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority’s (PREPA) Director Ricardo Ramos said that he had to consider the “delay risk” of agreeing to cancel the contract. The territory has reached out to officials in Florida and New York, which have already sent people to Puerto Rico, to send more crews in the event that Whitefish departs.

Whitefish said in a statement it was “disappointed” in the decision, adding that it will “only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve – to have the power restored quickly in the same manner their fellow citizens on the mainland experience after a natural disaster.”

Earlier on Sunday, Puerto Rico’s Governor, Ricardo Rosselló had called for the contract with Whitefish to be canceled, and PREPA’s Ramos said he had accepted the governor’s recommendation.

“Following the information that has emerged, and with the goal of protecting public interest, as governor I am asking government and energy authorities to immediately activate the clause to cancel the contract to Whitefish Energy,” Rossello said in a statement.

Ramos, in a press conference Sunday, noted that the initial enthusiasm from residents over Whitefish employees coming to the island had shifted in the last several days after media reported the details of the contract.

“As soon as this whole issue was interpreted by the tabloids that PREPA has given away $300 million to a company with little experience…if you read that, and you have no light and no water that perception changes abruptly to the extent that the last four days they’ve been throwing stones and bottles” at workers, Ramos said.

Ramos said contract terms with Whitefish meant that the cancellation would become effective 30 days from notice and, signaling potential intricacies, explained that there were “a lot of logistics involved. I believe they have people on the way here.”

“The contract is not canceled as of yet. I am writing today a letter to the board of directors of PREPA asking for a resolution that will allow me to cancel the contract,” Ramos said.

Whitefish, which has a full-time staff of two, said it would complete any work that PREPA wanted it to, and noted their initial efforts “exceeded all other efforts by other parties.”

They said they completed work on two major transmission lines that crossed the island’s mountainous interior, and that PREPA’s decision to contact them “only sped up the repairs.”

Criticism increased after a copy of the contract with PREPA surfaced online on Thursday night and raised more questions, particularly over language blocking oversight of costs and profits.

Ramos noted that the federal contracting process is a long one, and that PREPA “could not wait.”

APPEAL TO NEW YORK, FLORIDA

Efforts to restore power have been bumpy. It took more than a week for a damage assessment to be completed, and PREPA did not immediately ask for what is known as “mutual aid,” whereupon utilities send workers in droves to restore power to hard-hit areas.

Residents have been forced to rely on diesel generators and most of the island remained in darkness.

Eventually, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was put in charge of power restoration. Rosselló said he had reached out to Florida and New York in part because of a delay in the arrival of brigades from the Army Corps.

Speaking to CNN, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he could send hundreds of work crews to Puerto Rico to assist with the repair work. Florida Governor Rick Scott’s office said he and Rossello “have talked frequently regarding Hurricane Maria recovery. Governor Scott is proud to offer any guidance, advice and assistance they may need.”

PREPA declared bankruptcy in July. It has a $9 billion debt load caused by years of unsuccessful rate collection efforts, particularly from municipal governments and state agencies, and a lack of investment in equipment and maintenance.

The Puerto Rican government is bracing for the possibility that Whitefish would sue for breach of contract if the cancellation is approved, according to sources familiar with discussions. The government already paid Whitefish $8 million and does not expect the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to reimburse that sum, the sources said.",Puerto Rico moves to cancel Whitefish power contract after uproar,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-power/puerto-rico-moves-to-cancel-whitefish-power-contract-after-uproar-idUSKBN1CY0L9

But Goushi Kataoka, a newcomer to the board, may propose ramping up stimulus after dissenting last month to a decision to stand pat on policy, setting back the BOJ’s quest to dial back its massive monetary support, analysts say.

At the two-day meeting ending on Tuesday, the BOJ is set to keep intact a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year bond yield around zero percent.

The market’s focus would be on whether Kataoka will propose expanding stimulus. While any such proposal is likely to be voted down, it may expose a rift in the nine-member board on the future direction of monetary policy.

“If Kataoka proposes additional easing, that would be an important turning point for future debate on monetary policy,” said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.

“The proposal could mark a starting point for shifting the debate within and outside the BOJ, from seeking an exit from easy policy to strengthening stimulus,” he said.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will likely hold a briefing at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision.

In a quarterly review of its projections, the BOJ is seen trimming its inflation forecast for the current year ending in March 2018 from the 1.1 percent it estimated made in July, sources say.

The bank is seen roughly maintaining its price forecasts for fiscal 2018 and 2019, as well as its view that inflation will hit the 2 percent target by March 2020, they said.

The BOJ currently projects inflation will hit 1.5 percent in fiscal 2018 and 1.8 percent the following year.

Japan’s economy expanded at an annualised 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and corporate spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.

The chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, Dara Khosrowshahi, arrived in Brazil to lobby against the bill that is due to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday and which threatens the company’s business in a fast-growing foreign market.

Brazil is Uber’s third-largest market, with 17 million users, and the city of Sao Paulo sees more trips on the ride-hailing service than any other city in the world, ahead of New York and Mexico City, according to the company.

A spokesman for the company said the application as it exists could not operate under the new rules, including the use of a taxi license plate on cars owned by Uber drivers.

“The business model we have today would not longer be viable,” Uber’s executive spokesman in Brazil Fabio Sabba told Reuters.

Uber is already battling to keep operating in London after the city’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service and refused to renew its license.

Police said 800 Uber drivers drove through the center of Brazil’s capital Brasilia to protest the bill that many say will put them out of business. Similar protests in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro snarled downtown traffic.

Uber did not organize the drivers’ protests but alerted authorities that they would happen.

“The bill will create so much bureaucracy that it prevents the 500,000 drivers in Brazil from earning income for their families,” Uber said in a statement.

Uber said it has paid 495 million reais ($150 million) in federal and municipal taxes so far this year.

The bill, which has already been approved by the lower house of Congress, would define ride hailing applications as public transport instead of private services and require drivers to get a special permit from city authorities. It would also establish additional regulations and taxes.

If the Senate votes to approve the bill, it will be up to President Michel Temer to sign or veto the legislation or parts of it.

Railway operator Deutsche Bahn continued to deal with “significant damage” from downed trees on some rail routes. Service will be limited in parts of northern Germany, DB said, after being suspended in large parts of the north and center of the country on Sunday, stranding thousands of travelers.

In the North Sea, authorities were monitoring the “Glory Amsterdam,” a 225-metre (742-foot) freighter that foundered 2.2 km (1.36 miles) from the German island of Langeoog, for any signs of oil leaks, said Michael Friedrich, spokesman for Germany’s Central Command for Maritime Emergencies.

But plans to tow the freighter free during high tide on Monday were being revised after officials determined the waters were too shallow for the ship that would have done the towing, Friedrich said. Instead, workers would seek to lighten the ship’s load and use ships with shallower draft for towing.

“We’re working on a plan, but the towing will definitely not happen today,” he said. The freighter’s captain had reported all was well on board and the ship’s crew of 22 was safe.

The freighter was not carrying any cargo, Friedrich said. Concern about an oil leak centered on 1,800 tonnes of heavy oil and 140 tonnes of marine diesel the ship had on board for fuel.

The non-profit environmental group World Wildlife Fund said the oil on board continued to pose a significant risk to the Wadden Sea, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and renewed its call for a worldwide ban on heavy oil for use as ship fuel.

The Wadden Sea is the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world. Including sand banks, salt marshes and dunes, it stretches from the Netherlands to neighboring Germany and Denmark.

“Numerous wading birds, ducks and geese that are resting there at the moment would be endangered by the oil” if the ship broke up, Hans-Ulrich Rosenberg, a mud flat expert with WWE, said in a statement.

A group representing German cutter and coastal fishermen questioned whether authorities had done enough to protect coastal areas. “This wasn’t exactly the storm of the century, which raises the question of whether the protections in place are sufficient,” said Dirk Sander, head of the group.

Elsewhere in Germany, Deutsche Bahn said rail traffic on a number of key routes - including the heavily traveled line from Hamburg to Berlin - would resume on Monday afternoon.

Thousands of travelers were stranded on Sunday, with some seeking shelter in special sleeping cars provided at stations.

The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party made progress in talks on Monday and they will continue talking on Tuesday, the British government’s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said.

“In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to Parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed,” Brokenshire said in a statement.

“The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night,” he said, adding that the British government would consider “certain additional requests” made by the parties.

Brokenshire had earlier indicated that if there was no deal by the end of Monday it would move to pass an annual budget for the region to ensure essential services are funded.

A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, which observers have warned could destabilize a delicate political balance in the region.

The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province.

But Sinn Fein in January pulled out complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.

Talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP have stalled in recent weeks, in large part over proposals to improve the rights of Irish language speakers.

Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said the government could only be reformed “on the basis of equality, rights and respect”, which would require concessions from the DUP.

While the DUP also said it wanted to see the executive re-established, ahead of the talks it called for London to bring forward the budget “to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland”.

Neither party spoke to assembled media on the state of the talks on Monday evening.

Amina Okuyeva and Adam Osmayev were in a car that was shot at from bushes near a railway crossing on the outskirts of the capital, interior ministry advisors Anton Gerashchenko and Zoryan Shkiryak said in separate posts on Facebook.

The attack follows a vehicle bombing in Kiev last Thursday, in which two people were killed and three wounded, including Ihor Mosiychuk, a member of the populist opposition Radical Party.

Okuyeva had links to Mosiychuk, having once worked for him in an advisory role.

“As a result of the injuries she sustained, Amina died. Adam Osmayev was wounded, but will live. I just spoke to him on the telephone,” Gerashchenko said.

The incident is the second attempt this year on the life of Osmayev, from Russia’s mainly Muslim Chechnya region. In June, he survived an attack by a gunman, who was in turn shot and wounded by Okuyeva.

Gerashchenko and Shkiryak did not suggest a motive for the latest incident.

SPATE OF BOMBINGS

Mosiychuk has blamed Russia for last week’s bombing, while Ukrainian police have said Russian involvement is one of the possible motives being investigated.

Russia has dismissed the accusations as a product of anti-Russian sentiment in Ukraine.

Relations between Kiev and Moscow collapsed in 2014 after Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and backed a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukrainian regions.

Russian authorities accuse Osmayev of being part of a 2012 plot by Islamist rebels to kill Putin with a bomb in central Moscow.

Osmayev and Okuyeva are well-known figures in Ukraine, having served as volunteers for the Ukrainian military in the fight against pro-Russian rebels.

Moscow has fought two wars with separatists in Chechnya since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The region is now broadly under the control of Moscow, but Chechens are known to have fought both for the pro-Russian rebels and for the Ukrainian army in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Since fighting broke out in the east in 2014, the number of incidents involving explosives outside the conflict zone has increased.

There has been a spate of vehicle bombings over the past 18 months in Kiev, the capital, and elsewhere, but investigators have failed to find those responsible.",Wife of Chechen accused of Putin assassination plot shot dead near Kiev,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-murder/wife-of-chechen-accused-of-putin-assassination-plot-shot-dead-near-kiev-idUKKBN1CZ2IP?il=0

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney-General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia’s secessionist government and called a snap regional election for Dec. 21, and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Monday’s calm on the streets of Barcelona resolved a weekend of uncertainty during which it was not clear how the region would respond to central control.

“THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON”

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started worked as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices though some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Two hundred thousand public sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and another 100,000 in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. This compared to 41.1 percent in July according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for sacked regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies who called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Woods, who continues to recover from back surgery and has not played competitively in nine months, will be part of an elite 18-player field.

“I am excited to return to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge,” tournament host and 14-time major champion Woods said in a statement.

”Albany is the perfect setting and it will be great to join this outstanding field...”

The 41-year-old American has only played six competitive rounds in the past two years while trying to recover from multiple back surgeries.

Last year Woods also made a comeback at the same event, ending nearly 16 months on the sidelines, and finished 15th in a final field of 17.

He showed flashes of the brilliant golf that carried him to 14 major titles. However, he also delivered the inept, often finding sandy waste areas off the tee or with his approach shots.

As his back issues continued, Woods returned to the PGA Tour in January. He missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open and shot an opening-round 77 a week later in Dubai before withdrawing.

In April he announced that he had undergone a fourth back operation in three years.

The winner of five tournaments in 2013, Woods has played just 19 events since.

”All of us would be overjoyed if Tiger Woods could come back and play at a high level,“ Woods’ former swing coach Butch Harmon told Sky Sports. ”He’s playing an appropriate event because there are only 18 players, even though they are top echelon players.

”It’s a more relaxed type of event. It’s his tournament. I think he’s going to feel a little more relaxed there.

“We’ll have to see how he is physically, how he is mentally and how his nervous system holds up.”

Woods will not find the competition any easier this year with a top flight field that includes Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, Jason Day, Rickie Fowler, Brooks Koepka, Matt Kuchar and Justin Rose.

The Hero World Challenge will be the latest in a long-running comeback saga that has produced more downs than ups.

The most recent embarrassing setback came last Friday when Woods pleaded guilty in a Florida court to reckless driving and entered a program for first-time offenders, avoiding a conviction on the charge of driving under the influence (DUI) last spring.

He was found asleep in May behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz, which was parked alongside a road not far from his home on Jupiter Island.

Woods had five drugs in his system when he was arrested, but no alcohol, according to a toxicology report. Those drugs included generic forms of the painkillers Vicodin and Dilaudid; the mood drug Xanax; the sleeping pill Ambien, and a drug that contained THC, the active ingredient in marijuana",Woods set to return in Bahamas next month,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CZ2MG-OCASP

That is the case with the $14 billion scrapped merger between Clariant and Huntsman, which would have combined two chemical makers with little overlap into what was effectively a conglomerate. Now that the merger is off, Clariant can consider other options. But there is a catch, in the form of the activist duo that killed the deal. Investors now need to know whether they are a catalyst, or an inhibitor.

White Tale, a shop-front for Keith Meister’s Corvex and fellow fund 40 North, bought a 20 percent stake in Clariant to convey its disapproval of the planned merger with U.S. peer Huntsman. Since a two-thirds majority vote was needed to approve the deal, and turnout at shareholder meetings is low, that was the end of that. The 6 percent drop in Clariant’s shares on Oct. 27, equivalent to around $500 million, compares with its $1.8 billion proportional share of the lump-sum value of estimated synergies. Investors had seen the writing on the wall.

Now comes the post-activist chill. White Tale holds shares worth around $1.6 billion in a cyclical business, at a time when interest rates could soon be rising in the world’s major industrial economies. Moreover, Meister’s plan is unclear. While he has had successes pushing KFC owner Yum! Brands into a spin-off of its Chinese business, his track record is hardly that of, say, Nelson Peltz, the seasoned investor calling for a clean-up of consumer brands group P&G, or Meister’s own former boss, Carl Icahn.

Clariant boss Hariolf Kottmann has, he concedes, other options. The company could be a takeover target for a rival like Evonik. And splitting off its plastics and coatings business is an old idea that may still create value. The risk is that the triumphant activist will push too hard to realise rapid cost savings. This is no Akzo Nobel, the troubled Dutch chemicals group pilloried by Elliott Advisors for its inaction when a bid arrived from U.S. peer PPG. White Tale has managed to make Clariant show restraint.

Hamas said Israel had made a “futile attempt to sabotage efforts to repair Palestinian unity”, a reference to the reconciliation agreement it reached with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, earlier this month.

However, neither Israel nor Hamas seemed eager to seek escalation. Israel was at pains to point out that its action against the tunnel was carried out on its own side of the border.

“The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) does not intend to escalate the situation but stands prepared for a variety of scenarios,” said Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman.

“The working assumption is that this is not the only tunnel that Palestinian terrorist organizations are trying to dig.”

The tunnel was being dug from the Gaza town of Khan Younis across the border, where it was blown up, Conricus said.

A source for the Islamic Jihad militant group said the head of the faction’s armed wing in central Gaza was killed along with a senior associate and other gunmen. It vowed revenge saying “all options are open for response.”

Hamas’s armed wing said two of its gunmen were killed while trying to rescue the Islamic Jihad men working in the tunnel. Gaza health officials said nine people were wounded. It said it would avenge “the blood of the martyrs.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in remarks to legislators of his right-wing Likud party, said “groundbreaking technology” aided the tunnel’s discovery, but gave no details.

Israel has been constructing a sensor-equipped underground wall along the 60-km (36-mile) Gaza border, aiming to complete the $1.1 billion project by mid-2019.

During the last Gaza war, in 2014, Hamas fighters used dozens of tunnels to blindside Israel’s superior forces and threaten civilian communities near the frontier, a counterpoint to the Iron Dome anti-missile system that largely protected the country’s heartland from militant rocket barrages.

Israel and the United States have called for Hamas to be disarmed as part of the pact between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, so Israeli peace efforts with Abbas, which collapsed in 2014, could proceed. Hamas has rejected the demand.

On Saturday, UNRWA, the main U.N. welfare agency for Palestinians, said it had discovered “what appeared to be a tunnel” underneath one of its schools in Gaza on Oct. 15 and had sealed the cavity.

U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt tweeted on Monday: “Hamas uses the world’s generosity to shield terror. Palestinians in Gaza deserve so much better.”",Seven killed as Israel destroys tunnel dug under Gaza border,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CZ1SR

La ricapitalizzazione da 49,98 milioni è iniziata oggi e terminerà il 16 novembre, con diritti negoziabili in borsa fino al 10 novembre. Esclusi i 3,5 milioni di spese connesse all‘offerta, in caso di totale adesione all‘aumento arriveranno al Gruppo 24 Ore 46,5 milioni di euro, si legge nel prospetto.

Al momento né le azioni né i relativi diritti sono riusciti a fare prezzo per la forte distanza tra prezzo rettificato e teorico: le prime hanno un prezzo indicativo di 1,792 euro contro una chiusura rettificata a 1,494 euro, con un‘ampia distanza tra bid e ask (1,792/1,4 euro). I diritti hanno un prezzo indicativo di 1,78 euro dalla parità teorica di 2,134 euro, con la forchetta bid/ask a 2,1/1,71 euro. Come spesso accade negli aumenti molto diluitivi, le azioni trattano in rialzo rispetto ai diritti perché beneficiano di un effetto “scarsità”.

Per la società che da inizio 2017 ha accertato la sussistenza della fattispecie prevista dall‘art. 2447 del Codice Civile, il fabbisogno patrimoniale confermato anche dall‘ultimo aggiornamento del piano industriale (4 settembre) è di 70 milioni di euro. Il nuovo piano include la cessione del 49% dell‘area Formazione ed Eventi al fondo Palamon dalla quale otterrà un effetto patrimoniale positivo di 55,6 milioni relativo alla plusvalenza connessa.

Si spiega nel prospetto, però, che anche con la piena esecuzione di queste due operazioni di rafforzamento patrimoniale, ormai avviate, la società potrebbe trovarsi nuovamente in una situazione di sofferenza patrimoniale qualora nell‘arco di piano i risultati fossero “significativamente” peggiori di quelli indicati dal business plan al 2020: “qualora l‘Emittente durante l‘arco temporale sopra indicato registrasse una progressiva erosione patrimoniale per un importo complessivamente pari a 37 milioni (corrispondente alla dotazione patrimoniale dell‘Emittente all‘esito dell‘Aumento di Capitale e dell‘Operazione Formazione), si configurerebbe la fattispecie di cui all‘art. 2447 del Codice Civile”.

E il complesso delle assunzioni poste alla base del nuovo Piano, ammette la stessa società, “risulta sfidante rispetto ai risultati conseguiti dal gruppo fino alla data della Nota di Sintesi e ai dati di settore prospettici”.

Il Gruppo Sole 24 Ore stima che il fabbisogno finanziario netto per i prossimi dodici mesi sia pari a 111,7 milioni e avverte di non disporre di un capitale circolante sufficiente per far fronte alle proprie esigenze.

Oltre alla ricapitalizzazione e alla cessione della Formazione (che dà a Palamon l‘opzione di salire al 51% nel 2018), il gruppo ha quindi sottoscritto con le banche finanziatrici due term sheet per Linee Revolving da 30 milioni di euro complessivi destinate a finanziare necessità di cassa derivanti dall‘ordinaria operatività aziendale non previste dal nuovo piano. Gli accordi definitivi sono attesi entro la fine del mese.

Nel contempo la società dovrà procedere al rimborso integrale del finanziamento bancario da 50 milioni più altre linee bilaterali in essere per un totale di 61,6 milioni complessivi. Lo stand still raggiunto con le banche scade infatti il 15 novembre.

Tra gli altri rischi citati, quello legato alla difficoltà di certificazione delle copie digitali vendute, che nel lungo termine potrebbero incidere sui ricavi pubblicitari, il rischio di sanzioni da ADS (certificatore delle copie diffuse) per le pregresse violazioni del regolamento, alcuni rischi fiscali e i rischi connessi alle indagini in corso condotte dalla procura di Milano e da Consob per false comunicazioni sociali e appropriazione indebita in cui la società si dichiara parte lesa.

Anche eventuali scioperi legati ai piani di riduzione del costo del lavoro potrebbero pesare sulla situazione economico patrimoniale del gruppo.

British finance minister Philip Hammond said this month that if Britain left without a deal, this could lead to flights being grounded, adding it was in the interests of all to avoid this.

“The prospect of there being no flying between the UK and Europe, I don’t agree with at all,” Walsh told a parliamentary committee. “This would bring all of Europe to a standstill.”

Flying rights to, from and within the EU, as well as between the United States and Britain are covered by EU-wide “Open Skies” agreements. But unlike with trade, where Britain would revert to WTO rules in the event of a “no deal”, there is no default fallback option for the aviation sector.

Walsh said though that the industry is used to dealing with new regulations at short notice, such as when a ban on liquids on board aircraft came into place.

He added that he would like more clarity about Britain’s role in the European Aviation Safety Agency after it leaves the EU and what rules it will follow, because that has implications for the way airlines maintain and operate their aircraft.

Consumer credit increased last month by 1.62 billion pounds, up from 1.48 billion pounds in September and taking the annual growth rate to 10.5 percent - the strongest since October 2005, Bank of England data showed on Tuesday.

Mortgage approvals for house purchases increased to 67,518 in October from 63,594 in September. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 65,000 mortgage approvals were made in October.

Britain’s economy has performed much better than most economists had expected in the immediate aftermath of June’s vote to leave the European Union, with households showing few signs of being fazed by the referendum result.

Less comprehensive figures from the British Bankers’ Association also showed consumer lending grew in October at the fastest pace in nearly 10 years.

But a much bigger test awaits in 2017.

Rising inflation caused by the pound’s post-referendum plunge looks set to squeeze household spending and economists said they still expected business investment to slow.

Recent sentiment surveys suggest households are becoming increasingly concerned about inflation following the pound’s post-Brexit vote plunge.

The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to peak at around 2.75 percent next year - some way above its 2 percent target.

The BoE said business lending increased for a second month in a row, rising 3.15 billion pounds from 1.0 billion in September and marking the largest upturn since February.

Mortgage lending in cash terms increased 3.28 billion pounds, up slightly from September’s 3.26 billion pound rise.

Netflix Inc and the show’s production company also issued a joint statement saying they were “deeply troubled” by actor Anthony Rapp’s allegation in a published interview that Spacey in 1986 had made a sexual advance toward Rapp, who was just 14 at the time.

Netflix did not give an explicit reason for deciding to air one more season of “House of Cards” before pulling the plug on the Emmy-winning, critically acclaimed show, its first original hit series.

But Netflix spokeswoman Karen Barragan said the decision was made months ago, long before the allegation surfaced against Spacey, 58, a two-time Oscar-winning film star, Tony-winning stage performer and former creative director of London’s famed Old Vic theater.

Spacey said in a Twitter post on Sunday that he was “beyond horrified” to learn of Rapp’s account of Spacey’s alleged seduction attempt, which Spacey said he did not recall. Spacey further wrote that he owed Rapp a “sincere apology” for what he said would have been “deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.”

A representative for Spacey did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

In an interview with BuzzFeed, Rapp, now 46, recounted attending a party hosted by Spacey in which the older actor picked him up, brought him to a bed and lay down on top of him after other guests had left.

According to Rapp, the young actor had the impression Spacey was drunk, pushed him away and left.

Spacey, who has won Oscars for the films “The Usual Suspects” and “American Beauty,” also said that Rapp’s story “had encouraged me to address other things in my life.”

“In my life I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I now choose to live life as a gay man,” Spacey wrote.

“I want to deal with this honestly and openly,” he said, “and that starts with me examining my own behavior.”

The actor for years had declined to publicly discuss his sexuality.

Rapp, who went on to star in the hit Broadway musical “Rent,” was starting his career on Broadway at the time of the alleged incident, appearing in a production of “Precious Sons” with Ed Harris and Judith Ivey. Spacey was then on stage with Jack Lemmon in a revival of the Eugene O‘Neill play “Long Day’s Journey Into Night.”

“He was trying to seduce me,” Rapp told BuzzFeed of the encounter with Spacey. “I don’t know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”

Rapp said on Twitter overnight that he had decided to come forward and tell his story, “standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out ... to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me.”

Everything he wanted to say about the experience had been covered in the interview, Rapp tweeted, adding that he had no further comment to make.

Some on social media expressed anger at Spacey’s conflation of an apology for sexual misconduct and a public acknowledgement of being gay.

Hollywood and some top U.S. companies have been rocked in recent weeks by allegations from scores of women that executives had sexually harassed or assaulted them.

American movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including some who said they were raped.

Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.

The chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, Dara Khosrowshahi, arrived in Brazil to lobby against the bill that is due to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday and which threatens the company’s business in a fast-growing foreign market.

Brazil is Uber’s third-largest market, with 17 million users, and the city of Sao Paulo sees more trips on the ride-hailing service than any other city in the world, ahead of New York and Mexico City, according to the company.

A spokesman for the company said the application as it exists could not operate under the new rules, including the use of a taxi license plate on cars owned by Uber drivers.

“The business model we have today would not longer be viable,” Uber’s executive spokesman in Brazil Fabio Sabba told Reuters.

Uber is already battling to keep operating in London after the city’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service and refused to renew its license.

Uber did not organize the drivers’ protests but alerted authorities that they would happen.

“The bill will create so much bureaucracy that it prevents the 500,000 drivers in Brazil from earning income for their families,” Uber said in a statement.

Uber said it has paid 495 million reais ($150 million) in federal and municipal taxes so far this year.

The bill, which has already been approved by the lower house of Congress, would define ride hailing applications as public transport instead of private services and require drivers to get a special permit from city authorities. It would also establish additional regulations and taxes.

If the Senate votes to approve the bill, it will be up to President Michel Temer to sign or veto the legislation or parts of it.

U.S. department stores have struggled with several quarters of declining sales and aggressive competition from off-price retailers as well as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

Macy’s has not found the right tools to bring more customers through its doors or improve its margins this holiday shopping season, and the company’s management has indicated they want balance sheet flexibility to weather a downturn, Citi analysts wrote in a research note.

ISS on Wednesday issued a report to guide institutional investors in a vote next week where the hedge fund manager hopes to win three ADP board seats. The proxy adviser recommended shareholders largely vote for the company’s slate but supported Ackman’s election.

Ackman’s filing, an usual criticism of a proxy adviser by an activist, came hours after the human resources outsourcing company’s board chair John Jones said in a letter to shareholders that ADP is not underperforming and plans to improve margins and profit further.

“ADP provided non-public, inaccurate and misleading information, claims, and arguments which were relied upon by ISS,” Ackman said in a regulatory filing made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

ADP and ISS had no immediate comment on Monday.

Ackman’s unveiled his stake of 8.3 percent, including 2 percent in common shares, in ADP in August, and has since criticized the company for what he calls sluggish earnings and inefficient operations. He plans to hold another investor webinar on Nov. 1.

“ISS accepted, and in its Report has publicly endorsed, certain misleading or incorrect factual assertions made by ADP management during its engagement with ISS,” Ackman said in the filing.

ISS said in its recommendation that shareholders should withhold their vote for ADP director Eric Fast to make room for Ackman but that the case was not “sufficiently compelling to justify replacing three directors.”

Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones last week both recommended all of Ackman’s directors.

Ackman took aim at the projection provided by ADP’s board chair on Wednesday, in which he said the company plans to improve its operating margin by 500 basis points between 2017 and 2020 and speed up its profit growth.

“This is a new and inaccurate disclosure that we believe is demonstrably false, and is intended to mislead shareholders and others about the lack of progress implied by ADP’s plan,” Ackman said in the filing.

Ackman also said that ISS failed to follow its own guidelines stating that it relies only on publicly disclosed information to reach its recommendations.

He flagged ADP’s labor productivity figures and the reference to an “upcoming release” of the Vantage 2.0 platform in the ISS report.

“The disclosure that ADP is close to releasing a Vantage 2.0 product offering for the Enterprise segment is material, even more so in the context of this proxy contest,” he said.",Ackman says ADP provided 'misleading' claims to ISS: filing,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-ackman-iss/ackman-says-adp-provided-misleading-claims-to-iss-filing-idUSKBN1CZ2BX

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that U.S. Special Operation Forces captured the militant in Libya in the past few days.

Two of the officials identified him as Mustafa al-Imam and said he had played a role in the attack and the ambassador’s death.

The officials said the man was now in the custody of the Department of Justice and being transported back to the United States by the military.

They added that the operation was authorized by President Donald Trump and had notified the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

Militants have exploited chaos following Muammar Gaddafi’s 2011 downfall.

Islamic State took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city.

Islamic State militants has shifted to desert valleys and inland hills southeast of Tripoli as they seek to exploit Libya’s political divisions after their defeat in Sirte.

The former president, who governed from 2010 to 2014, said he would pay for his proposals by cutting “unnecessary” government spending and simplifying the tax code to encourage investment and boost growth and the country’s coffers.

Recent opinion polls show Pinera, 67, with a wide lead over his seven rivals in the Nov. 19 first-round election. Pinera would also beat his two closest contenders, leftists Alejandro Guillier and Beatriz Sanchez, in a runoff if no candidate receives at least 50 percent of the vote, according to pollster CEP last week.

Guillier, the frontrunner on the left, has yet to put a pricetag on his proposals, which track the policies of outgoing center-left President Michelle Bachelet. Sanchez has proposed a $13.4 billion plan of deeper social and economic reforms, paid for in part by a tax on the “super-rich.”

The 67-year-old Pinera, a billionaire who has campaigned on a program of fiscal austerity, is benefiting from disenchantment with Bachelet, whose program of progressive reforms coincided with a downturn in the price of copper, which can account for as much as 15 percent of gross domestic product in Chile, the world’s top producer.

“Half of the financing for my program will come from reallocations drawn from ineffective government programs ... and a reduction of unnecessary spending in the public sector,” Pinera said in a 124-page paper detailing his proposals.

Pinera’s plan to reform the pension system would cost about $3 billion and include new subsidies to raise pensions for women and the middle class, as well as incentives to encourage workers to retire later, Pinera said in the document.

The current retirement system, introduced in the 1980s during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, was historically seen as a model by many economists, but it has been criticized in recent years on a number of fronts, including what many see as insufficient payouts.

A growing number of Canadians identifying themselves as indigenous, a higher fertility rate and a higher life expectancy for indigenous people than in the past help explain the rapid growth rate, Statistics Canada said.

Canada’s indigenous population grew 42.5 percent in the 10 years to 2016 to 1.7 million people, compared to 11 percent growth for Canada as a whole, Statistics Canada said, in data released from the 2016 census.

The findings show a young population, with an average age of 32.1 years, compared with 40.9 for the non-aboriginal population.

The census, which showed indigenous people accounting for nearly 5 percent of the population overall, also found a younger generation significantly more likely to be raised in foster care. Indigenous children made up 7.7 percent of all Canadians under 5 but more than half of the children were in foster homes, according to the census data.

The census also found that one fifth of the indigenous population lives in over-crowded housing, and 44 percent of indigenous people on reserves were living in homes that needed major repairs.

Last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada had failed its indigenous people. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Trudeau acknowledged the dark history of Canada’s colonization as one of “humiliation, neglect and abuse” and promised to do more.

Statistics Canada estimated that by 2036, indigenous people will comprise one-fifth of the populations of the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan - potentially giving them greater political clout.

Canada’s indigenous people come from hundreds of nations and bands, with more than 70 distinct languages. They include First Nations, Métis, people of mixed indigenous and European background, and Inuit, who largely inhabit Canada’s north.

Population growth between 2006 and 2016 was highest for Métis, at 51.2 percent. That appeared to result, at least in part, from more people calling themselves Métis rather than from a mushrooming Métis birth rate, Statistics Canada figures suggest.

In 2011, Métis women’s birth rate was just 12.5 percent higher than that of non-indigenous women.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

A previsão para o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) ficou, com isso, abaixo da expectativa do mercado de 2,5 por cento, conforme pesquisa Focus mais recente.

“Achamos que seria mais prudente elaborar Orçamento com previsão de PIB mais baixa, o que nos dá margem de segurança para trabalhar ao longo do próximo ano”, afirmou o ministro do Planejamento, Dyogo Oliveira.

Em coletiva de imprensa, ele também afirmou que uma revisão nesses parâmetros poderá ser feita mais adiante.

Apesar de o presidente da Câmara dos Deputados, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), ter criticado recentemente o envio de MPs pelo governo em detrimento de projetos de lei, o Executivo optou por esse formato para ganhar maior segurança na contabilização das receitas, já que MPs têm efeito imediato.

O ministro do Planejamento avaliou que o ambiente político para tramitação das medidas “sempre de convencimento”, mas adotou um tom de conciliação ao apontar que o Congresso tem toda a soberania para aprová-las ou não.

Serão duas MPs: uma para equiparar a tributação de fundos de investimento fechados com a que vale para os abertos, e outra que englobará a postergação do aumento salarial e a elevação da contribuição previdenciária do funcionalismo. Com a mudança para os fundos, o governo espera arrecadar 6 bilhões de reais líquidos para a União em 2018, receita que fará parte do Orçamento do próximo ano. Hoje, a incidência de Imposto de Renda para os fundos fechados ocorre apenas no fechamento ou resgate de cotas. Com a MP, o imposto será cobrado todos os anos, a exemplo do que ocorre com os demais fundos de investimento. Já com o adiamento em um ano do reajuste salarial do funcionalismo, o governo passou a prever economia de 4,4 bilhões de reais. Antes, a expectativa era de 5,1 bilhões de reais. Segundo Oliveira, a cifra menor reflete principalmente o impacto de contratação de servidores com a realização de concursos públicos no ano que vem. A elevação na contribuição previdenciária de servidores públicos de 11 para 14 por cento para o montante de remuneração que exceder o teto do Regime Geral de Previdência Pública (5.531 reais) deverá render ao governo 2,2 bilhões de reais em 2018, acima do montante de 1,9 bilhão de reais estimado antes.

OLHAR GERAL

Na mensagem modificativa do Orçamento de 2018 que foi enviada ao Congresso, o governo apontou receitas líquidas de 1,213 trilhão de reais e despesas totais de 1,372 trilhão, resultando no déficit primário de 159 bilhões previsto para o governo central (Tesouro Nacional, Banco Central e Previdência Social).

A meta foi afrouxada em 30 bilhões de reais em relação ao alvo anterior. Essa margem passou a comportar receitas adicionais de 14,5 bilhões e despesas de 44,5 bilhões, informou o ministério do Planejamento.

No lado das despesas, o Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC) recebeu forte injeção de recursos, com previsão de 25,92 bilhões de reais, contra apenas 1,97 bilhão de reais antes.

Do lado das receitas, o governo diminuiu em 600 milhões de reais a receita prevista com concessões em 2018, a 18,9 bilhões de reais.

Apesar de ter elevado a projeção de recebimento de recursos com a privatização da Eletrobras a 12,2 bilhões de reais, ante 7,5 bilhões antes, o governo excluiu a operação outrora prevista para o aeroporto de Congonhas, limando com isso 5,1 bilhões da conta de concessões.","Governo envia ao Congresso MPs para garantir Orçamento de 2018, mantém previsão de PIB",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CZ2MY-OBRBS

They may be even slower to close that gap if the laudable push for transparency is not backed up by the threat of eventual sanctions.

A City worker rests in the sun in London's Exchange Square March 13, 2007. REUTERS/Alessia Pierdomenico

The government in April gave organisations with at least 250 employees one year to disclose their gender wage gap. By mid-October, less than six months before the deadline, only 2 percent had done so. Extrapolating from such a small sample is difficult but it’s already clear that organisations where women both earn more than men on average and are overrepresented in the top pay quartile are rare. Yellow Dot, which runs nurseries, and The Commission for Equality and Human Rights are among the exceptions.

That tallies with statistics for the whole economy from the national statistics office, which show that men are on average paid nearly a fifth more than women even though the differential is at its narrowest on record. Women are more likely to be employed in low-paid sectors and rack up fewer hours at work. But even stripping out part-time work, the median hourly gap between male and female pay is 9.4 percent.

The idea is that transparency at company level will give women leverage to fight pay inequality. But Austria’s experience suggests otherwise. Its wage gap – one of the highest in Europe – has dropped just 2 percentage points to 21.7 percent since similar rules were introduced six years ago. First, it’s primarily highly-educated women seeking out the data. Second, few companies are doing much about their findings.

Granted, the British data will be published online rather than being held by internal work councils as in Austria. Media scrutiny and competition for the best talent might nudge companies to change. For example, an accounting graduate can now see that PwC offers higher mean wages and bonuses to female employees than rival Deloitte and promotes more women to top posts.

But closing the gender pay gap will also require changes to corporate cultures where men are more likely than women to climb the greasy pole. Governments are becoming more interventionist when companies pollute the environment or fail to pay enough taxes. Pay gaps may be another issue which may be fixed quickest by using sticks rather than carrots.",Breakingviews - UK gender pay equality drive is too easy to skirt,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-pay-breakingviews/breakingviews-uk-gender-pay-equality-drive-is-too-easy-to-skirt-idUSKBN1CZ1WL

(Reuters) - U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl took the stand at his sentencing on Monday, apologizing to the troops who got hurt searching for him after he deserted in Afghanistan in 2009 and detailing the harsh conditions of Taliban captivity.

“I made a horrible mistake,” the 31-year-old soldier said during his most extensive comments to date at North Carolina’s Fort Bragg. “Saying I’m sorry is not enough.”

His statements marked the opening of the defense’s case, which suffered a blow earlier in the day when the presiding military judge said President Donald Trump had not damaged Bergdahl’s chances of a fair sentence.

Trump called Bergdahl “a no-good traitor” who should be executed during last year’s presidential campaign, and the defense said more recent remarks by the Republican showed his opinion had not changed.

Army Colonel Jeffery Nance said Trump’s comments during the campaign were “condemning and damning of the accused” but had not influenced the proceedings.

“I am completely unaffected by any comments President Trump has made about Sergeant Bergdahl,” Nance said.

The judge said he would consider the president’s comments as a mitigating factor, however, raising the possibility of a lighter punishment for Bergdahl.

He faces up to life in prison after pleading guilty on Oct. 16 to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The Idaho native was captured by the Taliban after walking off his combat outpost in Paktika Province in June 2009 and spent the next five years in captivity suffering torture, abuse and neglect.

He was released in a 2014 Taliban prisoner swap brokered by the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama.

Bergdahl testified that his captors locked him in “the cage” after a brief escape. He got little food, water or sleep and was forced to watch beheading videos.

“Years of nothing but waiting to see if the next person to come in through the door would be the person to execute you,” he said.

Bergdahl said he knew his words would not take away the pain of those injured looking for him.

Master Sergeant Mark Allen, the most critically hurt, suffered a debilitating brain injury that left him unable to speak or walk after being shot in the head during a July 2009 mission.

His wife, Shannon Allen, was the final prosecution witness on Monday.

“Instead of being his wife, I‘m his caregiver,” she said. “Which doesn’t mean I love him any less, but it’s a very different dynamic.

O PLS 413/2017, de autoria do senador Eduardo Braga (PMDB-AM), foi apresentado em 26 de outubro no plenário do Senado e receberá emendas na Comissão de Constituição e Justiça até o fim desta semana.

O texto sugere alterar lei eleitoral de 1997 e tornar “crime a oferta, a contratação ou o uso de ferramenta automatizada que simule ou possa ser confundida com pessoa natural para gerar mensagens ou outras interações, pela internet ou por outras redes de comunicação, com o objetivo de influenciar o debate político ou de interferir no processo eleitoral.”

As penas sugeridas são de três a cinco anos de prisão e multa de até 100 mil reais.

U.S. department stores have struggled with several quarters of declining sales and aggressive competition from off-price retailers as well as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

Macy’s has not found the right tools to bring more customers through its doors or improve its margins this holiday shopping season, and the company’s management has indicated they want balance sheet flexibility to weather a downturn, Citi analysts wrote in a research note.

“We believe there is real risk that the dividend could be cut in the future in favor of paying down debt,” the analysts wrote.

Citi also slashed its target price on Macy’s shares to $16 from $21 and cut its rating to “sell” from “neutral.”

Macy’s declined to comment on the Citi report.

Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said in June that Macy’s full-year gross margin this year could be 60 to 80 basis points lower than in 2016.

The company, which also owns luxury chain Bloomingdale‘s, has been trying to turn itself around this year by closing underperforming stores, revamping its beauty business, building up its Backstage discount business and improving its e-commerce site.

Macy’s stock, which has lost about 45 percent of its value since the start of the year, was last down about 4.6 percent at $18.79 in afternoon trading.

Citi also downgraded its rating on J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) to “sell” from “neutral” and halved its target price on the stock to $1.50.

J.C. Penney had shed about a quarter of its market value on Friday as it slashed its full-year sales and earnings forecast after selling stagnant inventory at heavy discounts.

Shares in J.C. Penney were last down 9.5 percent at $2.82 on Monday, adding to losses from last week.

The chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, Dara Khosrowshahi, arrived in Brazil to lobby against the bill that is due to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday and which threatens the company’s business in a fast-growing foreign market.

Brazil is Uber’s third-largest market, with 17 million users, and the city of Sao Paulo sees more trips on the ride-hailing service than any other city in the world, ahead of New York and Mexico City, according to the company.

A spokesman for the company said the application as it exists could not operate under the new rules, including the use of a taxi license plate on cars owned by Uber drivers.

“The business model we have today would not longer be viable,” Uber’s executive spokesman in Brazil Fabio Sabba told Reuters.

Uber is already battling to keep operating in London after the city’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service and refused to renew its license.

Police said 800 Uber drivers drove through the center of Brazil’s capital Brasilia to protest the bill that many say will put them out of business. Similar protests in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro snarled downtown traffic.

Uber did not organize the drivers’ protests but alerted authorities that they would happen.

“The bill will create so much bureaucracy that it prevents the 500,000 drivers in Brazil from earning income for their families,” Uber said in a statement.

Uber said it has paid 495 million reais ($150 million) in federal and municipal taxes so far this year.

The bill, which has already been approved by the lower house of Congress, would define ride hailing applications as public transport instead of private services and require drivers to get a special permit from city authorities. It would also establish additional regulations and taxes.

If the Senate votes to approve the bill, it will be up to President Michel Temer to sign or veto the legislation or parts of it.

Hamilton became Britain’s most successful Formula One driver after clinching his fourth title in Mexico on Sunday.

Bookmakers William Hill have Hamilton as 15/8 favorite for the 2018 drivers championship, with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel at 3/1 and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen at 10/3.

Verstappen won Sunday’s race, the third triumph of the 20-year-old’s career.

Formula One has driver knights in Stirling Moss, generally regarded as the greatest never to win a championship, and triple world champion Jackie Stewart. Team principal Frank Williams and co-founder Patrick Head also have the honor.

Hamilton has the MBE, a lower rung of the multi-tiered British awards system, and went to Buckingham Palace to receive it from Queen Elizabeth.

When asked about the chances of a knighthood, the 32-year-old winner of 62 races said he had always wanted to go back to the palace.

“That would be the greatest honor, to firstly be invited back,” he said. “I try to represent England in the best way I can. If that at some stage is recognized by the Queen then I’d be incredibly honored.”

Hamilton wrapped the British flag around him as he celebrated on Sunday and has made much of his journey against the odds from an under-privileged background in the commuter town of Stevenage, north of London.

His paternal grandfather was an immigrant from the Caribbean island of Grenada.

“I wonder what the people who were at my school are thinking. There’s a couple of teachers who said you’re never going to amount to anything so I wonder what they’re thinking now,” he had mused on Sunday.

“I wonder if they’re thinking ‘I helped that young lad’. Or are they thinking ‘you know what, I regret what I said. And I’ve grown from it’? I hope that’s really the case.”

Olympic athletics gold medalist Mo Farah and Wimbledon winner Andy Murray are also sporting Sirs but the Scot has emphasized he still wants to be called by his first name.

Hamilton joked he would be the opposite, if such a situation ever happened.

“I would enforce it. To everyone. To friends, everyone. I think it’s such an honor,” he laughed. “I’ve got friends who are Sirs and I call them Sir. When I get a text, I‘m like ‘Yes Sir.’ It’s unique and why not live it in all its beauty?.”",Hamilton favorite for 2018 title and knighthood,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-motor-f1-mexico-hamilton-bets/hamilton-favourite-for-2018-title-and-knighthood-idUKKBN1CZ22A

The Cupertino-based company does not provide pre-order figures on iPhones, leaving investors and analysts in the dark in trying to track output through research with its suppliers, consumer surveys and other industry indicators.

But positive commentary from analysts on Monday signaled strong demand for the pricey device with pre-orders starting this past Friday.

Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results this Thursday. The company provides sales figures in its results.

Since the launch of new iPhones on Sept.12, the stock had fallen 2.5 percent until last Thursday’s close. They rebounded on Friday after Apple said pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were “off the charts”.

The stock climbed to $168.07 earlier in the session, adding nearly $26 billion to its market cap and inching it closer to becoming the first company with a trillion dollar valuation. Shares pared gains and were up 1.9 percent at $166.15 mid-day.

Daniel Ives, a well-known sector analyst, raised his forecast on Monday for pre-orders by 10 million, and several other analysts talked up sales over the next year.

In a note, Ives of research house GBH Insights, raised his pre-order demand expectations for the iPhone X to 50 million units from 40 million, calling the first stage of the iPhone X release a “stellar success”.

“With the official launch of iPhone X in Apple retail stores slated for this Friday, Nov. 3, we anticipate very high demand globally with limited supply of iPhone X on hand,” Ives said.

Jeffrey Kvaal from brokerage Nomura Instinet, said Apple and U.S. wireless carriers’ pushing out of delivery times for iPhone X orders to 5-6 weeks was longer than for previous phones and pointed to strong demand.

Asked by Reuters whether production bottlenecks are causing shipment delays, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth responded: “No, there’s no bottlenecks. This is a company that manages the supply chain well.”

However, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, cautioned that the longer wait times for consumers ordering phones may be as much due to the component supply issues, which led Apple to delay the launch of the premium phone until November.

“Although we believe Apple is benefiting from strong demand from the iPhone X, the company is also struggling with supply constraints,” White, who has a buy rating on Apple, said.

“A sound debate around the key driver for the surging shipping lead times can be made by reasonable people. Thus we believe it was important for Apple to highlight the demand side of the equation for the iPhone X.”

Wall Street is bullish on Apple with 31 of 38 brokerages rating the stock “buy” or higher. Their median price target of $180 projects a market cap of nearly $930 billion for the iPhone maker.",Apple touches record as brokerages bullish on iPhone X demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/apple-touches-record-as-brokerages-bullish-on-iphone-x-demand-idUKKBN1CZ21H

Millennials are responsible for much of the growth - 60 percent of that demographic spent money on Halloween in 2016.

The figures reflect a market that has rapidly expanded since the turn of the century - spending on Halloween products in the UK was just 12 million pounds in 2001, according to market research company YouGov.

A 2013 YouGov poll found that 74 percent of Britons said they would not be celebrating Halloween on Tuesday.

This hostility has long been documented in the country’s media, with newspaper columns like last week’s “Call me an old witch but I hate Halloween,” in London’s Evening Standard being a longstanding seasonal fixture.

Experts say that many Britons’ antipathy to Halloween was caused by a lack of historical attachment, as well as the view that it was an invasive cultural import from the United States.

“The Scottish version of Halloween was an old Celtic festival,” Hugh O‘Donnell, a professor of language and popular culture at Glasgow Caledonian University and author of a book about Halloween’s international appeal, told Reuters.

“England hasn’t been exposed to that kind of culture, the whole idea of Halloween is not only new, but their acquaintance of Halloween has not come from Scotland - it’s come from the United States.”

The lengthy queues building up outside some London costume emporia this year, as in recent years, attest to the event’s increasing acceptance in British popular culture.

“I never thought it could get any busier, but it literally got busier and busier and busier,” Andy Andreou, manager of London costume shop Angels, told Reuters with respect to the rise in Halloween trade over his 18 years of working there.

“The queues we have are ridiculous and people are happy to queue - I can’t tell you the enormity of it.”

Public relations manager Kyle Livingstone, at Angels to pick up a zombie costume, told Reuters that Halloween’s appeal was centered on “Just fun - it’s all about fun.”","From trick to treat: After years of antipathy, Britain embraces Halloween",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-halloween-day-britain/from-trick-to-treat-after-years-of-antipathy-britain-embraces-halloween-idUKKBN1CZ1TD

After scoring seven goals in as many league games, Lukaku has not scored in the following three matches and his fading goalscoring exploits along with his underwhelming record in big games has been criticised.

Mourinho reckoned Lukaku deserved more support after an assist in each of his last two league games, the most recent of which led to the winning goal in last Saturday’s 1-0 victory over third-placed Tottenham.

“I would like the supporters to explain to me why they don’t support him so much because he gives everything and I think it is not fair when scoring the goal or not scoring the goal (he) makes the whole difference,” Mourinho told the club’s website. (www.manutd.com)

“I don’t think it is fair at all. So, I‘m a bit disappointed - but not with him. With him (I am) very pleased.”

Mourinho’s decision to withdraw Marcus Rashford, rather than Lukaku, for Anthony Martial in the 70th minute against Spurs attracted loud boos from the Old Trafford faithful.

The Portuguese boss responded to critics by holding a finger to his lips after the final whistle but was puzzled by the fans’ dissent.

”I really don’t understand some reactions why,“ Mourinho added. ”Are they Red Devils? Sometimes I don’t know because they (Lukaku and Martial) work amazingly well.

“Sometimes he (Martial) starts the match and his contribution is good... the same as Rashford, the same as Lukaku.”

Mourinho said defender Marcos Rojo was likely to return from his long-term knee injury after the November international break but set no return date for midfielder Paul Pogba, who injured his hamstring last month.

In a board meeting at Japan’s SoftBank on Friday, several directors expressed doubts about giving up control of Sprint in any deal, the sources said, the latest twist in on-and-off talks to unite the two U.S. wireless carriers that began earlier this summer.

According to tentative deal terms that Reuters was first to report last month, SoftBank and other Sprint shareholders would have received close to 40 percent or a little more of the combined company.

The holdup in negotiations could torpedo plans to merge Sprint and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom, into a single carrier with more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N).

It could also damage the dealmaking credentials of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who has raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, and uses his image as a reliable counterparty to clinch deals.

If talks fall apart, it would be the second time an attempted merger of Sprint and T-Mobile has failed. The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014, but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

EXPLORING OPTIONS

Industry watchers had long expected Sprint and T-Mobile to attempt another deal, especially after a quiet period associated with a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves concluded in April, freeing up companies in the telecom industry to discuss mergers and acquisitions.

But no deal was announced immediately following the conclusion of the restriction on merger talks, and both Sprint and T-Mobile said they were open to exploring other options. A source told Reuters in July that SoftBank was considering an acquisition offer for Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) in a deal where it would combine the cable company with Sprint.

Sprint is in the middle of a turnaround plan and has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs. But industry analysts have expressed concern that the company, weighed down with total debt of $38 billion, has few financial options. Even though its customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by heavy discounting.

Sprint’s junk bonds were among the hardest hit in Monday afternoon trading, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters capital markets news service.

Claure said in August that while Sprint could sustain itself, cost savings from a transaction were significantly better than remaining a standalone entity. Analysts have estimated a deal could result in more than $30 billion in savings.

Sprint shares fell as much as 13 percent on Monday after Nikkei first reported that SoftBank was doubting the deal, and ended down 9.3 percent. T-Mobile shares ended down 5.4 percent.

Nikkei also reported that SoftBank would inform Germany’s Deutsche Telekom that it was calling off the deal talks, but sources who spoke to Reuters could not confirm this.

As of late Monday, T-Mobile still considered the negotiations with Sprint to be active, according to the sources.

Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank declined to comment.

DUE DILIGENCE ALMOST COMPLETE

The due diligence between T-Mobile and Sprint was almost complete as of last week, and the focus had shifted to working out a business plan for the combined company as well as an integration strategy, sources had told Reuters.

Even so, it was not clear that U.S. regulators would clear a deal between the two carriers.

Analysts have expected consolidation in the U.S. wireless industry to ease pricing pressure in the market, which could benefit AT&T and Verizon, who have lost share to their smaller rivals. Cable companies Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) are also entering the market with wireless service on Verizon’s airwaves.

“With no merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as the entrance of Comcast and Charter into wireless, we expect Verizon to have a difficult run going forward,” said Philip Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a research note. Verizon shares closed down 2.1 percent.

“Sprint as well could struggle to maintain positive subscriber momentum as cable enters, making its balance sheet look unsustainable.”

Shares in satellite television provider Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), which has been widely considered a potential partner for T-Mobile or Sprint because of its spectrum holdings, closed up 4 percent.","SoftBank, Deutsche Telekom hit wall in Sprint, T-Mobile talks: sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CZ265-OCABS

The Ottawa-based company, which provides software and back-end services to retailers, is expected to notch further sharp sales growth of roughly 67 percent versus a year ago but still no profit when it reports third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

Shopify’s founder and CEO Tobi Lutke has said he would use the company’s earnings call to respond to complaints from short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, which included criticism of payments to bloggers and others who get merchants to sign up to Shopify’s commerce platform. Left also called for the company to disclose the rate at which customers leave.

A spokeswoman declined to say what Shopify plans to disclose. One investor, who asked not to be named, said Lutke should not reveal “state secrets” just to squash Left’s criticism.

Left’s report earlier this month hit Shopify’s share price, but it has recovered somewhat, and not all investors agree with his analysis.

The Shopify shareholder, who declined to be identified discussing a holding, said the company could create a short squeeze by disclosing the average amount its roughly 2,500 high-end Shopify Plus members pay per month.

The minimum amount is $2,000, with additional charges due for those processing higher sales volumes.

But “they don’t need to give away state secrets just because of a self-interested short seller,” the shareholder added.

The company could also neutralize Left by, for example, telling investors how many of its more than 500,000 customers sell goods worth more than $100,000 a year, said Thomas Forte, a D.A. Davidson & Co analyst who has a neutral rating on the stock.

The company likely sees a high rate of merchants on its cheaper plans dropping off in their first year on the platform, several analysts said. But that number, known as churn, likely improves over time as successful businesses stick around.

“I’d love to have churn, I just don’t think we’ll get it,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan, who downgraded the stock to sector perform earlier this year on the basis of its red-hot valuation and a more subdued view on the likely timeline for new services to boost earnings.

Shopify’s U.S. shares trading on the New York Stock Exchange (SHOP.N) had roughly tripled in value this year, hitting a peak near $124 in September. But they fell below $90 in the wake of Left’s report and have partially recovered since, last trading at $107.

Despite Left’s attentions, the percentage of Shopify shares on loan to investors betting its price will fall has slipped since his report, to 3.66 percent of shares outstanding as of Oct. 12 versus 3.83 percent as of Sept. 28.

Since Left’s report, the company has made several announcements that boosted its image as a fast-growing tech darling, including plans to triple its headcount in Waterloo in the next couple of years - adding between 300 and 500 jobs to support Shopify Plus - and teaming up with DHL to provide international shipping for its small business customers.",Investors hope for details in Shopify's response to short seller,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CZ15E-OCATC

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

FILE PHOTO: An overall view of the assembly line where the BMW X4 is made at the BMW manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina March 28, 2014. REUTERS/Chris Keane/File Photo

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

Third quarter expenses for Europe’s biggest bank by market capitalization rose 7 percent, higher than analysts expected, as HSBC invested more in its retail banking and wealth management unit and paid out more in bonuses to staff.

The results highlighted the difficult path HSBC is walking between cost cutting and growth, as it seeks to increase income again following a period of wider restructuring after the 2008 global financial crisis.

HSBC earlier this month chose veteran John Flint as its next chief executive, with its newly arrived chairman promoting an insider to drive revenue growth. Flint will take over as CEO in February 2018.

With Flint, who spent much of his early career in Asia, and regional veteran Chairman Mark Tucker at the helm, analysts expect the London-based bank’s shift toward its second home market of Asia to accelerate.

“We’ve got good momentum, we’re seeing good investor appetite for new business coming through not only in Hong Kong but further afield in Asia,” Group Finance Director Iain Mackay told Reuters.

Pretax profit was $4.6 billion in the September quarter, up from $843 million in the same period a year ago, HSBC said in a stock exchange filing. The profit was roughly in-line with analyst estimates of $4.7 billion.

The year-ago profit was significantly impacted by a one-off loss of $1.7 billion from the sale of its Brazilian unit, and adverse foreign currency movements.

Reported pretax profit for the Asia operations, which account for 70 percent of the bank’s overall profits, rose 10 percent during the third quarter to $4 billion.

“Our international network continued to deliver strong growth ... and our pivot to Asia is driving higher returns and lending growth, particularly in Hong Kong,” HSBC Group Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said in the statement.

HSBC saw return on equity, a key measure of profitability, almost double to 8.2 percent in the first nine months of the year but it did not give a timeframe for achieving its long-term goal of 10 percent.

“We won’t achieve 10 percent by the end of 2017, but we are heading in the right direction,” Mackay said.

HSBC shares were down one percent in London at 1000 GMT, as investors reacted more to the lender’s surprise increase in costs than its better-than-expected profits.

PEARL RIVER PIVOT

HSBC has been able to boost its capital buffer despite rolling out share buybacks, the latest of up to $2 billion in July, and sustaining dividends, showing it is ahead on its turnaround strategy that includes expanding in Asia.

The bank makes more than half of its profits in Asia, and its regional pivot is centered around China’s Pearl River Delta region with billions in investment commitments and plans to bolster its retail and wealth management business.

Its customer base for retail banking and wealth management in mainland China had expanded by more than 70 percent so far this year, it said.

HSBC’s common equity tier 1 ratio - a measure of financial strength - was 14.6 percent at the end of September, slightly lower than 14.7 percent at end-June this year, but in-line with analyst expectations.

The ratio is set to increase in the medium term, as the bank repatriates about $8 billion stuck at its U.S. subsidiary, following approval last year from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

HSBC posted a 5 percent drop in adjusted revenue in fixed income, currencies and commodities business during the quarter. Some of its European rivals such as Barclays (BARC.L) saw the same business fall by more than 20 percent in the period.

The bank could end up moving fewer than 1000 jobs to Paris following Britain’s exit from the European Union, Mackay told reporters on a conference call, following previous remarks from senior bank executives suggesting that many roles would move.",Rising costs tarnish HSBC's Asia-driven profit growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/hsbc-results/asia-pivot-helps-hsbc-post-jump-in-q3-pretax-profit-idINKBN1CZ0BM

Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results this Thursday. The company provides sales figures in its results.

Since the launch of new iPhones on Sept.12, the stock had fallen 2.5 percent until last Thursday’s close. They rebounded on Friday after Apple said pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were “off the charts”.

The stock climbed to $168.07 earlier in the session, adding nearly $26 billion to its market cap and inching it closer to becoming the first company with a trillion dollar valuation. Shares pared gains and were up 1.9 percent at $166.15 mid-day.

Daniel Ives, a well-known sector analyst, raised his forecast on Monday for pre-orders by 10 million, and several other analysts talked up sales over the next year.

In a note, Ives of research house GBH Insights, raised his pre-order demand expectations for the iPhone X to 50 million units from 40 million, calling the first stage of the iPhone X release a “stellar success”.

“With the official launch of iPhone X in Apple retail stores slated for this Friday, Nov. 3, we anticipate very high demand globally with limited supply of iPhone X on hand,” Ives said.

Jeffrey Kvaal from brokerage Nomura Instinet, said Apple and U.S. wireless carriers’ pushing out of delivery times for iPhone X orders to 5-6 weeks was longer than for previous phones and pointed to strong demand.

Asked by Reuters whether production bottlenecks are causing shipment delays, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth responded: “No, there’s no bottlenecks. This is a company that manages the supply chain well.”

However, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, cautioned that the longer wait times for consumers ordering phones may be as much due to the component supply issues, which led Apple to delay the launch of the premium phone until November.

“Although we believe Apple is benefiting from strong demand from the iPhone X, the company is also struggling with supply constraints,” White, who has a buy rating on Apple, said.

“A sound debate around the key driver for the surging shipping lead times can be made by reasonable people. Thus we believe it was important for Apple to highlight the demand side of the equation for the iPhone X.”

Wall Street is bullish on Apple with 31 of 38 brokerages rating the stock “buy” or higher. Their median price target of $180 projects a market cap of nearly $930 billion for the iPhone maker.",Apple touches record as brokerages bullish on iPhone X demand,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/apple-touches-record-as-brokerages-bullish-on-iphone-x-demand-idUSKBN1CZ21H?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, was elected with 61.1 percent of the vote, the United Conservative Party announced at an event in Alberta’s largest city of Calgary.

Kenney will head a party formed this year from the Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties. It presents a serious challenge in the 2019 provincial election to the incumbent left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), which took power in 2015 helped partly by a divided right.

Alberta, where the Conservatives held power for 40 years before being ousted in a shock election by the NDP, is home to Canada’s vast oil sands and is the largest exporter of crude to the United States. But it has been struggling with a three-year slump in global oil prices and a C$10.3 billion ($8.24 billion) deficit.

Kenney has been eager to develop policies aimed at cutting costs for the oil and gas sector and is likely to be welcomed by the energy industry.

The deal also comes ahead of the widely anticipated move by Canada, to legalize cannabis for recreational use nationwide by July 2018.
Constellation said the deal also gives it the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in Canopy in the future.","(Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc (STZ.N) has bought a nearly 10 percent stake in Canadian cannabis maker Canopy Growth Corp (WEED.TO) for about C$245 million ($191 million), the first major wine, beer and spirits producer to invest in legal cannabis.

The move by the maker of Corona beer and Svedka vodka comes as Canada and a growing number of U.S. states move to legalize marijuana for recreational use, raising question marks over its illegal status at the U.S. Federal level.

Constellation said it had no plans to market cannabis or lobby for its legalization in the United States in the near future and analysts said the relatively small stake would allow it to take advantage of any future boom - or to exit if one does not materialize.

“One of the hallmarks of our success over the years has been our commitment to identify and stay ahead of early stage consumer trends,” the company said in a statement on the deal.

“This is another step in that direction,” it added.

Eight states, including California and Nevada, have legalized marijuana, already widely approved for medicinal use, for recreational use and some studies show consumers would buy the drug instead of alcohol if it was freely available.

A number of pharmaceutical companies have products that are cannabis derivatives and smaller investors have poured money into Canadian producers this year: the index of Canadian marijuana stocks calculated by research house Canaccord Genuity rose 36 percent in the month to Oct. 11.

But major firms in other sectors have kept their distance, worried by the connotations of involvement with a banned substance.

“We’re obviously trying to get first-mover advantage,” Constellation Chief Executive Rob Sands told the Wall Street Journal, adding that he expects cannabis to be legalized nationwide in the United States in coming years.

THREAT

Eight Capital analyst Daniel Pearlstein said that the move validated the cannabis industry as both a threat and opportunity for larger established companies in industries including alcohol and tobacco.

“This move is a complete game changer, not only for Canopy, but also for the entire industry,” he said.

Vivien Azer, an analyst at brokerage Cowen, said that data showed 18-25 year olds - a key market for spirit makers - perceived alcohol as increasingly risky compared with cannabis, for which risk perceptions have halved in a decade.

Industry watchers also say cannabis consumers have reduced their alcohol intake in U.S. states following legalization.

“We were ... able to show in our research in Colorado, Washington and Oregon that there has been a negative impact in alcohol consumption ... post the legalization of adult-use cannabis,” Azer said.

Analysts said a more immediate option for Constellation could be to develop non-alcoholic cannabis-infused beverages for the Canadian cannabis market, which consultants estimate could be worth around $5 billion to $10 billion.

The deal also comes ahead of the widely anticipated move by Canada, to legalize cannabis for recreational use nationwide by July 2018. The following year, edible and drinkable products are expected to become legal.

Canopy Growth is the biggest licensed producer of medical marijuana in Canada and is traded on the Toronto Stock exchange with a market capitalization of C$2.2 billion.

The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party made progress in talks on Monday and they will continue talking on Tuesday, the British government’s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said.

“In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to Parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed,” Brokenshire said in a statement.

“The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night,” he said, adding that the British government would consider “certain additional requests” made by the parties.

Brokenshire had earlier indicated that if there was no deal by the end of Monday it would move to pass an annual budget for the region to ensure essential services are funded.

A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, which observers have warned could destabilize a delicate political balance in the region.

The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province.

But Sinn Fein in January pulled out complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.

Talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP have stalled in recent weeks, in large part over proposals to improve the rights of Irish language speakers.

Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said the government could only be reformed “on the basis of equality, rights and respect”, which would require concessions from the DUP.

While the DUP also said it wanted to see the executive re-established, ahead of the talks it called for London to bring forward the budget “to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland”.

Neither party spoke to assembled media on the state of the talks on Monday evening.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

The mainly French-speaking province last week passed the law which does not specify which face coverings are prohibited but has largely focused debate on the niqab worn by some Muslim women, which covers everything but the eyes.

People affected by the law would include public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, hospital and daycare workers and those dealing with them.

Quebec’s Justice Minister Stephanie Vallee said the province wants to ensure accurate identification and better communication and public safety.

Vallee said women would have to remove their veils when necessary for identification but not for the entirety of a transit ride or other public service. She said no-one would be denied emergency medical care, even if they refused to unveil.

“These are common-sense rules,” Vallee told reporters in Quebec City.

Vallee’s remarks come amid continuing protests against the law, including from Muslim groups and rights advocates. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government has no place dictating what women wear but stopped short of saying Ottawa would challenge the law.

Vallee said those who refused to uncover their faces for religious reasons can apply for accommodation on religious grounds, although it was not immediately clear what that would entail.

Right-wing extremist groups and some local French-speaking media in recent years have targeted Quebec’s Muslims as part of a broader debate on the accommodation of religious and cultural minorities in the province.

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney-General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia’s secessionist government and called a snap regional election for Dec. 21, and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Monday’s calm on the streets of Barcelona resolved a weekend of uncertainty during which it was not clear how the region would respond to central control.

“THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON”

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started worked as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices though some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Two hundred thousand public sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and another 100,000 in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. This compared to 41.1 percent in July according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for sacked regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies who called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Trump and Republicans have vowed to enact tax reform this year for the first time since 1986. But the plan to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals faces challenges even from rank-and-file House Republicans.

House and Senate Republicans are on a fast-track to pass separate tax bills before the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, iron out differences in December, send a final version to Trump’s desk before January and ultimately hand the president his first major legislative victory. Analysts say there is a good chance the tax overhaul will be delayed until next year.

The NAHB, which boasts 130,000 member firms employing 9 million workers, says the bill would harm U.S. home prices by marginalizing the value of mortgage interest deductions as an incentive for buying homes. The trade group wants legislation to offer a tax credit equaling 12 percent of mortgage interest and property tax payments but says it was rebuffed by House Republican leaders.

“We’re opposed to the tax bill without the tax credit in there, and we’ll be working very aggressively to see it defeated,” NAHB chief executive Jerry Howard told Reuters.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the top House Republican on tax policy, suggested in a statement that the NAHB credit could still be included, saying: “I hope members of Congress will examine it closely to determine if they want it included.”

Republicans warned that the Trump tax plan is entering a new and difficult phase as lobbyists ramp up pressure on lawmakers to spare their pet tax breaks.

“When groups start rallying against things and they succeed, everything starts unraveling,” Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican fiscal hawk, told CBS’ Face the Nation.

ANXIETY IN HIGH-TAX STATES

One of the biggest challenges involves a proposal to eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), which analysts say would hit upper middle-class families in high income tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. The states are home to enough House Republicans to stymie legislation.

Brady gave ground over the weekend, saying he would allow a deduction for some local taxes to remain.

“We are restoring an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens,” Brady said in another statement.

But the gesture appeared to do little to turn the tide of opposition to SALT’s elimination.

“I‘m not going to sign onto anything until the full package is fully analyzed by economists,” Representative Peter King of New York told the Fox News program Sunday Morning Futures.

“The fact that we’re getting it at the eleventh hour raises real issues with me,” he added.

A lobby coalition representing state and local governments, realtors and public unions rejected Brady’s statement outright, saying the move would “unfairly penalize taxpayers in states that rely significantly on income taxes.”

House Republicans have also faced opposition from Trump and others after proposing to sharply curtail tax-free contributions to 401(k) programs and move retirement savings to a style of account that allows tax-free withdrawals, rather than the tax-exempt contributions that are popular with 401(k) investors.

House Republicans now say they could permit higher 401(k) contribution limits but continue to talk about tax-free withdrawals. “We will expand the amount that you can invest. But we’ll also give you an option to actually not be taxed later in life,” House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News.

The current cap on annual 401(k) tax-free contributions is $18,000.

Corker said congressional tax committees seem to be falling short of their goal to eliminate $4 trillion in tax breaks to prevent the Trump plan from adding to the federal deficit.

“They’re having great difficulty just getting to $3.6 trillion,” said the Tennessee Republican, who has vowed to vote against tax reform if it increases a federal debt load that stands at more than $20 trillion.

Ohio’s Republican governor, John Kasich, told Fox News Sunday that spending on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security should also be reviewed as part of the effort to pay for tax cuts.

“It may be separate from the tax bill, but it needs to happen,” Kasich said.",Trump tax overhaul under intensifying fire as Congress readies bill,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/trump-tax-overhaul-under-intensifying-fire-as-congress-readies-bill-idUSKBN1CY0ST?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Railway operator Deutsche Bahn continued to deal with “significant damage” from downed trees on some rail routes. Service will be limited in parts of northern Germany, DB said, after being suspended in large parts of the north and center of the country on Sunday, stranding thousands of travelers.

In the North Sea, authorities were monitoring the “Glory Amsterdam,” a 225-metre (742-foot) freighter that foundered 2.2 km (1.36 miles) from the German island of Langeoog, for any signs of oil leaks, said Michael Friedrich, spokesman for Germany’s Central Command for Maritime Emergencies.

But plans to tow the freighter free during high tide on Monday were being revised after officials determined the waters were too shallow for the ship that would have done the towing, Friedrich said. Instead, workers would seek to lighten the ship’s load and use ships with shallower draft for towing.

“We’re working on a plan, but the towing will definitely not happen today,” he said. The freighter’s captain had reported all was well on board and the ship’s crew of 22 was safe.

The freighter was not carrying any cargo, Friedrich said. Concern about an oil leak centered on 1,800 tonnes of heavy oil and 140 tonnes of marine diesel the ship had on board for fuel.

The non-profit environmental group World Wildlife Fund said the oil on board continued to pose a significant risk to the Wadden Sea, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and renewed its call for a worldwide ban on heavy oil for use as ship fuel.

The Wadden Sea is the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world. Including sand banks, salt marshes and dunes, it stretches from the Netherlands to neighboring Germany and Denmark.

“Numerous wading birds, ducks and geese that are resting there at the moment would be endangered by the oil” if the ship broke up, Hans-Ulrich Rosenberg, a mud flat expert with WWE, said in a statement.

A group representing German cutter and coastal fishermen questioned whether authorities had done enough to protect coastal areas. “This wasn’t exactly the storm of the century, which raises the question of whether the protections in place are sufficient,” said Dirk Sander, head of the group.

Elsewhere in Germany, Deutsche Bahn said rail traffic on a number of key routes - including the heavily traveled line from Hamburg to Berlin - would resume on Monday afternoon.

Thousands of travelers were stranded on Sunday, with some seeking shelter in special sleeping cars provided at stations. Trains that resumed service on Monday were crammed so full that some passengers had to disembark.",Germans seek to dislodge grounded freighter amid ecological fears,https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-weather/germans-seek-to-dislodge-grounded-freighter-amid-ecological-fears-idINKBN1CZ1T9?il=0

“But then I’m thinking, there’s a lot of life to live beyond 40.","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton says he plans to go out at the top but is not about to “do the easy thing” like former Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg who quit days after winning last year’s Formula One world championship.

Hamilton clinched his fourth title in Mexico with two races to spare on Sunday, becoming the most successful British driver of all time, but he reassured reporters that he was far from done.

“Four is a great number. But I want number five now,” declared the 32-year-old, who also races with the number 44 on his car.

”I want to go out at the top ... I could do the easy thing, like obviously Nico did, which is just stop and retreat with these four titles. But I think there’s more in me.

“I think there’s more to come, more of a challenge. There’s harder times ahead and I like that, I love that. That’s challenging and it would be so boring without it.”

Rosberg announced last December, days after securing his first title, that he was retiring after a career spent battling Hamilton.

The German, a family man, made clear he had been drained by the 2016 campaign and was not prepared to expend the same amount of physical and mental energy to defend a title that had been so hard to win.

Hamilton, who is developing interests outside of the sport in music, film and fashion, said he too had considered a change of scene but that was still some way down the road.

“I will continue to race while I love it, I’ve enjoyed it this year more than ever,” he said.

”I do think about how it would be so nice at some stage just to live in one place, a lot more socializing, walking your dogs every day or surfing.

“But then I’m thinking, there’s a lot of life to live beyond 40. There’s a lot to go.”

Next season will see two four times world champions, Hamilton and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, dueling on track with Red Bull’s 20-year-old Dutch star Max Verstappen -- the winner on Sunday -- leading a new generation.

McLaren’s double title-holder Fernando Alonso will also potentially be in a more competitive car.

“It’s kind of cool to be in this battle with him,” the Briton, who now has a record 72 pole positions and the second most wins (62) after Michael Schumacher (91), said of his new arch-rival Vettel.

“He got 50 poles yesterday (Saturday) and I’m like ‘Hmm, I don’t want to give him any more poles because he gets closer to me’. So I’ve got to keep on, act as inspiration to keep pushing it. Same with wins, same with championships.”

Hamilton, who is expected to agree a contract extension soon, said the fact that Vettel had signed for three more years with Ferrari, keeping him there until 2020, was also a source of motivation.

“I’m like:‘Ferrari are not going to like me for the next couple of years’,” he said.

“But it’s OK because we are going to make it as hard as it can possibly be for them to win championships. I really am looking forward to that battle with them.”","Motor racing: Four titles are great, but Hamilton wants more",https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1CZ0YR-OZASP

The $170 billion U.S. media firm was early and careful expanding beyond cable. Two examples are its purchase of NBC Universal - originally with its peacock logo - and a recently launched wireless phone service. Comcast stock has trounced the shares of Verizon Communications and AT&T. The company led by Brian Roberts has even pulled away from Walt Disney’s market value this year.

Thursday’s earnings report confirmed that Comcast lost 125,000 TV subscribers in the third quarter due to competition and hurricanes, something it warned about earlier.

That doesn’t detract much, though, from the longer-term picture. In 2004 Roberts, the chief executive, made a hostile lurch for Disney only to drop the bid. Comcast finally scored when it bought NBC Universal from General Electric in a two-part, $39 billion deal. The TV outfit’s former CEO, Bob Wright, groused in his book that GE, hobbled by the financial crisis, had given away the broadcaster for a song. He reckoned it was worth $45 billion.

AT&T has tried belatedly to follow. The telecom firm offered some $85 billion for HBO owner Time Warner in October last year and is still waiting for regulatory approval. It may have overpaid: Breakingviews calculated when the deal was announced that the expected $1 billion in cost savings won’t cover the hefty $20 billion premium.

Comcast is prudently moving into other areas as well. It launched a mobile service using Verizon’s infrastructure, avoiding acquiring a carrier like T-Mobile US. That may yet be an option, but for the moment it’s mostly upside for Comcast as it dips into the cellphone business.

Roberts has made mistakes. For one, he misjudged the political climate and had to drop a bid for Time Warner Cable, which Charter Communications scooped up. But investors have little to complain about. Since March 2013, when the NBC Universal deal was finally completed, Comcast’s total return, including dividends reinvested, of 96 percent beats the S&P 500 Index and Disney on around 80 percent each. AT&T and Verizon have managed only 15 percent and 26 percent, respectively.

His lavish lifestyle - with homes in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Hamptons, Arlington, Virginia and elsewhere - were detailed in an indictment filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that was revealed on Monday.

The indictment filed by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort “used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States.”

Prosecutors said they found payments by Manafort for four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz among transactions that they alleged came illegally from overseas to avoid paying U.S. income taxes, according to the 31-page court filing.

Prosecutors said they found evidence he bought a condo in a restored red-brick building in New York’s upscale Soho neighborhood for $2.85 million, also from overseas money, most often from Cyprus.

Manafort and associate Rick Gates pleaded not guilty on Monday to money laundering and other charges filed in a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Manafort and Gates both appeared stoic throughout a court hearing on Monday.

Greg Andres, a federal prosecutor on Mueller’s team, said his office had a “difficult time” trying to pin down Manafort’s and Gates’ net worths, making it hard to set appropriate bail arrangements.

Andres said Manafort listed a wide range of net asset values on loans and other financial documents, from as low as $20 million to as high as $100 million. Gates, meanwhile, listed assets as low as $2 million and as high as $30 million.

A federal judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates.

Manafort’s attorney Kevin Downing said on Monday there was no evidence that his client colluded with the Russian government while working for the Trump campaign. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment.

Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

The indictment said both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities.

The indictment said he spent $849,215 in a men’s clothing store in New York and $520,440 at one in Beverly Hills.

He spent $5,434,793 on a house in Water Mill, New York, in Long Island’s Hamptons, shelling out $820,240 for landscaping. Aerial photos of the place show gardens, a pool, a tennis court, a basketball court and a putting green and sand trap on 2.37 acres (0.96 hectare).

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

George Papadopoulos (3rd L) appears in a photograph released on Donald Trump's social media accounts with a headline stating that the scene was of his campaign's national security meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. on March 31, 2016 and published April 1, 2016. Social Media/Handout via REUTERS

George Papadopoulos, who joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016, lied in January about communicating with those individuals to arrange a meeting between then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said in the documents.

The documents said an unidentified campaign official advised Papadopoulos around May 2016 that Trump himself “is not doing these trips” but that “it should be someone low-level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.”

While not mentioned in the documents, top Trump campaign advisers, including Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Campaign Manager Paul Manafort met at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016 with Russians claiming to have derogatory information on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. It was not known whether that meeting resulted from Papadopoulos’ efforts.

The special counsel said Papadopoulos - a Chicago-based international energy lawyer - lied to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about when he learned from an unnamed foreign professor that Russia claimed to have “dirt” in the form of “thousands of emails” on Clinton.

Prosecutors said Papadopoulos told agents he had been in contact with the professor before he joined Trump’s campaign. In fact, they said, Papadopoulos met with the professor after joining the campaign.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Monday played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she told a news briefing. “Any actions that he took would have been on his own.”

Papadopoulos’ lawyers said in a statement it was “in the best interest of our client .... that we refrain from commenting on George’s case.”

The documents were released just after indictments charging Manafort and business associate Rick Gates with multiple offenses, including money laundering, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents.

None of the charges against Manafort and Gates, however, directly relate to Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and what U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Russian bid to boost Trump’s candidacy.

The prosecutors said Papadopoulos had been emailing with a “Campaign Supervisor,” “Senior Policy Adviser” and a “High-Ranking Campaign Official.”

An official familiar with congressional investigations into alleged contacts between the campaign and Russia said the Senate Intelligence Committee already had copies of an extensive file of Trump campaign emails that included emails between Papadopoulos and the campaign.

One email shows Manafort had been discussing Papadopoulos’ efforts to arrange a Trump visit to Russia with at least one other campaign official.

PLEA DEAL

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on Oct. 5, according to a court statement by Mueller’s office. As part of a plea deal, Papadopoulos agreed to plead guilty to making a “materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement” to FBI agents.

“Through his false statements and omissions, defendant Papadopoulos impeded the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the Campaign and the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,” a court document said.

The FBI arrested Papadopoulos on July 27 after he arrived at Dulles International Airport near Washington.

In an Oct. 5 letter to the Chicago man’s lawyer, Mueller and his team noted that Papadopoulos faced up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $9,500. But they agreed “to bring to the court’s attention at sentencing the defendant’s efforts to cooperate with the government” on condition that he continued providing information on to prosecutors, the document said.

Court documents said Papadopoulos lied to the FBI shortly after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, when the law enforcement agency had an open investigation into the alleged Russian government efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign.

In addition to lying about the timing of his contacts with the professor, prosecutors said Papadopoulos mischaracterized his contacts with that individual as “inconsequential.”

“In truth and in fact, however, defendant Papadopoulos understood the professor to have substantial connections to high-level Russian government officials and that the professor spoke with some of those officials in Moscow” before telling Papadopoulos about the “dirt” on Clinton, said the prosecutors.

The prosecutors said Papadopoulos also lied to the FBI in saying that a meeting the professor arranged for him in London with an unidentified Russian woman with ties to senior Russian officials occurred before the Chicago man joined the campaign.

The meeting took place on or about March 24, 2016, and the Russian woman was introduced to Papadopoulos as a relative of Putin, although it turned out that she was not related to the Russian leader, according to the documents.

Papadopoulos then worked with the professor and the Russian woman to set up the Putin meeting, and kept other Trump foreign policy advisers appraised of his contacts, they said.

In one email, the documents said, the Russian woman told Papadopoulos that ”The Russian Federation would love to welcome him (Trump) once his candidature would be officially announced.”

The prosecutors said that on or about March 31 Papadopoulos attended a “national security meeting” in Washington with then-candidate Trump and other campaign foreign policy advisers. When he introduced himself to the group, the prosecutors said, “he stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then candidate Trump and President Putin.”

In mid-April, the professor introduced Papadopoulos via an email to an individual in Moscow who the documents dubbed the Russian MFA Connection - MFA being the initials for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The pair had multiple conversations over the proceeding weeks about setting the “groundwork” for a Trump-Putin meeting.",Former Trump adviser Papadopoulos pleads guilty to lying to FBI,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-papadopolous/former-trump-adviser-papadopoulos-pleads-guilty-to-lying-to-fbi-idUSKBN1CZ1RJ?il=0

Podesta Group filed lobbying disclosures with the Department of Justice in April and August saying it did work in 2012 for the same pro-Russian Ukrainian group for which Manafort had worked. Podesta Group work alongside another Washington lobbying firm, Mercury LLC, which also said on Monday that it was cooperating with Mueller’s team.

No charges were filed against anyone with Podesta Group or Mercury.

Tony Podesta did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Podesta was the head of the firm that bore his name. It did $10.7 million in lobbying in the first nine months of 2017, according to disclosures the firm filed with the U.S. Congress.

He is the brother of John Podesta, who served as chairman of the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and as a senior White House adviser to Democratic former President Barack Obama.

Mueller’s team has been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign, but neither Trump nor the campaign were mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates.

While Podesta Group is seen as a mainly Democratic lobbying firm, Mercury is viewed as mainly a Republican shop. Mercury is a subsidiary of Omnicom Group and does public relations work in addition to lobbying. Omnicom did not reply to a request for comment.

Podesta is listed as a lobbyist on several of the firm’s largest accounts including Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Wal-Mart, Textron and General Dynamics.

O maior banco privado do país anunciou nesta segunda-feira que seu lucro recorrente do período somou 6,254 bilhões de reais, alta de 11,8 por cento sobre um ano antes e de 1,4 por cento na comparação seqüencial. Em termos líquidos, o lucro somou 6,077 bilhões de reais, alta de 1,05 por cento sobre o trimestre imediatamente anterior e de 12,66 por cento ano a ano.

A despesa com provisão para calotes desabou 30,6 por cento na comparação anual.

O índice de inadimplência, medido pelo saldo de operações vencidas com mais de 90 dias em relação à carteira total, ficou em 3,2 por cento, estável sobre o trimestre anterior e com queda de 0,7 ponto percentual contra mesmo intervalo do ano passado.

Por fim, o Itaú Unibanco teve queda de 4,5 por cento das despesas administrativas, a 11,82 bilhões de reais, movimento puxado sobretudo pelo recuo de 14,4 por cento das despesas de pessoal.

Com isso, o banco conseguiu compensar o novo declínio na carteira de crédito. O estoque de empréstimos, incluindo garantias e títulos privados, fechou junho em 575,2 bilhões de reais, queda de 1,3 por cento em três meses e de 4,4 por cento sobre o fim do primeiro trimestre de 2016.

A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday.

It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.

Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges against them in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday.

The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies.

Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office.

Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine.

The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.

A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.

“We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing.

Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign.

Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said the charges against Manafort could put pressure on him to cooperate with the Russia investigation.

”If I were the defense lawyer, I’d be looking into cooperating,” he said.

In a development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.

Mueller’s office said Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain which stated that he has since “met with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document.

White House spokeswoman Sanders played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election, by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Clinton.

Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

Trump on Monday reiterated his frustration with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” Moscow also denies the allegations.

“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton.

Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.

Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities, the indictment said.

They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said.

The indictment said Manafort owned properties in Manhattan; Brooklyn; the Hamptons; Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Prosecutors said Manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. They also said he had been making payments on four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.

Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman.

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for the Trump administration to avoid interfering with Mueller’s probe.

“The rule of law is paramount in America and the investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded. The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” Schumer said.","Two ex-Trump aides charged in Russia probe, third pleads guilty",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-charges-indictment/two-ex-trump-aides-charged-in-russia-probe-third-pleads-guilty-idUSKBN1CZ1KT

“His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,” Mujahid said in a statement.

“We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” he said.

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that U.S. Special Operation Forces captured the militant in Libya in the past few days.

Two of the officials identified him as Mustafa al-Imam and said he had played a role in the attack and the ambassador’s death.

The officials said the man was now in the custody of the Department of Justice and being transported back to the United States by the military.

They added that the operation was authorized by President Donald Trump and had notified the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

Militants have exploited chaos following Muammar Gaddafi’s 2011 downfall.

Islamic State took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city.

The cafes with European names and bright decor seem a world away from the city’s traffic-clogged and still violent streets. In a socially conservative society, they also offer privacy and protection from unwanted advances.

“If I go with my friends, we chat about our problems and change our mood,” said 27-year-old Haneen, eating a late breakfast in the busy La Rambla cafe. “A family place is more comfortable ... there’s no harassment or flirting.”

For owners and managers of the businesses marketing themselves as “families-only” cafes, it’s also a welcome change from the traditional clientele - hundreds of other rowdier eateries across Tripoli are packed out with young men, tables spilling out onto the streets and giant screens broadcasting soccer matches.

“Family cafes are great,” said Abdulhameed Ghreetly, manager of At Home cafe, which looks out onto the Mediterranean. “They are less of a headache than the cafes for young guys. You know the problems with the young guys and their quarrelling.”

Most of Tripoli’s economy has been in freefall since major battles between rival factions in 2014 left the country divided with competing governments.

The female clients are offering some respite - managers say they spend more on fancy coffees and juices than the espresso-sipping men.

“THE WOMEN COME TO EAT”

“The guys just ask for coffee and water,” said Mohamed Abdurrazak, La Rambla’s owner. “The women come to eat.”

Women sit at a cafe on a beach in Tripoli, Libya October 28, 2017. Picture taken October 28, 2017. REUTERS/Hani Amara

The menus are heavy with pastries, pancakes, waffles and milkshakes, along side the popular “Oriental breakfast” which includes shakshouka (poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce) and ful (fava beans with herbs and spices).

Prices are higher, too. A coffee in a regular cafe costs two Libyan dinars ($1.50 at the official exchange rate, 25 cents at black market rates), and five or six dinars in a family cafe.

The new businesses are also flourishing in Benghazi, Libya’s second city, which suffered heavy damage during more than three years of fighting. Customers come to relieve the daily stress, said Saad al-Farjani, the owner of the Coffee Factory.

“All the time you hear of new family cafes opening. There are about 20 and there could be more.”

Some see the cafes as heralding a return to relative normality – their owners say they have had little trouble from armed groups known for extortion and theft. Upmarket shops, some with international brands, have opened in smarter neighborhoods.

Opinion is split on what the cafes say about Libyan society.

For some they are a sign of increasing openness – Libyan women have little chance to socialize outside the home.

For others they are a reminder of the limits on women in a country where outdoor public spaces are dominated by men.

“I consider coming to the cafe like traveling, a change of atmosphere,” said Ghada Mohamed, a 37-year-old customer at Coffee Factory. “I hope that cafes ... become like cafes abroad, for example, with seats outside. Unfortunately in Benghazi we cannot sit outside enough.”",Women find some respite in Libya's 'families only' cafes,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-libya-life-cafes/women-find-some-respite-in-libyas-families-only-cafes-idUKKBN1CZ1JN

Late on Friday, Merck withdrew an application for European use of its flagship drug Keytruda as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy, raising questions about future sales.

The Keytruda/chemo combination is already approved in the United States based on initial promising data. But the company determined that a similar European first-line approval without more mature late-stage data was unlikely.

Lung cancer is by far the most lucrative oncology market with first-line approval providing access to the most patients.

In the wake of the news, at least three analysts cut their ratings on Merck's stock, a component of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, while other analysts lowered their target prices for the stock.

“We are downgrading MRK shares to Equal Weight from Overweight based on diminished upside potential from Keytruda, which is by far Merck’s biggest value driver,” Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said in his downgrade note.

Aside from the European withdrawal, Meacham and other analysts also cited delays for another Keytruda study, revealed on Friday morning. Merck said a decision to make overall survival a main goal for a large, pivotal lung cancer trial of Keytruda plus chemotherapy would delay those results until February 2019.

Merck shares fell 5.6 percent to $54.95 on Monday, touching their lowest point since May 2016. The stock had dropped 6 percent on Friday following the company’s third-quarter results.

The drugmaker said that the cost of a June cyber attack that temporarily crippled manufacturing coupled with lower sales of off-patent products caused its third-quarter revenue to fall 2 percent to $10.33 billion, even as Keytruda sales topped $1 billion for the first time.

The combined, roughly 11-percent two-day decline for Merck shares would be the biggest since February 2009.

Merck’s setback boosted shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), which sells a rival cancer therapy. Bristol-Myers shares were up 1.6 percent.

Pharmaceutical stocks have endured a rocky month so far as earnings results have poured in. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index .DRG is down 2 percent in October against a 2.1 percent rise for the overall S&P 500 .SPX.

The multi-party Democratic Unity coalition has had a tough 2017, first failing to bring down Maduro in four months of protests that led to 125 deaths, then losing surprisingly to the Socialist Party in a gubernatorial election earlier this month.

That has left the opposition weakened and divided, and Maduro strengthened, despite growing foreign pressure on his government over alleged rights abuses and corruption, and an unprecedented economic crisis that has millions skipping food.

Three heavyweight movements in the opposition - Justice First, Popular Will and Democratic Action - announced on Monday they did not trust the government-leaning election board sufficiently to participate in the municipal polls in December.

Justice First leader Julio Borges, who also heads the opposition-led congress, said authorities cheated in the 2013 presidential election, denied Venezuelans a recall referendum last year, and rigged the Oct. 15 gubernatorial vote.

So instead of going into another “manipulated” vote, the opposition should focus on demanding reforms to the election board in anticipation of next year’s presidential poll, he said.

“The objective remains getting Nicolas Maduro out of power, and in this struggle, the world is with us,” he told reporters.

To the surprise of some, the Democratic Action party also joined the boycott. Its candidates won four governorships in October’s vote and then infuriated many opposition supporters by swearing loyalty to a pro-Maduro legislative superbody.

Opposition supporters have been split over participating in elections this year. Some say it is the only way to show they are a majority and undermine Maduro, while a growing number argue there is no point in fighting a “dictator” via a system rigged in his favor.

They are pinning their hopes on international action, including U.S. sanctions against Maduro’s government.

Maduro, whose personal popularity has plunged since his 2013 election due to food shortages and runaway inflation, said “sabotage” and “insurrection” were being planned against the mayoral votes.

“I declare myself in battle,” the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez said in a meeting with governors on Monday.

“Those who attack the election system must pay.”

Opposition leaders say the government has long been rigging elections by gross abuse of state funds in favor of socialist candidates, and dirty tricks such the last-minute moving of vote centers in opposition areas for the October ballot.

They have also presented some allegations of ballot-rigging.

However, Maduro insists Venezuela’s system is entirely trustworthy and impossible to hack. It has received international praise in the past, although it was slammed over July’s vote for the Constituent Assembly superbody.

Maduro says the street protests earlier this year were a mask for a U.S.-backed coup plot, and accuses opponents of wanting to oust him by undemocratic means.

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday.

It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.

Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges against them in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday.

The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies.

Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office.

Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine.

The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.

A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.

“We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing.

Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign.

Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said the charges against Manafort could put pressure on him to cooperate with the Russia investigation.

”If I were the defense lawyer, I’d be looking into cooperating,” he said.

In a development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.

Mueller’s office said Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain which stated that he has since “met with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document.

White House spokeswoman Sanders played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election, by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Clinton.

Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

Trump on Monday reiterated his frustration with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” Moscow also denies the allegations.

“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton.

Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.

Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities, the indictment said.

They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said.

The indictment said Manafort owned properties in Manhattan; Brooklyn; the Hamptons; Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Prosecutors said Manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. They also said he had been making payments on four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.

Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman.

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for the Trump administration to avoid interfering with Mueller’s probe.

“The rule of law is paramount in America and the investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded. The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” Schumer said.","Two ex-Trump aides charged in Russia probe, third pleads guilty",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-charges-indictment/two-ex-trump-aides-charged-in-russia-probe-third-pleads-guilty-idUSKBN1CZ1KT?il=0

New York, 30. Okt (Reuters) - Die angedachte milliardenschwere Mobilfunk-Hochzeit der amerikanischen Telekom-Tochter T-Mobile US mit dem Rivalen Sprint ist einem Zeitungsbericht zufolge vom Tisch. Es gebe Uneinigkeit über die künftigen Eigentumsverhältnisse und der Sprint-Großaktionär Softbank werde der Telekom daher vielleicht schon am Dienstag einen Abbruch der Verhandlungen vorschlagen, berichtete das japanische Wirtschaftsblatt Nikkei am Montag. Insider sagten der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters indes, die Verhandlungen seien nicht geplatzt. T-Mobile US wolle die Gespräche vielmehr weiterführen.

T-Mobile US und Sprint sind die Nummer drei und vier auf dem US-Mobilfunkmarkt und haben einen gemeinsamen Börsenwert von rund 80 Milliarden Dollar. Seit Wochen wurde in Medien über Fortschritte bei den Fusionsverhandlungen berichtet. Der neue Konzern hätte 130 Millionen Kunden und einen Umsatz von geschätzt mehr als 70 Milliarden Dollar. Er könnte in den USA dann besser mit den Platzhirschen Verizon und AT&T konkurrieren.

Nikkei zufolge hat die Deutsche Telekom darauf bestanden, eine Kontrollmehrheit an dem fusionierten Unternehmen zu halten. Der Softbank-Verwaltungsrat habe aber am Freitag entschieden, die Kontrolle nicht abgeben zu wollen. Die Softbank-Direktoren würden vielmehr hinterfragen, war für Vorzüge sie bei einer Abgabe der Kontrolle hätten.

Insider sagten Reuters lediglich, das Softbank-Gremium überdenke die Fusions-Überlegungen, da man die Kontrolle über Sprint nicht abgeben wolle. In Medienberichten hatte es zuletzt geheißen, Softbank und die anderen Sprint-Anteilseigner würden wohl 40 Prozent an dem neuen Unternehmen halten, entschieden sei aber noch nichts. Ende September, als Insider über einem nahen Durchbruch berichteten, hatte T-Mobile US einen Börsenwert von 52 und Sprint von 32 Milliarden Dollar.

Aktien von T-Mobile US gaben in Folge des Nikkei-Berichts an den US-Börsen mehr als fünf Prozent nach, Sprint büßten sogar elf Prozent ein. Papiere der Deutschen Telekom verloren im späten Frankfurter Handel 1,3 Prozent.

SoftBank, Sprint und T-Mobile waren für Stellungsnahmen zunächst nicht zu erreichen. Die Deutsche Telekom wollte sich nicht äußern. Schon 2014 hatte es einen Anlauf für eine solche Fusion gegeben. Dieser scheiterte aber an den Wettbewerbshütern.

FILE PHOTO: Chevrolet Cruze chassis move along the assembly line at the General Motors Cruze assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk/File Photo

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Um terceiro ex-assessor de Trump, George Papadopoulos, se declarou culpado em outubro por mentir ao FBI, segundo anúncio nesta segunda-feira.

As acusações foram uma escalada acentuada da investigação de cinco meses do conselheiro especial do Departamento de Justiça dos Estados Unidos, Robert Mueller, sobre supostos esforços russos para inclinar a eleição em favor de Trump e sobre possível conluio de assessores de Trump.

Manafort, de 68 anos e há tempos operador republicano, e Gates foram indiciados em um tribunal federal em Washington.

Ambos se declararam inocentes para uma série de incriminações em uma acusação formal de 12 crimes, indo de lavagem de dinheiro a atuação como agentes não registrados do ex-governo pró-Rússia da Ucrânia.

O tribunal colocou ambos sob prisão domiciliar. Haverá outra audiência na quinta-feira.

A investigação de Mueller e outras apurações feitas por comitês do Congresso sobre supostos esforços russos para influenciar a eleição criaram uma sombra sobre os primeiros nove meses do presidente republicano no poder.

Trump e sua campanha não foram mencionados na acusação contra a dupla. Muitas das acusações, algumas voltando para mais de uma década, têm a ver com o trabalho de Manafort para a Ucrânia, em vez da campanha de Trump.

Uma porta-voz da Casa Branca disse que o indiciamento não tem a ver com Trump ou sua campanha e que não mostrou evidências de conluio entre a campanha e a Rússia.

“Nós temos dito desde o primeiro dia que não há evidência de conluio entre Trump e Rússia, e nada na acusação de hoje muda isto”, disse a porta-voz Sarah Sanders durante entrevista coletiva.

As acusações contra Manafort podem pressioná-lo a cooperar com a investigação de Mueller sobre a Rússia, disse Renato Mariotti, ex-procurador federal em Chicago.

“Se eu fosse o advogado da defesa, eu estaria analisando cooperar”, afirmou.

CULPADO

Em um desenvolvimento diretamente relacionado à campanha eleitoral de Trump de 2016, foi anunciado nesta segunda-feira que Papadopoulos, um ex-assessor de campanha, se declarou culpado neste mês de fazer falsas declarações ao FBI.

O escritório de Mueller disse que Papadopoulos mentiu para agentes do FBI sobre o momento do contato entre ele e um professor em Londres que afirmou ter informações que prejudicariam a candidata democrata à Presidência Hillary Clinton.

L‘indice Dow Jones a cédé 0,36%, soit 85,45 points, à 23.348,74. Le S&P-500, plus large, a perdu 8,24 points, soit 0,32%, à 2.572,83. Le Nasdaq Composite a reculé de son côté de 2,30 points (-0,03%) à 6.698,96.

Les deux premiers indices, qui sont sur une série de sept hausses hebdomadaires de suite, restent cependant tout près de leurs records. A un jour de la fin du mois d‘octobre, ils sont bien partis pour afficher leur meilleure performance mensuelle depuis février.

Fin septembre, le président Donald Trump a présenté un projet de réforme fiscale prévoyant notamment un taux d‘impôt sur les sociétés ramené de 35% à 20%.

Cependant, certains signes ont dernièrement suggéré que l‘administration Trump ne disposait que d‘une faible marge de manoeuvre pour faire aboutir ce projet malgré la majorité que détiennent les républicains au Congrès.

L‘agence Bloomberg a jeté un froid parmi les investisseurs en disant dans la journée que l‘objectif de 20% ne serait atteint qu‘en 2022, le taux actuel ne devant être réduit que de trois points l‘année prochaine.

“Beaucoup d‘acteurs de marché voient cette baisse des impôts comme le nouveau moteur de la hausse des actions”, a dit Rick Meckler, président de LibertyView Capital Management.

Les investisseurs ne semblent en revanche guère s‘émouvoir du fait que Paul Manafort, ancien directeur de campagne de Donald Trump, et son associé Rick Gates ont été inculpés de douze chefs d‘accusation, dont conspiration contre les Etats-Unis et blanchiment d‘argent.

Le dollar a reculé de plus de 0,4% face à un panier de devises internationales, pénalisé par les spéculations donnant Jerome Powell, actuel gouverneur de la Réserve fédérale, comme le favori pour succéder à Janet Yellen à la présidence de la banque centrale américaine.

Le repli du billet vert a contribué à la poursuite de la hausse des cours du pétrole, qui restent surtout soutenus par la perspective d‘une nouvelle prolongation de l‘accord mondial de réduction de la production.

Sur le marché obligataire, le prix des emprunts du Trésor à 10 ans a augmenté de 0,5%, signe d‘une certaine prudence des investisseurs à l‘entame d‘une semaine chargée en termes de politique monétaire, avec les réunions de la Banque du Japon (mardi), de la Fed (mercredi) et de la Banque centrale européenne (BCE) (jeudi).

A l‘autre bout du spectre, Mattel a gagné 11,29% à 15,58 dollars, signant la plus forte hausse du S&P 500, refaisant le terrain perdu vendredi (-8,91%) suite à l‘annonce par le fabricant de jouets qu‘il suspendait le versement de son dividende trimestriel.

“War is fundamentally unpredictable,” Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told a Senate hearing about a potential new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, Congress’ most significant step in years toward taking back control of its constitutional right to authorize war.

Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson both said existing authorizations should not be repealed until new ones are in place, and stressed that they believe current AUMFs provide sufficient legal authority for ongoing military action.

“The 2001 AUMF provides statutory authority for ongoing U.S. military operations against al-Qaeda; the Taliban; and associated forces, including against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,” Tillerson said in his opening statement.

Republican and Democratic members of Congress have been arguing for years that Congress ceded too much authority over the deployment of U.S. forces to the White House after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. They are also divided over how much control they should exert over the Pentagon. Repeated efforts to write and pass a new AUMF have failed.

Under the Constitution, Congress, not the president, has the right to declare war.

Concerns intensified this month after four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger and previously over Trump’s talk about dealing with North Korea and an April attack on an airfield in Syria.

Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the foreign relations committee, told the hearing the ambush in Niger shows that U.S. forces “can find themselves in combat at any moment.”

‘GLOBAL, ENDLESS, SHADOW WAR’

Congress has not passed an AUMF since the 2002 measure authorizing the Iraq War. But the legal justification for most military action for the past 16 years is the older authorization passed days after the Sept. 11 attacks, for the campaign against al Qaeda and affiliates.

Backers of a new AUMF say the 2001 authorization has let presidents wage war wherever they like, without spelling out any strategy for Congress, or the public. For example, Islamic State did not exist when the 2001 AUMF was passed.

“I do not think the American people want the United States conducting a global, endless ‘Shadow War,’ under-the-radar, covert and beyond scrutiny,” said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel.

Mattis told the hearing he was not averse to a new authorization.

“Any new congressional expression of unity, whether or not an AUMF, would present a strong statement to the world of America’s determination,” he said in his opening statement.

But he said imposing limits would help America’s adversaries.

“We are more likely to end this fight sooner if we don’t tell our adversary the day we intend to stop fighting,” Mattis said.

Trump’s fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives but there are deep divisions over any possible new authorization within the party, as well as between Republicans and Democrats.

Many more hawkish Republicans do not want a measure exerting too much control over the Pentagon and say military commanders should decide how to fight America’s enemies.

After sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted hundreds of thousands of women and men to share stories about inappropriate behavior, Britain’s parliament - a bastion of tradition - has been no exception.

Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered an investigation into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys and the opposition Labour Party has suspended one of its lawmakers while it looks into his comments and behavior.

The growing scandal could damage May if there are further allegations against members of her Conservative Party as it relies on a small Northern Irish party for a majority in parliament.

On Monday, May made a rare appearance in parliament to sit beside leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom as she set out the government’s plans to tackle sexual harassment, including measures to enforce a code of conduct and to set up an independent grievance procedure.

“We absolutely are determined to get a grip on this,” Leadsom told parliament, outlining government plans for a “zero-tolerance” approach.

But critics said measures should go further and tackle the culture in parliament, where some female politicians said power was concentrated in lawmakers’ hands and wielded often unchecked over more junior workers.

“There is obviously a problem, it’s a good thing that it’s been exposed,” Labour lawmaker Harriet Harman said. “No one should have to work in the toxic atmosphere of sleazy sexist or homophobic banter.”

THE LIST

The allegations against Weinstein - who denies all accusations of non-consensual sex - has prompted discussion of sexual harassment around the world.

Last week, Labour lawmaker Jared O‘Mara was suspended for reportedly making slurs against a woman he dated and other comments, and at the weekend, Mark Garnier, a junior trade minister, was reported by the Mail on Sunday newspaper to have asked his secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy sex toys and called her “sugar tits”.

On Sunday, May ordered an investigation and wrote to the speaker for advice on changing the culture in parliament, where aides, researchers and secretaries are dependent on their employers, the lawmakers.

“She is deeply concerned at the recent media reports regarding the alleged mistreatment of staff by some members of parliament,” May’s spokesman told reporters.

“She has been clear that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable in any walk of life and she strongly believes it’s important that those working in parliament are treated properly and fairly.”

But in a sign the scandal may widen, British media carried unconfirmed reports that parliamentary aides have drawn up a list of other allegations of inappropriate behavior in parliament. The list could not be confirmed by Reuters.

Xi was speaking to business leaders and officials at the meeting, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) reported. Cook and Zuckerberg are on the advisory board of the Tsinghua School of Economics and Management.

The meeting comes at a particularly key time for Apple as it prepares to launch its much-anticipated iPhone X on Friday, amid hopes the anniversary smartphone can revive the firm’s sales in the world’s number two economy.

Tsinghua’s business school, founded in 1984, has seen scores of top Chinese and foreign industry leaders sit on its board, including Chinese central banker Zhou Xiaochuan and Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein.

Facebook’s Zuckerberg has also been very active in China, eager to get his popular social network unblocked in the world’s most populous nation, where it has been banned since 2009 and held behind the country’s so-called Great Firewall.

An Apple spokeswoman said the firm couldn’t “comment on Tim’s schedule and or meetings”. Facebook confirmed Zuckerberg was in Beijng, but declined to comment on details of his visit.

In a post on his Facebook page on Saturday, Zuckerberg wrote he was in Beijing for the annual meeting. “Every year this trip is a great way to keep up with the pace of innovation and entrepreneurship in China,” he said.","Apple's Cook, Facebook's Zuckerberg meet China's Xi in Beijing",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tech/apples-cook-facebooks-zuckerberg-meet-chinas-xi-in-beijing-idUSKBN1CZ1NP

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

The announcement touched off small protests in a few opposition strongholds but also celebrations in pro-Kenyatta areas. Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga said the Oct. 26 election was a farce. Civil society groups also cited problems with the vote.

The violence has for the most part seen protesters clash with police but some Kenyans fear it is starting to take on ethnic overtones after two deaths in clashes between rival groups at the weekend. At least 66 people have died in overall election violence.

On Monday, the U.S. ambassador said Washington was “profoundly concerned” by the outbreaks of violence since the re-run. Kenya is east Africa’s richest economy and a key security ally of the West against militant Islam. It also a key regional trade, logistics and trade hub.

In his victory speech, Kenyatta repeated his belief that his victory in the original Aug. 8 election was legitimate and said dialogue would have to wait if the opposition was going to lodge court cases again. The Supreme Court nullified the Aug. 8 vote on procedural grounds.

“My victory today is just part of a process that is likely to once again be subjected to a constitutional test through our courts ... I will submit to this constitutional path regardless of the outcome,” Kenyatta said.

“Those who are going to ask me: ‘Are you going to engage in dialogue?’ ... Let them (the opposition) first and foremost exhaust all their constitutional options.”

Kenyatta took 98 percent of the vote, results from 266 out of 291 constituencies showed. The electoral commission said 7,616,217 valid votes were cast, representing 39 percent of the 19.6 million registered voters.

Protests by Odinga’s supporters prevented polling stations from opening in 25 constituencies.

The election commission said poor security prevented voting in those areas but the final announcement could go ahead as it would not “materially affect” the result.

In the pro-Kenyatta area of Dagoretti North in Nairobi, cars honked and crowds of supporters in red T-shirts ran through the streets.

“I‘m so happy the president has got his seat back,” said Peterson Njau. “Now the economy is going to lift up again.”

Another resident, Kennedy Okeyo, said he cared more about football than politics but that ethnic clashes in his home this weekend had unnerved him.

“You can’t get to work, and even if you get to work, you can get attacked because of who you are,” he said.

SMALL PROTESTS

But just down the road in Nairobi’s Kawangware slum, around 100 youths listening to the results on mobile phones chanted “No Raila No Peace”. They lit a bonfire in the middle of the street and began taunting riot police with cries of “the people want teargas”.

Earlier, police dispersed protesters there with teargas when they tried to block a visit by Interior Minister Fred Matiang‘i.

Another Nairobi shanty town, Mathare, the scene of deadly clashes between police and protesters immediately after the August vote, was largely calm although a handful of protesters lit a small fire.

And in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga’s political heartland, around 50 youths began to block the road at the Kondele roundabout, the epicenter of protests, while others banged metal poles together. But the protest was small.

“What can I do? They’ve already announced it. Even if I burn tires, nothing will change,” said 25-year-old laborer Kennedy Omondi as he watched young men set a barricade alight.

Odinga pulled out of last week’s vote, saying the electoral commission had failed to institute reforms to forestall the kind of “illegalities and irregularities” that scuppered Kenyatta’s victory in the August election.

Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu, a coalition of civil society organizations with 2,000 election observers, said there were “multiple” cases where results from polling stations differed from results on the forms posted on the election portal after last week’s vote.

Reuters reported in June that McAfee was among several Western technology companies that had acceded in recent years to greater demands by Moscow for access to source code, the instructions that control basic operations of computer equipment.

The reviews, conducted in secure facilities known as “clean rooms” by Russian companies with expertise in technology testing, are required by Russian defense agencies for the stated purpose of ensuring no hidden “backdoors” exist in foreign-made software.

But security experts and former U.S. officials have said those inspections provide Russia with opportunities to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited in offensive cyber operations.

McAfee ended the reviews earlier this year after spinning off from Intel in April as an independent company, a McAfee spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters last week.

The company declined to give a precise timeline for when it stopped allowing such reviews.

“The new McAfee has defined all its own new processes, reflecting business, competitive and threat landscapes unique to our space,” the spokeswoman said. “This decision is a result of this transition effort.”

She added that there had been no evidence of a security issue related to the reviews.

McAfee’s decision follows a similar move by competitor Symantec, which in early 2016 adopted a global policy of refusing to comply with any government-mandated source code reviews required to win entry to a market.

Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clark told Reuters earlier this month the decision resulted from fears the agreements would compromise the security of its products.

Reuters reported this month that Hewlett Packard Enterprise allowed one such testing company, Echelon, to review on behalf of a Russian defense agency the source code of cyber defense software known as ArcSight, which is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks.

That arrangement has prompted questions from lawmakers in Washington amid broader concerns about Russia’s use of digital means to sow discord and interference in elections in the United States and other Western countries, allegations the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.

In a letter last week to Defense Secretary James Mattis, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen asked how the Pentagon manages risks when using software that has been scrutinized by foreign governments.

HPE has said in the past that such reviews have taken place for years at a research and development center it operates outside of Russia.

The software maker has also said it closely supervised the process and that no code was allowed to leave the premises, ensuring it did not compromise the safety of its products. A company spokeswoman said earlier this month that no current HPE products have undergone Russian source code reviews.

ArcSight was sold to British tech company Micro Focus International Plc in a deal completed in September.

Micro Focus said this month that while source code reviews were a common industry practice, it would restrict future reviews by “high-risk” governments and subject them to chief executive approval.

McAfee also allowed Echelon to review its software source code, Reuters reported in June. Such tests were conducted in a secure environment at a McAfee facility in the United States where the source code could not be copied, a spokeswoman said.

The company spokeswoman said the new policy would prohibit third-party entities, including Echelon, from doing reviews on behalf of governments.",McAfee says it no longer will permit government source code reviews,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-russia-mcafee/mcafee-says-it-no-longer-will-permit-government-source-code-reviews-idUSKBN1CV2MP

ISS on Wednesday issued a report to guide institutional investors in a vote next week where the hedge fund manager hopes to win three ADP board seats. The proxy adviser recommended shareholders largely vote for the company’s slate but supported Ackman’s election.

Ackman’s filing, an usual criticism of a proxy adviser by an activist, came hours after the human resources outsourcing company’s board chair John Jones said in a letter to shareholders that ADP is not underperforming and plans to improve margins and profit further.

“ADP provided non-public, inaccurate and misleading information, claims, and arguments which were relied upon by ISS,” Ackman said in a regulatory filing made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

ADP and ISS had no immediate comment on Monday.

Ackman’s unveiled his stake of 8.3 percent, including 2 percent in common shares, in ADP in August, and has since criticized the company for what he calls sluggish earnings and inefficient operations. He plans to hold another investor webinar on Nov. 1.

“ISS accepted, and in its Report has publicly endorsed, certain misleading or incorrect factual assertions made by ADP management during its engagement with ISS,” Ackman said in the filing.

ISS said in its recommendation that shareholders should withhold their vote for ADP director Eric Fast to make room for Ackman but that the case was not “sufficiently compelling to justify replacing three directors.”

Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones last week both recommended all of Ackman’s directors.

Ackman took aim at the projection provided by ADP’s board chair on Wednesday, in which he said the company plans to improve its operating margin by 500 basis points between 2017 and 2020 and speed up its profit growth.

“This is a new and inaccurate disclosure that we believe is demonstrably false, and is intended to mislead shareholders and others about the lack of progress implied by ADP’s plan,” Ackman said in the filing.

Ackman also said that ISS failed to follow its own guidelines stating that it relies only on publicly disclosed information to reach its recommendations.

He flagged ADP’s labor productivity figures and the reference to an “upcoming release” of the Vantage 2.0 platform in the ISS report.

“The disclosure that ADP is close to releasing a Vantage 2.0 product offering for the Enterprise segment is material, even more so in the context of this proxy contest,” he said.",Ackman says ADP provided 'misleading' claims to ISS: filing,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CZ2BX-OCATC

1/APPLE EYED

Time for another slice of Apple.

Amazon, Google and Twitter may have helped put to bed worries of a mass tech roll-over, but investors will be nervously awaiting results from Apple due on Thursday after reports of tepid demand for its new iPhones.

Just by its size it will have a strong impact on market sentiment. But for all the focus on the gains made by the U.S. FAANGs as they have come to be known (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google), there are other stocks that are roaring.

Europe’s tech sector, for example, hit its highest in nearly 16 years this week after stellar results from the likes of ST Micro and AMS - which is up 190 percent this year - and the STOXX 600 tech sector is far outperforming the Nasdaq in dollar terms.

Parts of the new iPhone, and features including face recognition technology and motion sensors, are made or designed in Europe, so Apple’s results could have a far-reaching impact.

2/GOING UP

To hear some economists talk, the Bank of England (BoE) is about to make a big mistake - raise interest rates just as the UK economy heads into what could be a major storm.

If all goes as scripted, the bank will hike borrowing costs on Thursday for the first time in more than 10 years, with the consensus for a rise to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent.

It may be little more than a few basis points, but for markets and sterling in particular it matters.

The currency is up more than 6 percent this year against the dollar but is down over 3 percent on the euro and whether or not this turns out to be a one-and-done move on rates - or the start of something more - could be crucial.

The BoE is not the only central bank in Europe expected to be going for a hike that day. The Czech Republic looks set to raise its interest rates for the second time this year. The Czech crown is the world’s top performing currency, so investors will be watching Prague’s moves closely too.

3/THAT‘S WHAT XI SAID

At a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress, Chinese President Xi Jinping set broad “new era” goals for a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

Crucially, while keeping near-term growth targets, China will not set numerical goals to double GDP from 2021, breaking with past practice. In a bid to move from high-speed to high-quality growth, Xi said China would deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors.

Its “belt and road” development strategy suggests a vision for China to be more integrated into the world economy. There’s a high degree of synchronisation already. Its manufacturing cycle has been moving in tandem with benchmark U.S. 10-year T-note yields in recent years.

There are many obstacles along the road, high corporate leveraging being the most obvious one, but if Xi’s Chinese dream is to be achieved, it may be that a few decades from now global markets will respond to the Chinese economy and not the other way around.

4/EMERGING STRAINS

2017 has so far been one of the best years ever for emerging markets investors with stellar gains on everything from Chinese stocks to local currency sovereign debt.

So this week’s beating for South Africa’s rand after dire budget forecasts, and pain for other high-yielders like the Turkish lira, have triggered some understandable profit taking.

The wider worry, though, is if the dollar starts barreling higher and global bond yields climb more meaningfully investors will be back to worrying about the ghosts and ghouls that come with record levels of debt, much of which has been borrowed in dollars.

5/ON THE JOBS

The monthly installment of U.S. jobs data arrives on Friday.

Last month’s figures saw the first monthly decline in non farm payrolls in seven years. The culprit: Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which hit Texas and Florida. One reason was leisure and hospitality payrolls sliding 111,000, the largest since records began in 1939. Employment at restaurants and bars fell 104,700.

That fall in the sector’s employment shifted “the mix of workers towards higher paying industries” and “biased average hourly earnings higher”, analysts at Morgan Stanley say, but October’s numbers are expected to normalise.

In general, investors will want to see broad-based wage growth. There’s a sweet spot, though, and we could be right in it. Wages are expected to show between 2.5 percent and 3 percent growth after 2.9 percent in September. But if it comes in above 3 percent it could cause concerns about the impact on company profits.

This all matters for the Federal Reserve as it looks to nudge up interest rates again before the year is out.

Privately-held McKinsey, the world’s largest management consultancy, has denied doing anything illegal but said this month that it was embarrassed by mistakes it made while working with South African state utility Eskom last year.

McKinsey said it regretted working on a 1.6 billion rand ($113 million) contract at Eskom alongside a company controlled by the Gupta family, wealthy friends of President Zuma who are accused of unduly influencing government contracts.

Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing.

Barclays Africa and Standard Bank told Reuters in separate emailed responses to questions that they would terminate their relationships with McKinsey without giving reasons.

McKinsey declined to comment.

The Gupta brothers, who work with Zuma’s son, Duduzane, were accused by South Africa’s anti-corruption watchdog last year of using control over state agencies to siphon public funds.

South Africa’s parliamentary committee on public enterprises is investigating whether McKinsey knowingly let funds from Eskom be diverted to Gupta-controlled firm, Trillian, as a way of securing the deal.

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney-General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia’s secessionist government and called a snap regional election for Dec. 21, and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Monday’s calm on the streets of Barcelona resolved a weekend of uncertainty during which it was not clear how the region would respond to central control.

“THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON”

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started worked as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices though some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Two hundred thousand public sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and another 100,000 in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. This compared to 41.1 percent in July according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for sacked regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies who called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

ISS also recommended investors cast advisory votes against the pay of top executives of Fox, the owner of the Fox broadcast network, cable channels and a movie studio.

Twenty-First Century Fox’s annual meeting is scheduled for Nov. 15.

In a report for clients sent to Reuters by a spokesman, ISS said Fox directors had not been responsive to a vote last year in which 69 percent of shares voted were in support of the company’s compensation plan, a relatively low level of backing.

While the pay of Chief Executive James Murdoch, about $20 million for fiscal 2017, was “reasonably aligned” with the company’s performance, the company’s compensation committee does not appear to have adequately moved to address investor concerns, ISS wrote.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

A government document showed that Chad wants to hand over crude oil marketing rights currently held by Glencore under a $1.4 billion loan agreement to Exxon, the biggest oil producer in the Central African country.

Three government and industry sources confirmed the details.

Sources close to Glencore say they believe the contract does not allow such a change.

Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, Chad is renegotiating its hefty external commercial debt, namely to Glencore, which eats up nearly all of its oil profits - the country’s main source of revenue.

The near $1.4 billion debt to Glencore is being restructured for a second time since the 2014 oil price crash, in a move expected to be completed by the year-end or early next year.

Weighed down by drought, a refugee crisis and militant group Boko Haram, the government has become frustrated with Glencore and its handling of the debt restructuring, sources in the administration say.

Since 2014, Exxon has been paying royalties to the government in physical crude cargoes that were subsequently allocated by state firm SHT to Glencore.

But this process will end in early January as the government has asked Exxon to pay royalties in cash instead, according to a letter from the company dating from mid-October.

“In this context, we wish to levy in cash, and not in kind, the royalties due by the Consortium on January 2, 2018,” the letter stated.

The change will see Exxon replace Glencore as the marketer of the royalty oil.

Spokesmen for ExxonMobil and Glencore declined to comment. Chad’s finance ministry did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

Exxon operates the Doba consortium, the biggest producing group in the country at around 63,000 barrels per day (bpd) out of Chad’s 131,000 bpd in 2017, government data showed.

Cash-strapped Chad has received loans from the IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank among other entities, with another $12.9 billion of pledged funding as of September from public and private donors for its 2017-2021 national development plan.

A sticking point, a banking source said, was a request from Chad for another grace period on principal repayment that Glencore had so far refused.

Chad previously had a grace period in 2016, after Brent oil futures hit their lowest level since the end of 2003.

“Glencore does not want to hear about a restructuring,” a government source said. “This is why we have decided to take the marketing of our oil away from them.”

A source close to Glencore said the development would represent a “clear and serious breach of the agreement”.

Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get money out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, entered his plea in federal court in Boston.

Rocha, who pled guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7. While the charges each carry up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 40-month term based on his cooperation.

The 28-year-old’s case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.

Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.

TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.

Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced in March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.

In 2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, asked someone who became a cooperating witness to help transfer cash generated from the scheme that Wanzeler had hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, prosecutors said.

The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.

In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.

After a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex, prosecutors said.

“War is fundamentally unpredictable,” Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told a Senate hearing about a potential new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, Congress’ most significant step in years toward taking back control of its constitutional right to authorize war.

Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson both said existing authorizations should not be repealed until new ones are in place, and stressed that they believe current AUMFs provide sufficient legal authority for ongoing military action.

“The 2001 AUMF provides statutory authority for ongoing U.S. military operations against al-Qaeda; the Taliban; and associated forces, including against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,” Tillerson said in his opening statement.

Republican and Democratic members of Congress have been arguing for years that Congress ceded too much authority over the deployment of U.S. forces to the White House after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. They are also divided over how much control they should exert over the Pentagon. Repeated efforts to write and pass a new AUMF have failed.

Under the Constitution, Congress, not the president, has the right to declare war.

Concerns intensified this month after four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger and previously over Trump’s talk about dealing with North Korea and an April attack on an airfield in Syria.

Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the foreign relations committee, told the hearing the ambush in Niger shows that U.S. forces “can find themselves in combat at any moment.”

Congress has not passed an AUMF since the 2002 measure authorizing the Iraq War. But the legal justification for most military action for the past 16 years is the older authorization passed days after the Sept. 11 attacks, for the campaign against al Qaeda and affiliates.

Backers of a new AUMF say the 2001 authorization has let presidents wage war wherever they like, without spelling out any strategy for Congress, or the public. For example, Islamic State did not exist when the 2001 AUMF was passed.

“I do not think the American people want the United States conducting a global, endless ‘Shadow War,’ under-the-radar, covert and beyond scrutiny,” said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel.

Mattis told the hearing he was not averse to a new authorization.

“Any new congressional expression of unity, whether or not an AUMF, would present a strong statement to the world of America’s determination,” he said in his opening statement.

But he said imposing limits would help America’s adversaries.

“We are more likely to end this fight sooner if we don’t tell our adversary the day we intend to stop fighting,” Mattis said.

Trump’s fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives but there are deep divisions over any possible new authorization within the party, as well as between Republicans and Democrats.

Many more hawkish Republicans do not want a measure exerting too much control over the Pentagon and say military commanders should decide how to fight America’s enemies.

And some Democrats say they want an AUMF that limits why, where and for how long U.S. forces can be sent to fight.",Trump administration officials oppose limits on war authorization,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-defense-authorization/trump-administration-officials-oppose-limits-on-war-authorisation-idUKKBN1CZ0CA?il=0

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier.
Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow.
Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.
“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.","(Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Thursday it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses over the past year and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies, which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue.

Shares of Twitter soared more than 18 percent to $20.31 in afternoon trading. The company also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months.

Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it “will likely be GAAP profitable” in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.

The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat. It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow. It did not name the companies it had inked deals with.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.

COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.

The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party made progress in talks on Monday and they will continue talking on Tuesday, the British government’s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said.

“In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to Parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed,” Brokenshire said in a statement.

“The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night,” he said, adding that the British government would consider “certain additional requests” made by the parties.

Brokenshire had earlier indicated that if there was no deal by the end of Monday it would move to pass an annual budget for the region to ensure essential services are funded.

A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, which observers have warned could destabilize a delicate political balance in the region.

The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province.

But Sinn Fein in January pulled out complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.

Talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP have stalled in recent weeks, in large part over proposals to improve the rights of Irish language speakers.

Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said the government could only be reformed “on the basis of equality, rights and respect”, which would require concessions from the DUP.

While the DUP also said it wanted to see the executive re-established, ahead of the talks it called for London to bring forward the budget “to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland”.

Neither party spoke to assembled media on the state of the talks on Monday evening.

The outcome of talks was not expected to have an impact on the DUP’s agreement to support British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government in the British parliament.",British government extends Northern Ireland talks deadline,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nireland-politics-talks/british-government-extends-northern-ireland-talks-deadline-idUSKBN1CZ2O0?il=0

Gli intermediari multati sono Diamond Private Investment (Dpi) e Idb (sia la società Intermarket Diamond Business spa che Idb Intermediazioni Srl); le banche in questione sono Unicredit, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mps e Banco Bpm.

L‘Autorità garante della concorrenza e del mercato aveva avviato due procedimenti per pratiche commerciali scorrette nei confronti delle due società il primo di febbraio.

Da allora Idb, il broker da più tempo sul mercato, partner di UniCredit e Banco Bpm, ha avviato una riorganizzazione interna e interrotto l‘attività di vendita. Prosegue viceversa l‘offerta di diamanti di Dpi, che ha accordi con Intesa Sanpaolo dal dicembre 2015 e con Mps.

“Le sanzioni irrogate sono state: in un caso, pari complessivamente a 9,35 milioni (2 milioni per Idb; 4 milioni per Unicredit; 3,35 milioni per Banco Bpm); nell’altro caso, pari complessivamente a 6 milioni (1 milione per Dpi; 3 milioni per Banca Intesa; 2 milioni per Mps)”, si legge in una nota dell‘Agcm.

Le quattro banche sono state oggetto di perquisizioni a fine giugno da parte della Guardia di Finanza, che ha acquisito documenti e materiale informatico con l‘ipotesi di reato di truffa. Nessuno dei soggetti oggetto delle perquisizioni all‘epoca ha rilasciato dichiarazioni.

Sul discusso acquisto di diamanti in banca Consob ha acceso un faro dopo che i prezzi di vendita hanno sollevato i dubbi dei media l‘anno scorso, quando il giro d‘affari ha superato i 500 milioni di euro. Erano 300 milioni circa nel 2015, secondo le stime dichiarate da Idb e Dpi. Questi ultimi hanno sempre detto che i prezzi dei loro listini includono una serie di servizi, tra cui la ricerca di un acquirente per la rivendita dei diamanti a un prezzo certo, differenziando così la propria attività da quella delle gioiellerie.

A inizio anno Consob ha annunciato di aver avviato, in collaborazione con Banca D‘Italia e con l‘Antitrust, un‘indagine sulle modalità di vendita dei diamanti per verificare che non siano offerti come prodotto finanziario.

Mps non commenta. Le altre tre banche coinvolte non sono state disponibili per un commento.

Woods, who continues to recover from back surgery and has not played competitively in nine months, will be part of an elite 18-player field.

“I am excited to return to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge,” tournament host and 14-time major champion Woods said in a statement.

”Albany is the perfect setting and it will be great to join this outstanding field...”

The 41-year-old American has only played six competitive rounds in the past two years while trying to recover from multiple back surgeries.

Last year Woods also made a comeback at the same event, ending nearly 16 months on the sidelines, and finished 15th in a final field of 17.

He showed flashes of the brilliant golf that carried him to 14 major titles. However, he also delivered the inept, often finding sandy waste areas off the tee or with his approach shots.

As his back issues continued, Woods returned to the PGA Tour in January. He missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open and shot an opening-round 77 a week later in Dubai before withdrawing.

In April he announced that he had undergone a fourth back operation in three years.

The winner of five tournaments in 2013, Woods has played just 19 events since.

”All of us would be overjoyed if Tiger Woods could come back and play at a high level,“ Woods’ former swing coach Butch Harmon told Sky Sports. ”He’s playing an appropriate event because there are only 18 players, even though they are top echelon players.

”It’s a more relaxed type of event. It’s his tournament. I think he’s going to feel a little more relaxed there.

“We’ll have to see how he is physically, how he is mentally and how his nervous system holds up.”

Woods will not find the competition any easier this year with a top flight field that includes Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, Jason Day, Rickie Fowler, Brooks Koepka, Matt Kuchar and Justin Rose.

The Hero World Challenge will be the latest in a long-running comeback saga that has produced more downs than ups.

The most recent embarrassing setback came last Friday when Woods pleaded guilty in a Florida court to reckless driving and entered a program for first-time offenders, avoiding a conviction on the charge of driving under the influence (DUI) last spring.

He was found asleep in May behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz, which was parked alongside a road not far from his home on Jupiter Island.

Woods had five drugs in his system when he was arrested, but no alcohol, according to a toxicology report. Those drugs included generic forms of the painkillers Vicodin and Dilaudid; the mood drug Xanax; the sleeping pill Ambien, and a drug that contained THC, the active ingredient in marijuana",Woods set to return in Bahamas next month,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-golf-woods/woods-set-to-return-in-bahamas-next-month-idUKKBN1CZ2MW

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent regulator headed by Democrat Richard Cordray, finalized a rule in July barring banks, credit-card issuers and other financial companies from requiring customers to give up their rights to join group lawsuits, known as class actions, and only take potential disputes to closed-door arbitration.

Congress recently voted to kill the rule in a special resolution that Trump, a Republican, is expected to sign into law soon.

“You alone now have the power to safeguard people’s ability to take action together and go to court when they are wronged,” Cordray, expected to resign soon to run for Ohio governor, wrote to Trump.

White House officials were not immediately available to comment on the letter.

In class actions, individuals with the same complaint band together to lower lawsuit costs.

Trump has not vetoed any legislation since taking office in January. But he has frequently criticized both Cordray, appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, and the CFPB, established after the financial crisis to protect individuals against predatory lending.

Cordray wrote he had never met or spoken to Trump, but that “many have told me.... your mind is made up” about the resolution.

Shortly after the Senate passed the resolution last Tuesday, the White House released a statement saying the CFPB rule would give consumers fewer options to resolve disputes quickly and efficiently and would primarily enrich trial lawyers. The administration has also said the CFPB used faulty research to write the rule.

The CFPB says its five-year study into mandatory arbitration was thorough and its rule based on sound data. Rule supporters say arbitration is stacked in favor of companies, which hire the mediators, and that the right to trial is enshrined in the Constitution. On Friday, military veterans also asked for a veto.

Regulators almost never make personal pleas for vetoes, let alone release their requests publicly.

Cordray has a strained relationship with Republicans, who say he has too much power because he both writes and enforces rules and can only be fired “for cause,” a strict standard nearly impossible to meet.

Some 80 protesters outside the Cinematheque Française, which is showcasing Polanski’s films next month, banged on windows and carried posters with slogans such as, “If rape is an art, give Polanski all the (French movie award) Cesars”.

Two members of the Femen group briefly exposed their breasts and shouted “no honors for rapists” in the presence of Polanski before security pushed them outside.

Polanski, who had entered the building through a back entrance, was set to present his new movie “Based on a True Story” at the event.

Earlier this month, Swiss prosecutors said former German actress and model Renate Langer had told authorities that Polanski raped her at his mountain chalet in 1972 when she was 15 years old.

Langer is one of four women who have publicly accused Polanski, 84, of sexually assaulting them when they were teenagers.

The allegations predate the Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal.

Polanski, director of classic films like Rosemary’s Baby, The Pianist and Carnage, has fled U.S. sentencing in 1978 for unlawful sex with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in Los Angeles in 1977 in a case where he pleaded guilty at the time.

“Polanski has no place in an homage organized by a public cultural institution in France. He should be in a US court of justice,” Raphaelle Remy-Leleu, spokeswoman for feminist group “Osez le féminisme” said on French CNews television.

She said the Cinematheque Française was “spitting in the face of victims of male aggression” and complicit to the impunity of the aggressors.

The Cinematheque said in a statement to French media that the organization is honoring Polanski’s work and wants to steer clear of the legal case against him. French Culture Minister Francoise Nyssen has also defended the Polanski retrospective.

“This is about his life’s work, not about the man,” she said on radio France Inter on Friday.

In a statement to Reuters last week, Polanski’s lawyer reiterated that Polanski has acknowledged having had a sexual relationship with Geimer, and repeated that he strongly denies all other allegations against him as totally baseless.

In 2009, Swiss authorities arrested Polanski on his arrival in Zurich to receive a lifetime achievement award at a film festival. Two months later, he was released on bail and put under house arrest in his Gstaad chalet.

In July 2010, he was released from house arrest after authorities decided against extradition because of potential technical faults in the U.S. request and because he had for years come to Switzerland in good faith.

MILANO, 26 ottobre (Reuters) - I commissari straordinari di Alitalia non hanno alcuna preclusione nei confronti dell‘operatore di private Cerberus.

E’ quanto dice, in un‘intervista al Sole 24 Ore, Stefano Paleari, uno dei tre commissari impegnati a garantire la continuità aziendale della compagnia aerea e, contemporaneamente, a venderla.

“Con Cerberus abbiamo avuto incontri”, rivela Paleari, “e i rappresentanti del fondo hanno avuto accesso alla dataroom ... Siamo lusingati per ogni soggetto che abbia manifestato interesse”.

Dunque, nessuna preclusione nei confronti dei soggetti non industriali? “Assolutamente no”, risponde Paleari. “Alitalia ha bisogno di un azionista stabile e con adeguate risorse da investire per lo sviluppo. Non conta se a comprare sia un fondo di private equity come Cerberus o un grande vettore internazionale”.

Per quanto riguarda il processo di risanamento di Alitalia, Paleari anticipa che “il secondo semestre del 2017 si chiuderà con un ebitda in sostanziale pareggio”. E ancora: “Entreremo nel 2018 con una dotazione finanziaria di oltre 800 milioni, di poco inferiore al prestito ponte ricevuto. Non solo: i ricavi per la prima volta da alcuni anni sono tornati a crescere e siamo riusciti a tagliare nel complesso oltre 120 milioni di costi operativi su base annua”. Insomma, “possiamo garantire già ora la continuità aziendale per il 2018”.

Paleari, però, si lamenta dei “costi esterni che gravano su Alitalia”. E riserva una critica ad AdR (Atlantia: la compagnia paga “oltre 200 milioni all‘aeroporto di Fiumicino... siamo costretti a sostenere costi crescenti pur restando a parità di servizi”. Pertanto, il commissario chiede una discussione “su come arrivare ad una competizione (nei trasporti) su basi più equilibrate e paritarie”. “Quello del commissario straordinario Paleari è un discorso relativo ai costi sostenuti dalla compagnia aerea. Con Adr c‘è un costante dialogo nella ricerca delle migliori soluzioni per la soddisfazione dell‘utente e la crescita del traffico aereo italiano” precisa l‘ufficio stampa Alitalia.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

So an anxious Crone, 29, a stay-at-home mother of two young children, put on a movie for her kids and went upstairs to the bedroom of her Hanover, Pennsylvania, home to tell him about being sexually assaulted nine years ago, before they had met.

“It was scary and brought everything back,” Crone said with a sigh. She had worried about his reaction, in part because he knew one of the men who had assaulted her a decade earlier. “But it just felt like it was time.”

Three weeks after allegations of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s predatory sexual behavior moved millions of women around the world to use the hashtag #MeToo to share their own stories of abuse on social media, more than 20 women contacted by Reuters say they are still grappling with the fallout.

While the prevalence of sexual harassment and abuse fueled a raging public debate, the “Me Too” movement also sparked a series of difficult and revelatory private conversations for some women with their spouses, partners and family members.

Charlotte Kirk, 23, felt compelled to tell her mother about a recent incident when a close friend’s boyfriend groped her without consent. She was surprised by the reaction.

“Her response was basically, ‘Believe it or not, this doesn’t get better even after you’re married and have three kids.’ She had been in the exact same position before, too,” said Kirk, a medical research assistant in Boston.

Reilly Downes, 28, had a talk with her father after he saw her “Me Too” post about being assaulted and harassed.

“I didn’t go straight into detail about my story - just kind of made it evident that I have experienced that as a woman,” said Downes, a dance teacher in Amarillo, Texas. “Of course dads want to protect you like nobody’s business, so his response was a little bit more aggressive, angry.”

Her father, Kevin Downes, said “no dad ever wants to hear these things.”

Weinstein, accused by a number of women of sexual harassment and assault in incidents dating back to the 1980s, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

For some women, the outrage over the Weinstein allegations was heightened by the election of President Donald Trump, who bragged on a decade-old “Access Hollywood” outtake that surfaced during last year’s campaign about kissing and touching women because “when you are a star, they let you do it.”

The Trump tape followed a string of harassment and assault cases involving well-known and powerful men, including comedian Bill Cosby, who denied sexual assault allegations by dozens of women.

‘WAKE-UP CALL’

Trump’s subsequent victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, the first woman presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party, was a “wake-up call” for many women, said Karin Roland of the women’s advocacy group UltraViolet.

To remind people of the “Access Hollywood” tape, UltraViolet parked a large screen on the Mall near the Washington Monument recently to play the tape repeatedly for 12 hours on the one-year anniversary of its release.

Trump apologized last year for his “Access Hollywood” comments, which he called “locker room talk.” He told reporters two weeks ago that allegations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled at him before the election by several women were “made-up stuff.”

Activist Tarana Burke first created the “Me Too” campaign a decade ago to reach sexual assault victims in underprivileged communities. But it became a rallying cry after the Weinstein allegations, when actress Alyssa Milano urged women who had been victims of sexual assault and harassment to use it as a way to convey the scale of the problem.

In a Reuters/Ipsos online poll of 1,832 people taken Oct. 20-24, more than half of all adults said they had experienced an unwanted verbal or physical sexual advance. Of those, 11 percent said they had posted a ""Me Too"" status and 14 percent had reposted or engaged in a ""Me Too"" conversation without sharing a personal experience. Forty-four percent said they had seen the campaign but not participated. (tmsnrt.rs/2gPHRr0)

Leona Waller, 25, a freelance writer in Berkeley, California, said she sat up in bed to prepare her “Me Too” post as her boyfriend slept next to her. She had never directly told him about a sexual assault in college “when no didn’t mean no” to her attacker.

“I actually handed him my phone and showed him the full post that I had written,” she said. “He just hugged me. It was a moment.”

But sometimes those conversations are just too painful to have. A father from Alabama contacted through social media, who asked that his name not be used because of the sensitivity of the subject, said he learned his 22-year-old daughter had been raped after the “Me Too” movement inspired her to tell his wife about it.

He said he is unsure what to say to her about it. “I know of nothing that I could say that would be comforting, other than, ‘I love you, and you have nothing to be ashamed of. This is not your fault’,” he said.","After 'Me Too', 'scary' personal conversations about sexual assault",https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-metoo/after-me-too-scary-personal-conversations-about-sexual-assault-idINKBN1CZ15X

FILE PHOTO: Smoke rises from chimneys and cooling towers of a refinery in Ningbo, Zhejiang province August 19, 2014. REUTERS/China Daily/File Photo CHINA OUT. NO COMMERCIAL OR EDITORIAL SALES IN CHINA

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

FILE PHOTO: Employees close a valve of a pipe at a PetroChina refinery in Lanzhou, Gansu province January 7, 2011. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

The Cupertino-based company does not provide pre-order figures on iPhones, leaving investors and analysts in the dark in trying to track output through research with its suppliers, consumer surveys and other industry indicators.

But positive commentary from analysts on Monday signaled strong demand for the pricey device with pre-orders starting this past Friday.

Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results this Thursday. The company provides sales figures in its results.

Since the launch of new iPhones on Sept.12, the stock had fallen 2.5 percent until last Thursday’s close. They rebounded on Friday after Apple said pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were “off the charts”.

The stock climbed to $168.07 earlier in the session, adding nearly $26 billion to its market cap and inching it closer to becoming the first company with a trillion dollar valuation. Shares pared gains and were up 1.9 percent at $166.15 mid-day.

Daniel Ives, a well-known sector analyst, raised his forecast on Monday for pre-orders by 10 million, and several other analysts talked up sales over the next year.

In a note, Ives of research house GBH Insights, raised his pre-order demand expectations for the iPhone X to 50 million units from 40 million, calling the first stage of the iPhone X release a “stellar success”.

“With the official launch of iPhone X in Apple retail stores slated for this Friday, Nov. 3, we anticipate very high demand globally with limited supply of iPhone X on hand,” Ives said.

Jeffrey Kvaal from brokerage Nomura Instinet, said Apple and U.S. wireless carriers’ pushing out of delivery times for iPhone X orders to 5-6 weeks was longer than for previous phones and pointed to strong demand.

Asked by Reuters whether production bottlenecks are causing shipment delays, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth responded: “No, there’s no bottlenecks. This is a company that manages the supply chain well.”

However, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, cautioned that the longer wait times for consumers ordering phones may be as much due to the component supply issues, which led Apple to delay the launch of the premium phone until November.

“Although we believe Apple is benefiting from strong demand from the iPhone X, the company is also struggling with supply constraints,” White, who has a buy rating on Apple, said.

“A sound debate around the key driver for the surging shipping lead times can be made by reasonable people. Thus we believe it was important for Apple to highlight the demand side of the equation for the iPhone X.”

Wall Street is bullish on Apple with 31 of 38 brokerages rating the stock “buy” or higher. Their median price target of $180 projects a market cap of nearly $930 billion for the iPhone maker.",Apple touches record as brokerages bullish on iPhone X demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CZ21H-OCATC

REUTERS/Joe Penney/File Photo

As expected, Menendez and his co-defendant, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, declined to take the witness stand in their defense. Closing arguments were set to begin no earlier than Wednesday morning.

Menendez, 63, is accused of accepting bribes from Melgen, including luxury vacations, private flights and campaign contributions, in exchange for using his political influence to help Melgen in a variety of ways.

Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have told the jury in Newark, New Jersey, that they did nothing wrong and that their actions stemmed from a close, brother-like relationship.

The case could have an outsized effect on Capitol Hill, where Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 edge in the Senate. If Menendez is convicted and either resigns or is expelled before Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s term expires in January, the governor would presumably name a Republican to replace him.

The Democratic candidate to succeed Christie, Phil Murphy, holds a comfortable lead in polls ahead of the state’s gubernatorial election on Nov. 7.

A Republican effort to repeal former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law failed by a single vote in the Senate in July, and the party’s pursuit of tax reform is expected to be similarly hard-fought.

Defense attorneys ended their case on Monday soon after the judge overseeing the trial, William Walls, denied their request to declare a mistrial. The lawyers had argued that Walls unfairly limited the witnesses and evidence they could present to jurors.

Menendez intervened with Medicare officials on Melgen’s behalf after the agency determined the doctor had overbilled it by millions of dollars, according to prosecutors. Melgen was convicted separately earlier this year in Florida of Medicare fraud, though the New Jersey jury has not heard about that case.

In addition, the senator pressed U.S. officials to resolve a port dispute in the Dominican Republic involving one of Melgen’s business ventures and to issue visas for several of Melgen’s foreign girlfriends, prosecutors say.

Among the witnesses who appeared for the defense were two of Menendez’s colleagues: Republican U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham and Democratic U.S. Senator Cory Booker, who is New Jersey’s other senator.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered an investigation into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys for him, as she tries to tackle a culture of sexual harassment in politics.

Mark Garnier, a junior international trade minister, asked secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy two sex toys and he also called her “sugar tits”, the Mail on Sunday reported.

Garnier told the paper that the comment was part of an amusing conversation about a television show, and that asking her to buy the toys was “good humored high jinks”.

Edmondson, in comments to the paper, disputed Garnier’s recollection of the incidents, including his assertion that they were “high jinks”.

The report came after another British newspaper, the Sun, on Friday described a culture of sexual harassment among lawmakers and their staff working in parliament.

Garnier was not immediately available for comment to Reuters through his constituency or parliamentary offices.

May’s spokeswoman said on Friday after the Sun’s report that any unwanted sexual behavior was “completely unacceptable” and any minister who acted inappropriately would face “serious action”.

Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said on Sunday May had asked officials to investigate if Garnier, whose role is outside the cabinet immediately surrounding May, had broken the government ministers’ code of behavior.

“These stories, if they are true, are obviously totally unacceptable,” Hunt told BBC television.

“The Cabinet Office will be conducting an investigation as to whether there has been a breach of the ministerial code in this particular case, but as you know the facts are disputed.”

May, in a letter released to media, also asked John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, on Sunday for his advice about changing the culture there.

“I believe it is important that those who work in the House of Commons are treated properly and fairly, as would be expected in any modern workplace,” May said in the letter.

She said measures such as a disciplinary procedure suggested by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and a voluntary code of conduct offered by the Conservative Party to its lawmakers did not go far enough.

“I believe that we must establish a House-wide mediation service complemented by a contractually binding grievance procedure available for all MPs (lawmakers) irrespective of their party banner,” she said in the letter.

“It is vital that staff and the public have confidence in parliament, and resolving this employment irregularity on a cross-party basis can play an important role in this.”

Reports of inappropriate behavior in British politics, and in other industries, came in the wake of dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Britain’s environment minister Michael Gove apologized on Saturday after he likened being interviewed by a BBC radio presenter to entering Weinstein’s bedroom. After the analogy was widely criticized, Gove, a cabinet minister, apologized for what he said was a “clumsy attempt at humor”.

The Sun newspaper said on Friday that women working in politics in Westminster had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators.

“The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics,” May’s spokeswoman said on Friday.",British minister to be investigated over sexual harassment allegation,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-harassment/minister-to-be-investigated-over-sexual-harassment-allegation-idUKKBN1CY0HO

The announcement touched off small protests in a few opposition strongholds but also celebrations in pro-Kenyatta areas. Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga said the Oct. 26 election was a farce. Civil society groups also cited problems with the vote.

The violence has for the most part seen protesters clash with police but some Kenyans fear it is starting to take on ethnic overtones after two deaths in clashes between rival groups at the weekend. At least 66 people have died in overall election violence.

On Monday, the U.S. ambassador said Washington was “profoundly concerned” by the outbreaks of violence since the re-run. Kenya is east Africa’s richest economy and a key security ally of the West against militant Islam. It also a key regional trade, logistics and trade hub.

In his victory speech, Kenyatta repeated his belief that his victory in the original Aug. 8 election was legitimate and said dialogue would have to wait if the opposition was going to lodge court cases again. The Supreme Court nullified the Aug. 8 vote on procedural grounds.

“My victory today is just part of a process that is likely to once again be subjected to a constitutional test through our courts ... I will submit to this constitutional path regardless of the outcome,” Kenyatta said.

“Those who are going to ask me: ‘Are you going to engage in dialogue?’ ... Let them (the opposition) first and foremost exhaust all their constitutional options.”

Kenyatta took 98 percent of the vote, results from 266 out of 291 constituencies showed. The electoral commission said 7,616,217 valid votes were cast, representing 39 percent of the 19.6 million registered voters.

Protests by Odinga’s supporters prevented polling stations from opening in 25 constituencies.

The election commission said poor security prevented voting in those areas but the final announcement could go ahead as it would not “materially affect” the result.

In the pro-Kenyatta area of Dagoretti North in Nairobi, cars honked and crowds of supporters in red T-shirts ran through the streets.

“I‘m so happy the president has got his seat back,” said Peterson Njau. “Now the economy is going to lift up again.”

Another resident, Kennedy Okeyo, said he cared more about football than politics but that ethnic clashes in his home this weekend had unnerved him.

“You can’t get to work, and even if you get to work, you can get attacked because of who you are,” he said.

SMALL PROTESTS

But just down the road in Nairobi’s Kawangware slum, around 100 youths listening to the results on mobile phones chanted “No Raila No Peace”. They lit a bonfire in the middle of the street and began taunting riot police with cries of “the people want teargas”.

Earlier, police dispersed protesters there with teargas when they tried to block a visit by Interior Minister Fred Matiang‘i.

Another Nairobi shanty town, Mathare, the scene of deadly clashes between police and protesters immediately after the August vote, was largely calm although a handful of protesters lit a small fire.

And in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga’s political heartland, around 50 youths began to block the road at the Kondele roundabout, the epicenter of protests, while others banged metal poles together. But the protest was small.

“What can I do? They’ve already announced it. Even if I burn tires, nothing will change,” said 25-year-old laborer Kennedy Omondi as he watched young men set a barricade alight.

Odinga pulled out of last week’s vote, saying the electoral commission had failed to institute reforms to forestall the kind of “illegalities and irregularities” that scuppered Kenyatta’s victory in the August election.

Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu, a coalition of civil society organizations with 2,000 election observers, said there were “multiple” cases where results from polling stations differed from results on the forms posted on the election portal after last week’s vote.

In a report, they supplied a photo taken by their observers of the tally sheet for Bashaal market center in Garissa. It showed 133 votes for Kenyatta while the form displayed online showed 433 votes.

Another form posted on the election website, from Tumbeni primary school in Kakamega, showed four votes for Odinga and two for another minor candidate but recorded the total number of votes cast was 77 votes cast.",Kenyan President Kenyatta wins 98 percent of vote in repeat election,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-kenya-election/kenyan-president-kenyatta-wins-98-percent-of-vote-in-repeat-election-idUKKBN1CZ12Z

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney-General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia’s secessionist government and called a snap regional election for Dec. 21, and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Monday’s calm on the streets of Barcelona resolved a weekend of uncertainty during which it was not clear how the region would respond to central control.

“THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON”

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started worked as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices though some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Two hundred thousand public sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and another 100,000 in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. This compared to 41.1 percent in July according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for sacked regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies who called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain’s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country’s rating.",Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CZ0IN

Demand for the hybrid home-portable Switch has led to a near-doubling of Nintendo’s stock price to nine-year highs since the device’s March launch. Sales have exceeded the company’s initial estimate, outstripping those of predecessor Wii U, and leaving suppliers scrambling for parts.

“We’ve boosted Switch production to meet strong demand as it was difficult for customers to buy the consoles at retail stores,” Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said at an earnings briefing, adding the firm misjudged demand.

The Switch’s early success has fueled hopes for strong earnings in the coming years, as solid demand for new consoles is widely regarded as a prelude to strong sales of high-margin game software over several years.

However competition is set to intensify into the year-end holiday shopping season as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) releases its high-powered, high-resolution Xbox One X console on Nov. 7.

“The true power of the Switch would be tested during the upcoming holiday season,” Kimishima said.

NEW EXPERIENCES

Nintendo now expects profit of 120 billion yen ($1.06 billion) for the year ending March versus 65 billion yen estimated three months ago, boosted by Switch sales as well as a weaker yen against the euro. The new outlook is still below a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of 133.60 billion yen drawn from the projections of 22 analysts.

Nintendo also raised its year-end Switch sales forecast to 14 million consoles from 10 million. The new annual target would alone exceed lifetime sales of 13.56 million consoles for the Wii U, which was on the market for about five years.

The preceding blockbuster Wii, which debuted in late 2006, sold about 20 million in its first year and went on to sell over 100 million units.

Nintendo sold about 2.9 million Switch consoles in the three months through September, bringing the cumulative total to 7.63 million units.

Kimishima also said Nintendo is preparing game software that provides Switch users with new “experiences”. The software has the potential to attract new users and boost sales, he said, declining to elaborate.

RELIANCE

The results come at a time when Nintendo is trying to reduce reliance on consoles and stabilize fluctuating profit by moving into new areas such as smartphone gaming and theme parks with its roster of popular characters.

But Kimishima reiterated the main purpose of branching out is to increase encounters with non-gamers to stimulate console sales.

Nintendo also said for the three months through September, operating profit reached 23.75 billion yen, reversing a year-earlier loss of 812 million yen.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, under fire in recent days over conflict-of-interest allegations, pointed to stronger-than-expected economic growth as proof the Liberal strategy of deficit spending had paid dividends in the two years since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a surprise majority.

“So now, with a little more wind in our sails, we’re doubling down on a plan with proven results and reinvesting in the middle class,” Morneau said in a speech to parliament.

The government has been badly shaken by charges that Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell (MSI.TO), was in a conflict of interest because he did not place his holdings in a blind trust, but hopes the fiscal update will reset pubic focus on the strong economy.

The deficit was projected to shrink to C$19.9 billion this year from C$28.5 billion projected in the March budget, but the improvement included a reduction in the government’s so-called fiscal cushion to C$1.5 billion from C$3 billion in March.

The budget shortfall was forecast to shrink further, to C$18.6 billion next year and to C$12.5 billion by the end of the budget’s five-year horizon in 2022-23. Each of those years included a C$3 billion fiscal cushion, a risk adjustment that economists consider prudent.

Morneau’s update had little impact on financial markets, but the additional stimulus may give the Bank of Canada more room to continue to hike interest rates, though no move is expected at the bank’s next policy decision on Wednesday.

“You kind of have a hand off from monetary policy to the federal government by way of fiscal stimulus,” said Scott Smith, managing partner at Viewpoint Investment Partners. “If you can thread the needle, then it’s a great strategy ... the challenge comes if there’s a hiccup in any link of the chain as it pertains to either monetary or fiscal policy.”

Morneau said the government would strengthen the child benefit by indexing it to inflation from next July, a pledge that will cost C$5.6 billion over five years, and increase the tax benefit for low-income workers.

He forecast GDP growth to slow to 2.1 percent in 2018 and 1.6 percent in 2019, from 3.1 percent this year.

Together with the smaller deficits, the growth would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 30.5 percent this year from 31.2 in 2016-2017 and gradually to 28.5 percent by 2022-23, better than most G7 rivals.","Canada to unveil smaller budget deficit, hopes will shift focus",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CT2WG-OCADN

The multi-party Democratic Unity coalition has had a tough 2017, first failing to bring down Maduro in four months of protests that led to 125 deaths, then losing surprisingly to the Socialist Party in a gubernatorial election earlier this month.

That has left the opposition weakened and divided, and Maduro strengthened, despite growing foreign pressure on his government over alleged rights abuses and corruption, and an unprecedented economic crisis that has millions skipping food.

Three heavyweight movements in the opposition - Justice First, Popular Will and Democratic Action - announced on Monday they did not trust the government-leaning election board sufficiently to participate in the municipal polls in December.

Justice First leader Julio Borges, who also heads the opposition-led congress, said authorities cheated in the 2013 presidential election, denied Venezuelans a recall referendum last year, and rigged the Oct. 15 gubernatorial vote.

So instead of going into another “manipulated” vote, the opposition should focus on demanding reforms to the election board in anticipation of next year’s presidential poll, he said.

“The objective remains getting Nicolas Maduro out of power, and in this struggle, the world is with us,” he told reporters.

To the surprise of some, the Democratic Action party also joined the boycott. Its candidates won four governorships in October’s vote and then infuriated many opposition supporters by swearing loyalty to a pro-Maduro legislative superbody.

Opposition supporters have been split over participating in elections this year. Some say it is the only way to show they are a majority and undermine Maduro, while a growing number argue there is no point in fighting a “dictator” via a system rigged in his favor.

They are pinning their hopes on international action, including U.S. sanctions against Maduro’s government.

Maduro, whose personal popularity has plunged since his 2013 election due to food shortages and runaway inflation, said “sabotage” and “insurrection” were being planned against the mayoral votes.

“I declare myself in battle,” the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez said in a meeting with governors on Monday.

“Those who attack the election system must pay.”

Opposition leaders say the government has long been rigging elections by gross abuse of state funds in favor of socialist candidates, and dirty tricks such the last-minute moving of vote centers in opposition areas for the October ballot.

They have also presented some allegations of ballot-rigging.

However, Maduro insists Venezuela’s system is entirely trustworthy and impossible to hack. It has received international praise in the past, although it was slammed over July’s vote for the Constituent Assembly superbody.

Maduro says the street protests earlier this year were a mask for a U.S.-backed coup plot, and accuses opponents of wanting to oust him by undemocratic means.

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: China's media crackdown won't work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-chinas-media-crackdown-wont-work-idUSKBN1CW2JW

Third-quarter results provided a rough guide for potential bulls. The message to incoming Chief Executive John Flint is clear: more of the same, please.

True, HSBC’s adjusted pre-tax profit for the quarter was 1 percent lower than in the same period last year as costs grew faster than income. More significant, however, is the 6 percent year-on-year jump in pre-tax profit from Asia, the region that accounts for around 70 percent of HSBC’s earnings. Robust economic growth there meant lending in the third quarter was 17 percent higher than a year ago.

HSBC’s undiminished ability to attract deposits – savers’ balances have increased by 5 percent this year – means it has plenty of spare ammunition for lending. The bank’s loan to deposit ratio remains a relatively conservative 70 percent. Though it’s strange to hear an institution founded in Hong Kong and Shanghai 152 years ago talk of a “pivot to Asia”, the region continues to offer promise.

HSBC’s large pool of dollar-denominated and sterling accounts is turning from a drag to a source of strength. The bank reckons each 25 basis-point rise in dollar interest rates in the United States and Hong Kong roughly yields an additional $330 million in net interest income. A similar uptick in UK borrowing costs would add an extra $106 million. As the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens, and the Bank of England prepares to do so, HSBC’s lowly net interest margin of 1.63 percent should expand and revenues increase. That in turn will help boost the bank’s return on tangible equity which, at 9.3 percent for the first nine months of 2017, is already close to its 10 percent target.

Flint, who formally takes charge in February, has scope to make further improvements. A strategic review might question the utility of having a Mexican bank. HSBC’s 19 percent stake in China’s Bank of Communications looks increasingly hard to justify. Yet these problems are minor when compared to the challenges faced by some of HSBC’s European peers.

Before Monday, HSBC shares had beaten the STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index by 3 percent this year.

Akzo, the maker of Dulux paint, said on Monday it was in “constructive talks” about a “merger of equals” in what would be the first major deal by Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker, who took over in July after Akzo spurned a 26 billion euro ($30.2 billion) offer from U.S. rival PPG Industries.

Reuters reported on Friday that Akzo had approached Axalta about a possible merger, sending Axalta’s shares 17 percent higher. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest Axalta investor with a stake of just under 10 percent.

“This seems a classic attack-is-the-best-defense strategy,” said a fund manager at one of Akzo’s top-10 investors who asked not to be named.

“Akzo overpromised after defending their own company and started to fail to deliver in Q3, so (they) need to do something transformational,” he added.

At 19.5 billion euros ($22.7 billion), Akzo’s market value is close to three times that of Axalta at $8.1 billion at Friday’s closing price of $33.15.

Even after the planned sale of its chemicals divisions, valued at 8-10 billion euros, the Dutch group would tower over its prospective partner, suggesting a lead role that typically results in a premium being offered to the junior partner.

Akzo said plans to divest the chemicals unit remained on track and a “vast majority” of net proceeds from the deal would be returned to shareholders.

Axalta’s coatings for new vehicles could fill a gap in Akzo’s portfolio, which caters to various other industries including manufacturing, marine and construction, analysts have said.

STIRRING THE POT

The relatively fragmented global paints and coatings industry has seen a frenzy of deal activity, as buyers seek scale to squeeze their raw materials bill to further bolster already attractive margins.

PPG’s aborted move for Akzo followed BASF deals last year, selling its industrial coatings business to Akzo and buying Albemarle’s surface-treatment unit Chemetall for $3.2 billion to focus on automotive coatings.

Before that, Sherwin-Williams snatched up rival U.S. paint company Valspar in an all-cash deal valued at about $9.3 billion.

The mooted combination would make Akzo the second-largest coatings player with a 12 percent market share, ahead of PPG but trailing an enlarged Sherwin Williams, analysts at brokerage Raymond James said.

Vanlancker has been forced to cut targets made in the heat of the takeover battle twice in the space of six weeks, blaming disruption caused by hurricane Harvey, rising raw materials costs and “headwinds” at its marine coatings business.

Akzo shares were 0.5 percent higher at 77.89 euros at 1120 GMT, well below a figure of around 96 euros proposed by PPG.

PRESSURE TO DELIVER

Analyst Joost van Beek of Theodoor Gilissen said that in negotiations over financial terms, Axalta would seek to take advantage of Akzo being under pressure to bulk up.

Analysts at Bernstein, in turn, stressed the strategic rationale, saying in a note the Akzo-Axalta merger “would improve scale and density in segments and countries where needed while taking out costs, most likely in the fragmented general industrial segment and in Europe”.

They forecast savings of around 250 million euros from combining operations.

Akzo would not comment on how the deal could be structured, though describing it as a merger suggests it would pay mostly with shares.

Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that talks were at an early stage and there was no guarantee the companies would come to an agreement.

Akzo has gone through tumultuous times of late.

After PPG’s approach was fended off, a group of shareholders launched a court case seeking a vote to have Chairman Antony Burgmans removed, but lost.

Akzo’s CEO and CFO then resigned, citing health reasons, while Burgmans is due to retire next year.

He told reporters at the Mexican Grand Prix that he wanted the Australian to stay alongside Dutch 20-year-old Max Verstappen, who has a long-term contract.

Ricciardo will be in the final season of a five-year deal in 2018 and has been linked to Mercedes and Ferrari in media speculation.

“The next move he makes at 28 years of age is a very important one for him. So of course I’m sure he’s going to take the time to make sure the decision is right for him,” said Horner.

“But he knows the intent very clearly, and I’ve discussed it with him, is that we want him in the team. If that takes another six months, then so be it.”

Verstappen won the race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, his second victory of the season, while Ricciardo celebrated victory in Azerbaijan in June.

The Australian’s race ended after barely a handful of laps on Sunday, however, with a turbo problem.

“I think he’s keen to see what engine performance looks like next year, which is understandable,” said Horner.

Red Bull used Renault engines, branded Tag Heuer. While the former champions have won three times this year and taken more points than Ferrari in recent races, they have also suffered frequent failures.

“He knows how we go about our racing and how we treat the two drivers, which he’s extremely comfortable and happy with,” he said of Ricciardo.

”I think, as his character has developed and as his personality has come across, he sees the fit between Daniel Ricciardo and Red Bull.

“I think he sees the capability that we have within the team. And I think he’s very happy in the team.”

Asked what would happen if Ricciardo decided to leave, Horner said Red Bull were prepared for that.

“That’s why we kept Carlos Sainz on loan, that’s why we have options around us. We have a safety net but our number one objective is to retain the pairing that we have,” he said.

Sainz has been loaned from Toro Rosso to Renault as part of an engine deal that allowed the Red Bull-owned team to end a contract with the French manufacturer and partner Honda next season.","Motor racing: Red Bull to give Ricciardo time, see Sainz as 'safety net'",https://www.reuters.com/article/motor-f1-redbull-ricciardo/motor-racing-red-bull-to-give-ricciardo-time-see-sainz-as-safety-net-idINKBN1CZ2QX?il=0

The 53-year-old Martinez agreed to terms on a three-year contract with an option for a fourth year, making him the seventh manager in Nationals history since they moved from Montreal before the 2005 season.

Martinez was considered the front-runner to replace Dusty Baker, who was fired last week after two seasons. This is the first major league managerial assignment of Martinez’s career.

“We are delighted to bring Dave aboard and excited about what he will bring to our clubhouse and our dugout,” Theodore N. Lerner, managing principal owner of the Nationals, said in a statement. “We have been very clear about our goals as an organization and we feel confident we’ve found the right man to help us reach them.”

Martinez joins the Nationals for what will be his 30th season in professional baseball. A 16-year major league outfielder, Martinez has been a coach for the last 10 seasons, serving as Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon’s bench coach and right-hand man in Chicago (2015-17) as well as with the Tampa Bay Rays (2008-14).

When Maddon became the manager of the Cubs before the 2015 season, Martinez followed him to Chicago. A year later, the Cubs won the 2016 World Series title for the team’s first championship in 108 years.

”I am excited to bring Dave into our family,“ Nationals president of baseball operations and general manager Mike Rizzo said in making the announcement in a statement. ”As we went through this process it became clear the type of manager we were looking for -- someone who is progressive, someone who can connect with and communicate well with our players, and someone who embraces the analytical side of the game.

“We came away from the process feeling like there was absolutely no one better suited -- who matched up to what this organization needs right now -- than Dave.”

Martinez was a .276 career hitter in the majors while playing for nine different teams.

Shares of the world’s second largest confectionary company rose 4.7 percent to $41.15 in after-market trading on Monday.

Mondelez, in its last quarter under the leadership of longtime CEO Irene Rosenfeld, reported 4.6 percent rise in sales in Latin America and a 4.7 percent rise in Europe.

Rosenfeld’s departure comes after years of consistent decline in sales following a spin-off of its Kraft grocery business in 2012, a move that she engineered.

Current McCain Foods CEO Dirk Van de Put will replace Rosenfeld in November.

On Monday, the company said it had moved past the cyber attack that hit shipment volumes last quarter, recovering 0.6 percent in net revenue.

Net sales from the company’s key brands, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka chocolate and Oreo cookies, rose 5.6 percent to $4.77 billion.

Net income attributable to Mondelez rose 81 percent to $992 million, or 65 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, helped by one-time gains and taxes.[GNXOGLJSa]

“Non è una società in crisi, distribuisce dividendi”, ha detto presentando alla stampa la 92esima Giornata del risparmio, in agenda domani.

Il Tesoro sta studiando il conferimento a Cassa Depositi e Prestiti della sua quota in Enav entro fine anno, un progetto che è ad uno stadio molto avanzato, secondo quanto riferito a Reuters da tre fonti. il 17 ottobre.

Cdp è controllata dal Tesoro con l‘82,77% del capitale ed è partecipata con circa il 16% dalle Fondazioni di origine bancaria.

Guzzetti chiarisce poi che la Cassa non può essere messa in mezzo per il salvataggio di aziende in crisi come Alitalia o per esigenze di risanamento pubblico.

“Siamo azionisti silenti per quanto basta ma determinanti per quanto sarà necessario”, spiega.

“Molti dimenticano che lo statuto della Cdp vieta di investire in aziende in passivo e fin qui devo dire che Cdp, nonstante le sollecitazioni... Cdp non può per statuto metter soldi in Alitalia, non può essere la croce rossa, non è un ente a disposizione delle esigenze di risanamento, deve investire in aziende sane”.

“Fin qui questo limite di non avviare Cdp su strade vietate è stato difeso. Qualora questo dovesse verificarsi non voteremo mai o impediremo qualsiasi iniziativa che compromettesse gli equilibri di bilancio di Cdp, questo deve essere chiaro a tutti”, dice.

Secondo due fonti a conoscenza del dossier, il governo teme un giudizio negativo dell‘Antitrust europeo sull‘acquisizione di Ilva da parte di ArcelorMittal e Marcegaglia e ha chiesto a Cdp di entrare nella cordata che acquisirà il primo gruppo siderurgico italiano.

Guzzetti mostra riserve anche sul progetto Capricorn, l‘ipotesi emersa mesi fa di conferire alla Cassa le più importante partecipazioni del Tesoro.

“Noi ipotesi di questo genere non le conosciamo. Ci hanno smentito che si stiano approfondendo. Senza il nostro voto lo statuto di Cdp non si cambia”, ha detto Guzzetti.

Burnley moved up to seventh in the Premier League after a 74th minute strike from Irish midfielder Jeff Hendrick gave them a 1-0 win over Newcastle United at Turf Moor on Monday.

Their fourth win of the campaign moves Burnley level on 16 points with Liverpool while promoted Newcastle slip to ninth but it was a game which most neutrals will quickly forget.

On a cold night in East Lancashire, neither side were able to find their rhythm and for a large part of the game a goalless draw looked the most likely outcome.

Burnley, without club record signing Chris Wood who was sidelined by a hamstring injury, began brightly with Jack Cork and Steven Defour controlling the centre of midfield as the Clarets enjoyed plenty of early possession.

But Newcastle gradually grew into the game and fired an early warning shot in the 17th minute when Jonjo Shelvey warmed the hands of Burnley keeper Nick Pope after being set up by Christian Atsu.

There was little to excite the crowd in the opening 45 minutes but right after the interval Spaniard Ayoze Perez went close for Newcastle with a curling effort from the left that Pope did well to push around the post.

Burnley responded by taking a firm grip on proceedings in midfield with Cork influential with his incisive passing and vision, although too often lone striker Ashley Barnes was either isolated or not given effective service.

Cork was the creator when Burnley finally broke the deadlock. The former Swansea City midfielder’s low shot was parried by keeper Rob Elliot and Johann Berg Gudmundsson pounced on the loose ball, swinging a low cross to the back post where Hendrick controlled the ball and converted.

The Magpies went close to an equaliser when Spanish forward Joselu screwed a shot just wide of Pope’s right-hand post and manager Rafa Benitez threw on Dwight Gayle as an extra striker.

The home side’s Barnes then nearly got some reward for his hard work with a low effort which Elliot had to tip wide.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

Facebook gave the details about the reach of Russian posts in written testimony it provided to U.S. lawmakers, which was seen by Reuters.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) separately has found 2,752 accounts linked to Russian operatives, a source familiar with the company’s written testimony said. That estimate is up from a tally of 201 accounts that Twitter reported in September.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google are scheduled to appear before three congressional committees this week on alleged Russian attempts to spread misinformation in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the election, in which President Donald Trump, a Republican, defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, said in the written testimony that the 80,000 posts from Russia’s Internet Research Agency were a tiny fraction of content on Facebook, equal to one out of 23,000 posts.

However, the posts violated Facebook’s terms of service, and any amount of such activity using fake accounts is too much, Stretch wrote.

“These actions run counter to Facebook’s mission of building community and everything we stand for. And we are determined to do everything we can to address this new threat,” he wrote.

The 80,000 posts were published between June 2015 and August 2017. Most of them focused on divisive social and political messages such as race relations and gun rights, Facebook said.

Twitter’s revised estimate of how many Russia-linked accounts were on its service comes a month after an influential Democratic senator, Mark Warner, slammed the company for what he called an insufficient internal investigation.

Twitter has suspended all 2,752 accounts that it tracked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, and it has given U.S. congressional investigators the account names, the source familiar with the company’s written testimony said.

“State-sanctioned manipulation of elections by sophisticated foreign actors is a new challenge for us - and one that we are determined to meet,” Twitter said in written testimony, according to the source.",Facebook says 126 million Americans may have seen Russia-linked political posts,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CZ2OI-OCATC

1/APPLE EYED

Time for another slice of Apple.

Amazon, Google and Twitter may have helped put to bed worries of a mass tech roll-over, but investors will be nervously awaiting results from Apple due on Thursday after reports of tepid demand for its new iPhones.

Just by its size it will have a strong impact on market sentiment. But for all the focus on the gains made by the U.S. FAANGs as they have come to be known (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google), there are other stocks that are roaring.

Europe’s tech sector, for example, hit its highest in nearly 16 years this week after stellar results from the likes of ST Micro and AMS - which is up 190 percent this year - and the STOXX 600 tech sector is far outperforming the Nasdaq in dollar terms.

Parts of the new iPhone, and features including face recognition technology and motion sensors, are made or designed in Europe, so Apple’s results could have a far-reaching impact.

2/GOING UP

To hear some economists talk, the Bank of England (BoE) is about to make a big mistake - raise interest rates just as the UK economy heads into what could be a major storm.

If all goes as scripted, the bank will hike borrowing costs on Thursday for the first time in more than 10 years, with the consensus for a rise to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent.

It may be little more than a few basis points, but for markets and sterling in particular it matters.

The currency is up more than 6 percent this year against the dollar but is down over 3 percent on the euro and whether or not this turns out to be a one-and-done move on rates - or the start of something more - could be crucial.

The BoE is not the only central bank in Europe expected to be going for a hike that day. The Czech Republic looks set to raise its interest rates for the second time this year. The Czech crown is the world’s top performing currency, so investors will be watching Prague’s moves closely too.

3/THAT‘S WHAT XI SAID

At a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress, Chinese President Xi Jinping set broad “new era” goals for a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

Crucially, while keeping near-term growth targets, China will not set numerical goals to double GDP from 2021, breaking with past practice. In a bid to move from high-speed to high-quality growth, Xi said China would deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors.

Its “belt and road” development strategy suggests a vision for China to be more integrated into the world economy. There’s a high degree of synchronisation already. Its manufacturing cycle has been moving in tandem with benchmark U.S. 10-year T-note yields in recent years.

There are many obstacles along the road, high corporate leveraging being the most obvious one, but if Xi’s Chinese dream is to be achieved, it may be that a few decades from now global markets will respond to the Chinese economy and not the other way around.

4/EMERGING STRAINS

2017 has so far been one of the best years ever for emerging markets investors with stellar gains on everything from Chinese stocks to local currency sovereign debt.

So this week’s beating for South Africa’s rand after dire budget forecasts, and pain for other high-yielders like the Turkish lira, have triggered some understandable profit taking.

The wider worry, though, is if the dollar starts barreling higher and global bond yields climb more meaningfully investors will be back to worrying about the ghosts and ghouls that come with record levels of debt, much of which has been borrowed in dollars.

5/ON THE JOBS

The monthly installment of U.S. jobs data arrives on Friday.

Last month’s figures saw the first monthly decline in non farm payrolls in seven years. The culprit: Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which hit Texas and Florida. One reason was leisure and hospitality payrolls sliding 111,000, the largest since records began in 1939. Employment at restaurants and bars fell 104,700.

That fall in the sector’s employment shifted “the mix of workers towards higher paying industries” and “biased average hourly earnings higher”, analysts at Morgan Stanley say, but October’s numbers are expected to normalise.

In general, investors will want to see broad-based wage growth. There’s a sweet spot, though, and we could be right in it. Wages are expected to show between 2.5 percent and 3 percent growth after 2.9 percent in September. But if it comes in above 3 percent it could cause concerns about the impact on company profits.

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that U.S. Special Operation Forces captured the militant in Libya in the past few days.

Two of the officials identified him as Mustafa al-Imam and said he had played a role in the attack and the ambassador’s death.

The officials said the man was now in the custody of the Department of Justice and being transported back to the United States by the military.

They added that the operation was authorized by President Donald Trump and had notified the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

Militants have exploited chaos following Muammar Gaddafi’s 2011 downfall.

Islamic State took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city.

Islamic State militants has shifted to desert valleys and inland hills southeast of Tripoli as they seek to exploit Libya’s political divisions after their defeat in Sirte.

The Cupertino-based company does not provide pre-order figures on iPhones, leaving investors and analysts in the dark in trying to track output through research with its suppliers, consumer surveys and other industry indicators.

But positive commentary from analysts on Monday signaled strong demand for the pricey device with pre-orders starting this past Friday.

Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results this Thursday. The company provides sales figures in its results.

Since the launch of new iPhones on Sept.12, the stock had fallen 2.5 percent until last Thursday’s close. They rebounded on Friday after Apple said pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were “off the charts”.

The stock climbed to $168.07 earlier in the session, adding nearly $26 billion to its market cap and inching it closer to becoming the first company with a trillion dollar valuation. Shares pared gains and were up 1.9 percent at $166.15 mid-day.

Daniel Ives, a well-known sector analyst, raised his forecast on Monday for pre-orders by 10 million, and several other analysts talked up sales over the next year.

In a note, Ives of research house GBH Insights, raised his pre-order demand expectations for the iPhone X to 50 million units from 40 million, calling the first stage of the iPhone X release a “stellar success”.

“With the official launch of iPhone X in Apple retail stores slated for this Friday, Nov. 3, we anticipate very high demand globally with limited supply of iPhone X on hand,” Ives said.

Jeffrey Kvaal from brokerage Nomura Instinet, said Apple and U.S. wireless carriers’ pushing out of delivery times for iPhone X orders to 5-6 weeks was longer than for previous phones and pointed to strong demand.

Asked by Reuters whether production bottlenecks are causing shipment delays, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth responded: “No, there’s no bottlenecks. This is a company that manages the supply chain well.”

However, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, cautioned that the longer wait times for consumers ordering phones may be as much due to the component supply issues, which led Apple to delay the launch of the premium phone until November.

“Although we believe Apple is benefiting from strong demand from the iPhone X, the company is also struggling with supply constraints,” White, who has a buy rating on Apple, said.

“A sound debate around the key driver for the surging shipping lead times can be made by reasonable people. Thus we believe it was important for Apple to highlight the demand side of the equation for the iPhone X.”

Wall Street is bullish on Apple with 31 of 38 brokerages rating the stock “buy” or higher. Their median price target of $180 projects a market cap of nearly $930 billion for the iPhone maker.",Apple touches record as brokerages bullish on iPhone X demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/apple-touches-record-as-brokerages-bullish-on-iphone-x-demand-idUSKBN1CZ21H

Sunday’s shock 2-1 defeat to Liga newcomers Girona saw them fall eight points behind arch rivals Barcelona in the standings, the biggest gap they have faced with a league leader since their final turbulent campaign under Jose Mourinho in 2012/13.

Madrid were also defending champions in the Portuguese’s final campaign but came unstuck at the start of the season, dropping eight points in their first four games while Barcelona raced ahead, eventually finishing 15 clear of Madrid while Mourinho had an acrimonious split with the dressing room.

The feeling in the Spanish sports press after Zinedine Zidane’s side threw away a 1-0 lead at halftime was one of resignation about Madrid’s faltering campaign, as the 32-times Liga champions have never managed to win the title after falling eight points behind the leaders.

“Madrid vote no to La Liga”, ran a headline on the website of daily newspaper Marca, alluding to the political undertones of Sunday’s game at Girona, Real’s first trip to the troubled region of Catalonia since a banned referendum on independence on Oct. 1 sparked Spain’s worst political crisis in 39 years.

Only Madrid’s goalscorer Isco and forward Karim Benzema were exempt from criticism in Marca, which criticised the team’s usual talisman Cristiano Ronaldo for only scoring once this campaign and called out Marcelo, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and captain Sergio Ramos for unconvincing displays.

“Isco is out on his own”, ran the cover of newspaper AS, while daily ABC described Madrid as “apathetic”, calling the defeat the team’s worst performance since Zidane took over at the club in January 2016 and began a winning cycle that has yielded seven trophies.

The French coach said Real had lost the game due to two lapses of concentration in the space of four minutes which lead to Cristhian Stuani’s equaliser and Portu’s winner, but denied there was a problem with the team’s attitude.

“What I‘m most annoyed about is not killing the game off when we had the chance to do it,” the coach said in a news conference after Girona snapped Real’s record run of 13 consecutive away wins over the course of two seasons.

Burnley moved up to seventh in the Premier League after a 74th minute strike from Irish midfielder Jeff Hendrick gave them a 1-0 win over Newcastle United at Turf Moor on Monday.

Their fourth win of the campaign moves Burnley level on 16 points with Liverpool while promoted Newcastle slip to ninth but it was a game which most neutrals will quickly forget.

On a cold night in East Lancashire, neither side were able to find their rhythm and for a large part of the game a goalless draw looked the most likely outcome.

Burnley, without club record signing Chris Wood who was sidelined by a hamstring injury, began brightly with Jack Cork and Steven Defour controlling the centre of midfield as the Clarets enjoyed plenty of early possession.

But Newcastle gradually grew into the game and fired an early warning shot in the 17th minute when Jonjo Shelvey warmed the hands of Burnley keeper Nick Pope after being set up by Christian Atsu.

There was little to excite the crowd in the opening 45 minutes but right after the interval Spaniard Ayoze Perez went close for Newcastle with a curling effort from the left that Pope did well to push around the post.

Burnley responded by taking a firm grip on proceedings in midfield with Cork influential with his incisive passing and vision, although too often lone striker Ashley Barnes was either isolated or not given effective service.

Cork was the creator when Burnley finally broke the deadlock. The former Swansea City midfielder’s low shot was parried by keeper Rob Elliot and Johann Berg Gudmundsson pounced on the loose ball, swinging a low cross to the back post where Hendrick controlled the ball and converted.

The Magpies went close to an equaliser when Spanish forward Joselu screwed a shot just wide of Pope’s right-hand post and manager Rafa Benitez threw on Dwight Gayle as an extra striker.

The home side’s Barnes then nearly got some reward for his hard work with a low effort which Elliot had to tip wide.

Trade Minister David Parker told Radio New Zealand that Labour still found the foreign ownership rules “abhorrent”, but that trade officials had told him not all changes would be possible given how late it was in negotiations.

“We’re pretty good at trade agreements...so we rate our ability work through these issues in the best interest of New Zealand,” he said.","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand’s trade minister said on Tuesday that it may be too late to make significant changes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after his new Labour-led government said last week it would seek to renegotiate the agreement.

The Labour Party, which took the helm last week, has taken issue with the fact that the deal is at odds with its plans to ban foreign ownership of existing houses, a key campaign promise.

The 11 TPP members had set a goal of reaching broad agreement on the pact on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam next week and some fear New Zealand’s renegotiation could unravel the agreement.

Trade Minister David Parker told Radio New Zealand that Labour still found the foreign ownership rules “abhorrent”, but that trade officials had told him not all changes would be possible given how late it was in negotiations.

“That doesn’t mean to say we won’t be able to change anything and it doesn’t mean to say that perhaps through mechanisms outside of the TPP we will perhaps be able to fix other things,” Parker said.

His comments suggested the government could instead focus on a change to domestic law to get around the TPP rules, which Parker had flagged as an option the previous day.

Parker added that he would release more details on the “mechanisms” to achieve the foreign housing ban later this week.

Trade experts told Reuters that New Zealand could include housing in the country’s domestic legislation regulating foreign investment, which overrides the TPP.

The TPP currently requires member states to give foreign investors equal treatment to locals unless there are specific exemptions.

The Labour party would like an exemption for existing homes, similar to Australia’s carve out.

New Zealand’s current exception allows it to add a tax to foreigners purchasing homes, but Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said that would not work and an outright ban was needed.

Ardern’s government campaigned to restrict foreign buyers to reduce demand as the country tackles what Labour says is a housing crisis left unresolved by the previous government.

Parker on Tuesday would not confirm whether New Zealand was willing to walk away from the TPP over the issue, saying that would undermine the country’s negotiating position.

O maior banco privado do país anunciou nesta segunda-feira que seu lucro recorrente do período somou 6,254 bilhões de reais, alta de 11,8 por cento sobre um ano antes e de 1,4 por cento na comparação seqüencial. Em termos líquidos, o lucro somou 6,077 bilhões de reais, alta de 1,05 por cento sobre o trimestre imediatamente anterior e de 12,66 por cento ano a ano.

A linha do balanço que mede os gastos do banco com perdas por empréstimos de má qualidade, chamada custo de crédito, foi de 3,99 bilhões de reais, valor 10,8 por cento menor na base sequencial e 28,5 por cento mais baixo que o registrado na mesma etapa de 2016. A despesa com provisão para calotes desabou 30,6 por cento na comparação anual.

O índice de inadimplência, medido pelo saldo de operações vencidas com mais de 90 dias em relação à carteira total, ficou em 3,2 por cento, estável sobre o trimestre anterior e com queda de 0,7 ponto percentual contra mesmo intervalo do ano passado.

Um indicador antecedente sobre o comportamento esperado da inadimplência nos próximos meses, o NPL, apontou declínio pelo quarto trimestre seguido, recuo de 35,2 por cento em 12 meses.

Em outra frente, as receitas do banco com tarifas e seguros cresceram 3,7 e 5 por cento nas bases sequencial e anual, respectivamente, para 9,845 bilhões de reais. A fatia dessa linha no chamado produto bancário atingiu 37 por cento, o pico em dois anos.

Por fim, o Itaú Unibanco teve queda de 4,5 por cento das despesas administrativas, a 11,82 bilhões de reais, movimento puxado sobretudo pelo recuo de 14,4 por cento das despesas de pessoal.

Com isso, o banco conseguiu compensar o novo declínio na carteira de crédito. O estoque de empréstimos, incluindo garantias e títulos privados, fechou junho em 575,2 bilhões de reais, queda de 1,3 por cento em três meses e de 4,4 por cento sobre o fim do primeiro trimestre de 2016.

Além do menor volume de empréstimos, o banco também viu uma contração de 2,2 por cento na margem financeira com clientes, refletindo principalmente os efeitos da queda da Selic e o impacto da nova regulamentação de cartões de crédito, que pressionou os ganhos nas operações com o rotativo.

A contração do crédito do Itaú Unibanco foi na contramão do Santander Brasil, que na semana passada anunciou aceleração do crédito com um dos pilares para aumento do lucro trimestral.

The Republican president, who is considering Powell, current Fed Chair Janet Yellen and three others for the top central bank job, will announce his decision on Thursday, a White House official said separately.

By picking Powell, a soft-spoken centrist and Fed governor since 2012, Trump would get the combination of a leadership change and the continuity offered by somebody who has been a part of the Yellen-run Fed that has kept the economy and markets steady in recent years.

Powell, 64, has supported Yellen’s general direction in setting monetary policy, and in recent years has shared her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates.

“Powell has not offended people, and that’s a huge advantage in Washington. He’s the kind of guy who can get through Senate confirmation, and this administration has so many other problems to deal with,” said John Silva, chief economist at Wells Fargo.

The main challenger to Powell is Stanford University economist John Taylor, a favorite of conservative Republicans who believe monetary policy has been too loose under Yellen and want the central bank to rely more on rules when setting rates.

Taylor has spent the last two decades refining and pushing for wider use of a rule that sets out where rates should be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. His rule implies they should be higher than they are now.

Critics say that a Taylor-run Fed would run the risk of tightening monetary policy too fast and choking off the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

The race for the Fed job has shifted between Yellen, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama to a one-year term in 2014, Powell and Taylor in recent weeks. Financial markets had pushed Treasury yields higher on talk Taylor would get the job.

The Washington Post reported last week that Marc Elias, a lawyer for 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Clinton, used campaign funds to hire Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier. Committees in both chambers of Congress have been investigating the origin and contents of the document.

John Podesta, who was Clinton’s campaign chairman, and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was the head of the Democratic National Committee at the time, as well as Elias “absolutely need to be recalled“ to testify,” Collins said in an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

”It’s difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance,“ Collins said. ”But perhaps there’s something more going on here. But certainly, it’s worth additional questioning of those two witnesses. And the lawyer; absolutely, he more than anyone.”

It has been widely reported that supporters of Republican Jeb Bush, a primary opponent of Trump, initially paid for the firm’s research. Perkins Coie, Elias’ law firm, confirmed on Tuesday that it had hired Fusion GPS in April 2016.

The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative online publication backed by billionaire Republican megadonor Paul Singer, said on Friday it was the original funder of the Fusion GPS project to compile opposition research on multiple Republican presidential candidates, including Trump.

Known as the Steele dossier because it was compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, the document identified Russian businessmen and others who U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the Russian government.

Representative Trey Gowdy, a Republican who runs the House Oversight Committee, said in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday” that he was more interested in whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Justice used the dossier in conducting their own probes.

”I don’t expect the (Democratic National Committee) to be objective,“ Gowdy said. ”Almost by definition, opposition research is not objective.

ISS on Wednesday issued a report to guide institutional investors in a vote next week where the hedge fund manager hopes to win three ADP board seats. The proxy adviser recommended shareholders largely vote for the company’s slate but supported Ackman’s election.

Ackman’s filing, an usual criticism of a proxy adviser by an activist, came hours after the human resources outsourcing company’s board chair John Jones said in a letter to shareholders that ADP is not underperforming and plans to improve margins and profit further.

“ADP provided non-public, inaccurate and misleading information, claims, and arguments which were relied upon by ISS,” Ackman said in a regulatory filing made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

ADP and ISS had no immediate comment on Monday.

Ackman’s unveiled his stake of 8.3 percent, including 2 percent in common shares, in ADP in August, and has since criticized the company for what he calls sluggish earnings and inefficient operations. He plans to hold another investor webinar on Nov. 1.

“ISS accepted, and in its Report has publicly endorsed, certain misleading or incorrect factual assertions made by ADP management during its engagement with ISS,” Ackman said in the filing.

ISS said in its recommendation that shareholders should withhold their vote for ADP director Eric Fast to make room for Ackman but that the case was not “sufficiently compelling to justify replacing three directors.”

Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones last week both recommended all of Ackman’s directors.

Ackman took aim at the projection provided by ADP’s board chair on Wednesday, in which he said the company plans to improve its operating margin by 500 basis points between 2017 and 2020 and speed up its profit growth.

“This is a new and inaccurate disclosure that we believe is demonstrably false, and is intended to mislead shareholders and others about the lack of progress implied by ADP’s plan,” Ackman said in the filing.

Ackman also said that ISS failed to follow its own guidelines stating that it relies only on publicly disclosed information to reach its recommendations.

He flagged ADP’s labor productivity figures and the reference to an “upcoming release” of the Vantage 2.0 platform in the ISS report.

“The disclosure that ADP is close to releasing a Vantage 2.0 product offering for the Enterprise segment is material, even more so in the context of this proxy contest,” he said.",Ackman says ADP provided 'misleading' claims to ISS: filing,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-ackman-iss/ackman-says-adp-provided-misleading-claims-to-iss-filing-idUSKBN1CZ2BX?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, Dara Khosrowshahi, arrived in Brazil to lobby against the bill that is due to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday and which threatens the company’s business in a fast-growing foreign market.

Brazil is Uber’s third-largest market, with 17 million users, and the city of Sao Paulo sees more trips on the ride-hailing service than any other city in the world, ahead of New York and Mexico City, according to the company.

A spokesman for the company said the application as it exists could not operate under the new rules, including the use of a taxi license plate on cars owned by Uber drivers.

“The business model we have today would not longer be viable,” Uber’s executive spokesman in Brazil Fabio Sabba told Reuters.

Uber is already battling to keep operating in London after the city’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service and refused to renew its license.

Police said 800 Uber drivers drove through the center of Brazil’s capital Brasilia to protest the bill that many say will put them out of business. Similar protests in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro snarled downtown traffic.

Uber did not organize the drivers’ protests but alerted authorities that they would happen.

“The bill will create so much bureaucracy that it prevents the 500,000 drivers in Brazil from earning income for their families,” Uber said in a statement.

Uber said it has paid 495 million reais ($150 million) in federal and municipal taxes so far this year.

The bill, which has already been approved by the lower house of Congress, would define ride hailing applications as public transport instead of private services and require drivers to get a special permit from city authorities. It would also establish additional regulations and taxes.

If the Senate votes to approve the bill, it will be up to President Michel Temer to sign or veto the legislation or parts of it.

But Goushi Kataoka, a newcomer to the board, may propose ramping up stimulus after dissenting last month to a decision to stand pat on policy, setting back the BOJ’s quest to dial back its massive monetary support, analysts say.

At the two-day meeting ending on Tuesday, the BOJ is set to keep intact a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year bond yield around zero percent.

The market’s focus would be on whether Kataoka will propose expanding stimulus. While any such proposal is likely to be voted down, it may expose a rift in the nine-member board on the future direction of monetary policy.

“If Kataoka proposes additional easing, that would be an important turning point for future debate on monetary policy,” said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.

“The proposal could mark a starting point for shifting the debate within and outside the BOJ, from seeking an exit from easy policy to strengthening stimulus,” he said.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will likely hold a briefing at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision.

In a quarterly review of its projections, the BOJ is seen trimming its inflation forecast for the current year ending in March 2018 from the 1.1 percent it estimated made in July, sources say.

The bank is seen roughly maintaining its price forecasts for fiscal 2018 and 2019, as well as its view that inflation will hit the 2 percent target by March 2020, they said.

The BOJ currently projects inflation will hit 1.5 percent in fiscal 2018 and 1.8 percent the following year.

Japan’s economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and corporate spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.

But core consumer prices rose just 0.7 percent in September from a year earlier, well below the BOJ’s target, keeping the bank under pressure to maintain ultra-easy policy even as its U.S. and European peers begin to scale back their stimulus.",BOJ set to hold fire; focus on dissenter's stimulus preference,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-boj/boj-set-to-hold-fire-focus-on-dissenters-stimulus-preference-idUSKBN1CZ2PL?il=0

Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main man-made greenhouse gas, hit 403.3 parts per million (ppm), up from 400.0 in 2015, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said in its annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin.

That growth rate was 50 percent faster than the average over the past decade, driving CO2 levels 45 percent above pre-industrial levels and further outside the range of 180-280 ppm seen in recent cycles of ice ages and warmer periods.

“Today’s CO2 concentration of ~400 ppm exceeds the natural variability seen over hundreds of thousands of years,” the WMO bulletin said.

The latest data adds to the urgency of a meeting in Bonn next month, when environment ministers from around the world will work on guidelines for the Paris climate accord backed by 195 countries in 2015.

The agreement is already under pressure because U.S. President Donald Trump has said he plans to pull the United States out of the deal, which seeks to limit the rise in temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

Human CO2 emissions from sources such as coal, oil, cement and deforestation reached a record in 2016, and the El Niño weather pattern gave CO2 levels a further boost, the WMO said.

As far as scientists can tell, the world has never experienced a rise in carbon dioxide like that of recent decades, which has happened 100 times faster than when the world was emerging from the last ice age.

Scientists know prehistoric levels from tiny air bubbles found in ancient Antarctic ice cores, and they can derive even older data from fossils and chemicals trapped in sediment.

The last time carbon dioxide levels reached 400 ppm was 3-5 million years ago, in the mid-Pliocene era.

“During that period, global mean surface temperatures were 2–3°C warmer than today, ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica melted and even parts of East Antarctica’s ice retreated, causing the sea level to rise 10–20 m higher than that today,” the WMO bulletin said.

Since 1990, the global warming effect of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases has risen by 40 percent. The two other main gases - methane and nitrous oxide - also grew to record concentrations last year, although at a slower rate of increase than carbon dioxide.","Carbon dioxide levels grew at record pace in 2016, U.N. says",https://in.reuters.com/article/climatechange-greenhouse/carbon-dioxide-levels-grew-at-record-pace-in-2016-u-n-says-idINKBN1CZ0YL

Netflix Inc and the show’s production company also issued a joint statement saying they were “deeply troubled” by actor Anthony Rapp’s allegation in a published interview that Spacey in 1986 had made a sexual advance toward Rapp, who was just 14 at the time.

Netflix did not give an explicit reason for deciding to air one more season of “House of Cards” before pulling the plug on the Emmy-winning, critically acclaimed show, its first original hit series.

But Netflix spokeswoman Karen Barragan said the decision was made months ago, long before the allegation surfaced against Spacey, 58, a two-time Oscar-winning film star, Tony-winning stage performer and former creative director of London’s famed Old Vic theater.

Spacey said in a Twitter post on Sunday that he was “beyond horrified” to learn of Rapp’s account of Spacey’s alleged seduction attempt, which Spacey said he did not recall. Spacey further wrote that he owed Rapp a “sincere apology” for what he said would have been “deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.”

A representative for Spacey did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

In an interview with BuzzFeed, Rapp, now 46, recounted attending a party hosted by Spacey in which the older actor picked him up, brought him to a bed and lay down on top of him after other guests had left.

According to Rapp, the young actor had the impression Spacey was drunk, pushed him away and left.

Spacey, who has won Oscars for the films “The Usual Suspects” and “American Beauty,” also said that Rapp’s story “had encouraged me to address other things in my life.”

“In my life I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I now choose to live life as a gay man,” Spacey wrote.

“I want to deal with this honestly and openly,” he said, “and that starts with me examining my own behavior.”

The actor for years had declined to publicly discuss his sexuality.

Rapp, who went on to star in the hit Broadway musical “Rent,” was starting his career on Broadway at the time of the alleged incident, appearing in a production of “Precious Sons” with Ed Harris and Judith Ivey. Spacey was then on stage with Jack Lemmon in a revival of the Eugene O‘Neill play “Long Day’s Journey Into Night.”

“He was trying to seduce me,” Rapp told BuzzFeed of the encounter with Spacey. “I don’t know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”

Rapp said on Twitter overnight that he had decided to come forward and tell his story, “standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out ... to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me.”

Everything he wanted to say about the experience had been covered in the interview, Rapp tweeted, adding that he had no further comment to make.

Some on social media expressed anger at Spacey’s conflation of an apology for sexual misconduct and a public acknowledgement of being gay.

The improved results from top lenders in the world’s second-largest economy come after successive interest rate cuts dented their interest margins - a key gauge of profitability - while loan defaults rose sharply among struggling borrowers.

The improvement has been aided by a cocktail of policy measures, such as debt-for-equity swaps for struggling state borrowers.

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (601398.SS), the country’s top lender by assets, posted a 3.3 percent rise in third-quarter net profit, versus flat growth a year-ago.

Agricultural Bank of China (AgBank) (601288.SS), China Construction Bank (CCB) (601939.SS) and Bank of Communications (BoCom) (601328.SS) also reported faster quarterly profit growth than a year ago.

ICBC, CCB and AgBank also reported declines in their non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, as they dispose of more of their bad debt. A crackdown on unregulated shadow banking, has also helped.

“The market has been talking about a potential Chinese banking crisis caused by NPLs since 2011,” said Jiahe Chen, chief strategist at Cinda Securities. “But after seven years and banks’ net assets increasing by over 100 percent, it’s now one of the most worthwhile investable industries.”

Non-performing loan ratios fell slightly at CCB, ICBC, BoCom and AgBank, but rose at fourth-ranked Bank of China Ltd (BoC) (3988.HK)(601988.SS), where third-quarter net profit was flat.

MARGINS EXPAND

China posted relatively solid economic growth in the third quarter, driven by a stronger services industry, though there were signs of weakness in real estate and construction as property cooling measures start to bite.

The banks’ quarterly results were “no big surprise,” said Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, who said profit growth would probably slow in the fourth quarter as Beijing’s deleveraging campaign weighs on loan growth and off-balance sheet business, squeezing profitability.

Deleveraging is the policy signal from this month’s Communist Party Congress, he said. Beijing has been clamping down on risk in the financial markets, from reprimanding corrupt financiers to tightening regulation over lending practices.

China’s biggest banks have also managed to sidestep some of the pitfalls faced by their mid-sized peers, which are more vulnerable to a tighter liquidity environment and which earn more of their profits from shadow banking.

For 16 listed Chinese banks, average net interest margins - the difference between interest paid and earned - shrank in the first half by 17 basis points to 2.03 percent, according to an analysis by ratings agency Moody‘s.

But net interest margins rose slightly at CCB, BoCom, ICBC and BoC.

“The big four banks have a strong funding profile and low reliance on market funding, and are thus more resilient to system liquidity tightening,” said Nicholas Zhu, Beijing-based analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.","For China's top lenders, third quarter profits grow, bad loans ease",https://www.reuters.com/article/china-banks-results/for-chinas-top-lenders-q3-profits-grow-bad-loans-ease-idINKBN1CZ1RB

Applauding Pruitt’s move, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the plan to stop power plants from dumping unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere ”a vast, unlawful expansion of government authority” into the energy sector that had been “especially devastating” to coal country.

The reality is different. Republicans say that deregulating carbon pollution will revive the coal industry, but it won’t. The decades-long decline in coal jobs reflects larger economic forces: mechanization, tapped-out coal veins in Appalachia, and stiffer competition from increasingly cheap energy production from solar panels, wind turbines, and natural gas. In the last decade, coal’s share of the U.S. energy portfolio declined from half to one-third. This predates the Clean Power Plan, which has not yet even taken effect.

The Trump administration may not even be able to repeal the Clean Power regulation. Liberal states and environmental groups already are lining up to challenge Pruitt’s plans in court. The federal government is legally obligated to limit carbon pollution and coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source. Unless Republicans change the law, they may be forced to uphold the plan. Anyway, the Democrats will reinstate the rule if they win back control of the White House.

Although Ryan called the Clean Power Plan a “signature climate rule” of the Obama administration, it was Republican President Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which requires EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger human health. In 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that clear evidence — some of it produced by the government’s own scientists — demonstrated that carbon emissions cause global warming, which in turn causes dangers such as smog, deadly heat waves, and hurricanes. Therefore, the court ruled that EPA had to regulate carbon.

George W. Bush stalled on implementation until the end of his administration, and Barack Obama spent his first few years in office trying to craft legislation in which the government would create a cap-and-trade program to regulate carbon. Because the Senate failed to pass cap-and-trade, the Obama administration eventually came up with the Clean Power Plan.

Even if Pruitt were able to convince courts that the Clean Power Plan’s costs outweigh its benefits – an argument for which environmentalists have plenty of counter-evidence – the EPA would still be obligated to come up with a replacement carbon pollution regulation. Courts could order EPA to produce a regulation by a certain time and hold Pruitt in contempt of court if he fails to comply. That’s what happened to EPA administrator William D. Ruckelshaus in 1984 for not issuing standards on radioactive airborne materials.

Although other regulatory rollbacks might trigger apoplexy among green organizations, in this case they say they are certain of victory. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, the largest U.S. environmental organization, while predicting that “Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt will go down in infamy for launching one of the most egregious attacks ever on public health,” also noted, “No matter who is in the White House, EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution.”

To be sure, Pruitt’s plan represents a threat to the environment. Coal is the dirtiest major source of energy in the United States. In addition to contributing to climate change, it produces a host of toxins such as nitrous oxide and mercury and is a major source of smog. When it drafted the Clean Power rule, the EPA estimated that it would prevent 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths per year by 2030. If the courts do let Pruitt repeal the rule, it could slow the transition away from coal, causing dirtier air and more global warming.

However, the only way to lastingly prevent carbon regulation would be to revise the Clean Air Act to stipulate that its standards do not apply to carbon. Republicans in Congress have tried to do just that. Their most recent bill, released in February, immediately attracted over 100 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans.

Preventing carbon regulation would be extremely unpopular. Polls show large majorities of the public, sometimes including a majority of Republican voters, support regulating climate pollution.

As David Doniger, director of the climate program at the left-leaning Natural Resources Defense Council and a former EPA official, told me in April for an article I wrote in The Washington Post: “After the Bush administration...the Clean Air Act was still in effect and the Obama administration started to set things right. It’s not a very satisfying thing to think of this as a 30-years war, but it’s longer than a four-year battle.”

Trump does have considerable political capital invested in the battle. In March, he issued an executive order directing Pruitt to get rid of the Clean Power rule. As a candidate, the president repeatedly promised to end his predecessor’s “war on coal” and put the miners back to work.

However, market realities will make this promise impossible to keep as coal’s slide continues. In 2016, natural gas passed coal as the leading source of American electricity, a shift the U.S. Energy Information Agency finds is “mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices.” There’s no sign of the fracking-driven cheap gas boom abating. In fact, Trump hopes to boost it by deregulating fracking on federal land. Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question. But laws in place from a time when Republicans were more moderate will ultimately ensure that carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants is regulated — insufficient and late though it may be — and coal’s foreordained death will hardly have been slowed at all.",Commentary: EPA repeal of Clean Power Plan won’t get Trump what he wants,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adler-coal-commentary/commentary-epa-repeal-of-clean-power-plan-wont-get-trump-what-he-wants-idUSKBN1CT2TT

The Dodgers, who breezed through regular season and into World Series, were staring at a potential 3-1 series deficit until Cody Bellinger's bat came alive when he doubled and scored the tying run in the seventh inning. Bellinger, who had been hitless in his previous 13 plate appearances, then put the Dodgers ahead in the ninth with a run-scoring double as part of a five-run inning that was capped by Joc Pederson's three-run blast. ""We've been doing it all year. We're a super resilient team,"" said Bellinger, whose Dodgers are now guaranteed to host a Game Six on Tuesday. ""Taking one here to make sure we go back to LA is huge."" The game had been a tight affair as both teams got stellar outings from their starting pitchers. Dodgers left-hander Alex Wood was working on a no-hitter when George Springer opened the scoring with a two-out homer in the sixth that ended the pitcher's night. The Dodgers responded an inning later when a Logan Forsythe scored single Bellinger. ""I was glad to keep us in it long enough to where our bats came alive. That felt like us there those last few innings,"" said Wood. ""It's a big win for us. We've got our guy going tomorrow, so we're excited to be able to take it back to LA, too."" Houston's Charlie Morgan was nearly as impressive as he allowed just three hits in 6-1/3 innings. The Astros sent closer Ken Giles out for the ninth and he promptly allowed a single to Corey Seager, a walk to Justin Turner before Bellinger put the Dodgers ahead. ""He hadn't faced those guys a ton, but they didn't have good swings against him in LA,"" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Giles. ""One ground-ball base hit to start the inning and things sort of sped up on him a little bit, the walk after that."" With the Astros down to their final strike, Alex Bregman homered to left but it proved too little too late as Houston's unbeaten home stretch in the postseason ended at seven games. Game Five of the best-of-seven World Series is scheduled for Sunday in Houston where the Astros will send Dallas Keuchel to the mound against Kershaw in a battle of left-handed former Cy Young Award winners.",Dodgers fans celebrate Game 4 win over Astros,https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/10/29/dodgers-fans-celebrate-game-4-win-over-a?videoId=372839152&videoChannel=117764&channelName=Rough+Cuts

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney-General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia’s secessionist government and called a snap regional election for Dec. 21, and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Monday’s calm on the streets of Barcelona resolved a weekend of uncertainty during which it was not clear how the region would respond to central control.

“THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON”

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started worked as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices though some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Two hundred thousand public sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and another 100,000 in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. This compared to 41.1 percent in July according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for sacked regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies who called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain’s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country’s rating.",Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spanish-prosecutor-accuses-sacked-catalan-leader-of-rebellion-idUSKBN1CZ0IP

Houston lead the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 in the best-of-seven World Series and will just happen to have the postseason’s hottest pitcher on the mound when the Fall Classic resumes on the West Coast on Tuesday.

“These are what it’s all about,” said Verlander. “These are the moments that you want to be a part of as a baseball player. It’s everything you could ask for.”

Verlander, who has yet to win a World Series, has already exceeded expectations when the Astros acquired him a mere minutes before the trade deadline at the end of August.

The 34-year-old former ace of the Detroit Tigers staff has started nine games for the Astros over the last two months and won them all. He even pitched once in relief, and Houston won that one, too.

Astros manager A.J. Hinch, when asked if Verlander fits into his description of a “big-game pitcher”, said the co-ace of his staff fits into a lot of categories given an ability to block out distractions and execute pitches no matter the stage.

“I like more calling these guys big-time pitchers before the game, because that’s what we expect. We expect them to prepare the same. We expect them to show up ready to play. We expect them to produce the executed pitches,” said Hinch.

“When you can do that on this kind of stage you’re called a big-time pitcher regardless of your performance. But oftentimes these guys step up and deliver big-time results, too.”

Verlander is one of just three active players on the Astros and Dodgers rosters with previous World Series experience. He reached the Fall Classic twice with Detroit in 2006 and 2012 but did not pitch particularly well either time.

But the six-time All-Star and former Cy Young Award winner as the American League’s best pitcher has since seemingly always managed to find another gear in pressure-packed situations.

Verlander did just that in the American League Championship Series when, with the Astros facing elimination, he stepped up to the challenge by pitching seven shutout innings in a 7-1 victory that forced a decisive seventh game.

He attributes part of his success to being able to manage his intensity level during the regular season when the stakes are not as high and therefore allowing him to find another gear come the postseason.

“You can’t focus that much mental energy and physical drain on hanging on every single pitch that way and the crowd and the intensity, that it all encompasses, you just can’t do that every single day out for 34, 35 starts,” said Verlander.

“But as soon as the postseason starts you’re living or dying on every single pitch, and your whole team is living or dying on every single pitch. It changes everything.”",Astros' Verlander eager for shot at World Series title,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CZ1M9-OCASP

Shares of the world’s second largest confectionary company rose 4.9 percent to $41.20 in after-market trading on Monday.

Mondelez’s organic revenue, a measure that excludes currency fluctuations, grew 3.2 percent in Europe and 5.4 percent in Latin America in the quarter that marks the end of Irene Rosenfeld’s tenure as its chief executive officer.

The company said its performance in Europe was helped by strong chocolate sales in Germany and the U.K.

However, sales in North America, its second largest market, remains a concern for the packaged goods company.

Net revenue from North America rose 1.3 percent but lagged behind its smaller rival Hershey (HSY.N), which posted a 1.6 percent rise in sales in the region in October.

North America is the only region performing below expectations but the company is confident in improving it in the future, Rosenfeld said in the earnings call.

The company said McCain Foods CEO Dirk Van de Put will take over on Nov. 20 from Rosenfeld.

Rosenfeld’s departure comes after years of consistent decline in sales for Mondelez, which was formed from a spin-off of Kraft’s North America grocery business in 2012 - a move that she engineered.

The snack giant said on Monday it is recovering from last quarter’s cyber attack that hurt shipment volumes and has led to $100 million loss in revenue for the full year.

Total organic net revenue rose 2.8 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30 and the recovery in shipment volumes contributed 0.6 percent to it.

Organic net revenue from its key brands, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka chocolate and Oreo cookies, rose 3.8 percent in the quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent rise, a year earlier.

The company, which is planning to cut about $3 billion in cost by 2018 end, slashed its costs by 14.3 percent to $1.33 billion in the reporting quarter.

Net income attributable to Mondelez rose 81 percent to $992 million, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter, helped by one-time gains and taxes.[GNXOGLJSa]

Excluding items, it earned 57 cents a share and revenue rose 2.1 percent to $6.53 billion.

Amina Okuyeva and Adam Osmayev were in a car that was shot at from bushes near a railway crossing on the outskirts of the capital, interior ministry advisors Anton Gerashchenko and Zoryan Shkiryak said in separate posts on Facebook.

The attack follows a vehicle bombing in Kiev last Thursday, in which two people were killed and three wounded, including Ihor Mosiychuk, a member of the populist opposition Radical Party.

Okuyeva had links to Mosiychuk, having once worked for him in an advisory role.

“As a result of the injuries she sustained, Amina died. Adam Osmayev was wounded, but will live. I just spoke to him on the telephone,” Gerashchenko said.

The incident is the second attempt this year on the life of Osmayev, from Russia’s mainly Muslim Chechnya region. In June, he survived an attack by a gunman, who was in turn shot and wounded by Okuyeva.

Gerashchenko and Shkiryak did not suggest a motive for the latest incident.

SPATE OF BOMBINGS

Mosiychuk has blamed Russia for last week’s bombing, while Ukrainian police have said Russian involvement is one of the possible motives being investigated.

Russia has dismissed the accusations as a product of anti-Russian sentiment in Ukraine.

Relations between Kiev and Moscow collapsed in 2014 after Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and backed a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukrainian regions.

Russian authorities accuse Osmayev of being part of a 2012 plot by Islamist rebels to kill Putin with a bomb in central Moscow.

Osmayev and Okuyeva are well-known figures in Ukraine, having served as volunteers for the Ukrainian military in the fight against pro-Russian rebels.

Moscow has fought two wars with separatists in Chechnya since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The region is now broadly under the control of Moscow, but Chechens are known to have fought both for the pro-Russian rebels and for the Ukrainian army in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Since fighting broke out in the east in 2014, the number of incidents involving explosives outside the conflict zone has increased.

There has been a spate of vehicle bombings over the past 18 months in Kiev, the capital, and elsewhere, but investigators have failed to find those responsible.",Wife of Chechen accused of Putin assassination plot shot dead near Kiev,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CZ2IP

The United States, which did so much via its unnecessary invasion of Iraq and tragic handling of the post-incursion period to nurture the growth of Islamic State, will be largely missing from the scene. Instead, the struggle will, as it did during the fight against the Sunni extremists of Islamic State, involve shifting Sunni and Shi’ite allegiances.

For the moment, there seems to be an easing in the historic tensions between the two main – and often warring – branches of Islam. Religious differences are not the focus; this is a classic geopolitical power struggle for control of Iraq, Syria, and Kurdistan, and for expanding diplomatic and strategic reach throughout the region.

Iran is lined up to be the big winner in Syria. Islamic State's defeat will significantly lessen Sunni influence, and Tehran’s role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's protector will only increase now that it appears Assad will remain in control of some portion of the country. Iran will have pieced together a land corridor to the Mediterranean. The Saudis will be left with little influence.

The same goes for the United States. American forces have been largely relegated to playing traffic cop among various on-again off-again allies such as the Turks and Kurds, each with its own agenda in Syria. Any influence Washington thinks it still has is further diluted by the presence of the Russians, who are there to support Assad while maintaining a permanent presence in the heart of the Middle East. American efforts may wind up as little more than fumbling around to keep Israel and Jordan from overreacting to the increased Iranian influence on their borders.

In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Riyadh appears to be pivoting towards warmer relations with the Shi’ite government in Baghdad. That a Saudi airline is announcing the first return of direct service between the two countries since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 is no coincidence, nor is it an isolated event.

The Saudis also appear ready to take advantage of a looming intra-Shi’ite power struggle in Baghdad among Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, the most religiously zealous of the group, has always been something of a nationalist and is wary of Iranian influence. It is thus not surprising he made friendly trips under official invitation to Sunni Riyadh, and the United Arab Emirates, in recent months.

Sadr is an interesting choice for the Saudis to use to gain influence in Baghdad. Real progress for Riyadh means untangling years of close Iranian cooperation in Iraq, to include limiting the power of the Iranian-backed militias. Sadr has significant influence in that respect, and can use his popularity and credibility to sell Saudi cooperation to his followers who remember Saudi funding of al Qaeda in Iraq and Islamic State over the years. Enhancing Sadr's Shi’ite religious status can further Sunni Saudi goals. During his visit, the Saudis gifted Sadr with $10 million for “rebuilding,” and also astutely threw in some visas for this year’s Hajj pilgrimage for Sadr to distribute.

The Saudis otherwise have little to work with in Iraq compared to Iran. Tehran’s ties to officials in Baghdad are just a tiny part of a deep relationship forged in the bloody fight against the American occupiers and the ousting of Islamic State. Iranian money continues to support Iraq, and the Shi’ite militias are still mostly under Iranian influence.

Iran is also probably the most stable Muslim nation in the Middle East. It has existed more or less within its current borders for thousands of years, and is largely religiously, culturally, and linguistically homogeneous (though keep an eye on the Kurdish minority.) While governed in significant part by its clerics, the country has held a series of increasingly democratic elections. And unlike the Saudi monarchs, Iran’s leaders do not rule in fear of an Islamic revolution. They already had one.

Power struggles create flashpoints, and the Saudi-Iranian fight post-Islamic State is no exception. The Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen has settled into a version of World War One-style trench warfare, with neither side strong enough to win nor weak enough to lose. In an ugly form of stasis, the conflict seems likely to stay within its present borders.

The powder keg is Kurdistan. Though arguably a de facto state since 2003, after the Kurds voted formally voted for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum, Iran and the Iranian-backed government in Baghdad were pressed to make clear they will not tolerate an actual Kurdish nation. With Islamic State nearly defeated and combat-tested Shi’ite militias ready for their next tasks, Tehran and Baghdad no longer need to keep the Kurds on their side. Fighting has already broken out around Kirkuk, an oil-rich city in Iraqi Kurdistan, between forces supported by Baghdad/Tehran and Kurdish fighters – leaving a gap for the Saudis to offer financial or covert support to the Iraqi Kurds.

Saudi involvement could morph an Iraqi civil war into a new proxy struggle right on Iran’s own western border, with the possible complication of further unrest inside Iran by its Kurdish minority.

Andray Abrahamian: Trump's Iran decision hurts chance of a North Korea deal

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

While it may seem odd to write about the changing balance of power in the Middle East largely leaving out the United States, that may well describe America’s range of options post-Islamic State.

Washington’s influence in Baghdad is limited and relations with Iran are in shambles under the Trump administration. It is highly unlikely America will join Iran to fight against Kurdish allies who helped defeat Islamic State. Nor are American troops likely to battle Iranian-led militias in support of Kurdish independence that Washington says it doesn’t really support right now.

That leaves the United States sidelined, with few options other than perhaps supporting the Saudis from afar in whatever anti-Iranian meddling they do in Iraq. A long fall from the heady days of 2003 when America was going to remake the Middle East. The victor after some 14 years of overlapping struggles?

Podesta stepped down on the same day federal investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign charged former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and a business associate, Rick Gates, with money laundering.

Manafort, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment with charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The indictment against Manafort and Gates listed two unnamed firms as “Company A” and “Company B” that lobbied several lawmakers on behalf of Ukraine at Manafort’s request.

The indictment did not name Podesta Group.

A spokesperson for the Podesta Group said after Podesta stepped down on Monday that it had been in contact with investigators on special counsel Robert Mueller’s team and was fully cooperating with the probe.

The spokesperson also said the Podesta Group fully complied with the law in disclosing its lobbying on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a group linked to Manafort and named in the indictment.

Podesta Group filed lobbying disclosures with the Department of Justice in April and August saying it did work in 2012 for the same pro-Russian Ukrainian group for which Manafort had worked. Podesta Group work alongside another Washington lobbying firm, Mercury LLC, which also said on Monday that it was cooperating with Mueller’s team.

No charges were filed against anyone with Podesta Group or Mercury.

Tony Podesta did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Podesta was the head of the firm that bore his name. It did $10.7 million in lobbying in the first nine months of 2017, according to disclosures the firm filed with the U.S. Congress.

He is the brother of John Podesta, who served as chairman of the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and as a senior White House adviser to Democratic former President Barack Obama.

Mueller’s team has been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign, but neither Trump nor the campaign were mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates.

While Podesta Group is seen as a mainly Democratic lobbying firm, Mercury is viewed as mainly a Republican shop. Mercury is a subsidiary of Omnicom Group and does public relations work in addition to lobbying. Omnicom did not reply to a request for comment.

Podesta is listed as a lobbyist on several of the firm’s largest accounts including Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Wal-Mart, Textron and General Dynamics.

The Republican president, who is considering Powell, current Fed Chair Janet Yellen and three others for the top central bank job, will announce his decision on Thursday, a White House official said separately.

By picking Powell, a soft-spoken centrist and Fed governor since 2012, Trump would get the combination of a leadership change and the continuity offered by somebody who has been a part of the Yellen-run Fed that has kept the economy and markets steady in recent years.

Powell, 64, has supported Yellen’s general direction in setting monetary policy, and in recent years has shared her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates.

“Powell has not offended people, and that’s a huge advantage in Washington. He’s the kind of guy who can get through Senate confirmation, and this administration has so many other problems to deal with,” said John Silva, chief economist at Wells Fargo.

The main challenger to Powell is Stanford University economist John Taylor, a favorite of conservative Republicans who believe monetary policy has been too loose under Yellen and want the central bank to rely more on rules when setting rates.

Taylor has spent the last two decades refining and pushing for wider use of a rule that sets out where rates should be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. His rule implies they should be higher than they are now.

Critics say that a Taylor-run Fed would run the risk of tightening monetary policy too fast and choking off the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

The race for the Fed job has shifted between Yellen, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama to a one-year term in 2014, Powell and Taylor in recent weeks. Financial markets had pushed Treasury yields higher on talk Taylor would get the job.

Surgeons were called in to save Miller’s injured leg, league and team sources told ESPN’s Chris Mortensen on Monday.

According to the ESPN report, Miller’s dislocated knee is considered “more significant” than a regular dislocation.

The surgery was performed in New Orleans after the Bears’ 20-12 loss to the Saints to repair a damaged artery in Miller’s leg, according to the ESPN report.

The 33-year-old Miller was carted off the field after dislocating his knee in the third quarter against the Saints. He was taken from the Mercedes-Benz Superdome to a local hospital.

Miller appeared to have caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, but he landed awkwardly on his left leg. After an official review, the scoring catch was reversed because the officials ruled Miller did not maintain control throughout the catch.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with him,” Bears coach John Fox said of Miller after Sunday’s game.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has been badly shaken by the conflict-of-interest controversy about his finance minister, who is the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of Morneau Shepell. Some have questioned whether Morneau, whose father founded Morneau Shepell, would be forced to resign.

Morneau Shepell, a major provider of pension administration services to private companies and government agencies, said it is not involved in the consultation for either changes to the small business tax code or to the pension reform.

“If passed, (the pension reform) would allow federally regulated pension plans the option to implement target benefit pension plans. They would not be required to do this,” the company said in a statement.

“Several provinces have already enacted similar enabling legislation for pension plans that they regulate, but in practice, very few employers have adopted it,” Morneau Shepell said.

The company said it severed all contact with Morneau upon his election to the House of Commons in October 2015. Morneau resigned as executive chairman of Morneau Shepell shortly after his election.

Morneau, who was named finance minister shortly after his election to Parliament, said last week he would put his assets in a blind trust and divest his stockholding in the family business in response to criticism that his proposals for pension or tax reform could benefit his company and his personal finances.

On Thursday, Morneau said he will donate to charity any profit that his Morneau Shepell shares have made since he was elected.

The company’s stock, currently trading at C$21.17, closed at C$15.77 in the session before the election, which would put the potential profit for the 1 million shares Morneau has said he holds at C$5.4 million.

The announcement touched off small protests in a few opposition strongholds but also celebrations in pro-Kenyatta areas. Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga said the Oct. 26 election was a farce. Civil society groups also cited problems with the vote.

The violence has for the most part seen protesters clash with police but some Kenyans fear it is starting to take on ethnic overtones after two deaths in clashes between rival groups at the weekend. At least 66 people have died in overall election violence.

On Monday, the U.S. ambassador said Washington was “profoundly concerned” by the outbreaks of violence since the re-run. Kenya is east Africa’s richest economy and a key security ally of the West against militant Islam. It also a key regional trade, logistics and trade hub.

In his victory speech, Kenyatta repeated his belief that his victory in the original Aug. 8 election was legitimate and said dialogue would have to wait if the opposition was going to lodge court cases again. The Supreme Court nullified the Aug. 8 vote on procedural grounds.

“My victory today is just part of a process that is likely to once again be subjected to a constitutional test through our courts ... I will submit to this constitutional path regardless of the outcome,” Kenyatta said.

“Those who are going to ask me: ‘Are you going to engage in dialogue?’ ... Let them (the opposition) first and foremost exhaust all their constitutional options.”

Kenyatta took 98 percent of the vote, results from 266 out of 291 constituencies showed. The electoral commission said 7,616,217 valid votes were cast, representing 39 percent of the 19.6 million registered voters.

Protests by Odinga’s supporters prevented polling stations from opening in 25 constituencies.

The election commission said poor security prevented voting in those areas but the final announcement could go ahead as it would not “materially affect” the result.

In the pro-Kenyatta area of Dagoretti North in Nairobi, cars honked and crowds of supporters in red T-shirts ran through the streets.

“I‘m so happy the president has got his seat back,” said Peterson Njau. “Now the economy is going to lift up again.”

Another resident, Kennedy Okeyo, said he cared more about football than politics but that ethnic clashes in his home this weekend had unnerved him.

“You can’t get to work, and even if you get to work, you can get attacked because of who you are,” he said.

SMALL PROTESTS

But just down the road in Nairobi’s Kawangware slum, around 100 youths listening to the results on mobile phones chanted “No Raila No Peace”. They lit a bonfire in the middle of the street and began taunting riot police with cries of “the people want teargas”.

Earlier, police dispersed protesters there with teargas when they tried to block a visit by Interior Minister Fred Matiang‘i.

Another Nairobi shanty town, Mathare, the scene of deadly clashes between police and protesters immediately after the August vote, was largely calm although a handful of protesters lit a small fire.

And in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga’s political heartland, around 50 youths began to block the road at the Kondele roundabout, the epicenter of protests, while others banged metal poles together. But the protest was small.

“What can I do? They’ve already announced it. Even if I burn tires, nothing will change,” said 25-year-old laborer Kennedy Omondi as he watched young men set a barricade alight.

Odinga pulled out of last week’s vote, saying the electoral commission had failed to institute reforms to forestall the kind of “illegalities and irregularities” that scuppered Kenyatta’s victory in the August election.

Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu, a coalition of civil society organizations with 2,000 election observers, said there were “multiple” cases where results from polling stations differed from results on the forms posted on the election portal after last week’s vote.

In a report, they supplied a photo taken by their observers of the tally sheet for Bashaal market center in Garissa. It showed 133 votes for Kenyatta while the form displayed online showed 433 votes.

Another form posted on the election website, from Tumbeni primary school in Kakamega, showed four votes for Odinga and two for another minor candidate but recorded the total number of votes cast was 77 votes cast.",Kenyan President Kenyatta wins 98 percent of vote in repeat election,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CZ1EO-OZATP

A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday.

It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.

Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges against them in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday.

The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies.

Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office.

Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine.

The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.

A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.

“We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing.

Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign.

Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said the charges against Manafort could put pressure on him to cooperate with the Russia investigation.

”If I were the defense lawyer, I’d be looking into cooperating,” he said.

In a development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.

Mueller’s office said Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain which stated that he has since “met with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document.

White House spokeswoman Sanders played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election, by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Clinton.

Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

Trump on Monday reiterated his frustration with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” Moscow also denies the allegations.

“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton.

Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.

Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities, the indictment said.

They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said.

The indictment said Manafort owned properties in Manhattan; Brooklyn; the Hamptons; Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Prosecutors said Manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. They also said he had been making payments on four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.

Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman.

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for the Trump administration to avoid interfering with Mueller’s probe.

“The rule of law is paramount in America and the investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded. The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” Schumer said.","Two ex-Trump aides charged in Russia probe, third pleads guilty",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-charges-indictment/two-ex-trump-aides-charged-in-russia-probe-third-pleads-guilty-idUSKBN1CZ1KT?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Fresh from deflecting a takeover from one U.S. rival, the Dutch group confirmed on Monday that it is considering merging its paint unit with another, former DuPont subsidiary Axalta. A combination makes sense. But new Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker is busy grappling with weak results and a chemicals spinoff.

The 20 billion euro Dulux owner has already resisted a 25 billion euro bid from paintmaker PPG and grappled with activist investor Elliott Advisors this year. As part of its defence, it pledged to spin off or sell its specialty chemicals division and boost margins at its coatings businesses. Its CEO and finance chief stepped down. Since taking charge in July, Vanlancker has twice lowered the company’s guidance for 2017 earnings. This is hardly an encouraging backdrop.

There is some logic to combining the world’s third- and fourth-largest paintmakers. Bernstein analysts reckon Akzo and Axalta could cut costs by 250 million euros, equivalent to 2 percent of their combined paint revenue, though competition regulators may demand disposals. Taxed at Akzo’s 26 percent rate and capitalised, the synergies would be worth 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion). That helps explain the $1.2 billion jump in Axalta’s market value after Reuters reported the talks on Friday.

Even so, it’s hard to see how the deal can be a true “merger of equals”, as Akzo suggested in its statement. The Dutch group’s chemicals arm could fetch anywhere between 8 billion euros and 12 billion euros. Take the mid-point of this range, deduct it from Akzo’s enterprise value of 21.1 billion euros, and assume the group’s 1.7 billion euros of debt stays with the paint business. In that scenario, Akzo’s equity would still be worth some 35 percent more than Axalta’s inflated market value.

The worry for Akzo shareholders is that the Dutch company could be willing to hand most of the benefits of a deal to Axalta in an attempt to escape another bid from PPG, which will be free to renew its pursuit in December. Negotiating a big deal with a supposedly equal partner would also suck in resources. Even if the numbers stack up, the risk of Akzo dropping one or more balls is high.",Breakingviews - Axalta deal complicates Akzo's juggling act,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-axalta-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-axalta-deal-complicates-akzos-juggling-act-idUSKBN1CZ2B5

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that U.S. Special Operation Forces captured the militant in Libya in the past few days.

Two of the officials identified him as Mustafa al-Imam and said he had played a role in the attack and the ambassador’s death.

The officials said the man was now in the custody of the Department of Justice and being transported back to the United States by the military.

They added that the operation was authorized by President Donald Trump and had notified the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

Militants have exploited chaos following Muammar Gaddafi’s 2011 downfall.

A previsão para o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) ficou, com isso, abaixo da expectativa do mercado de 2,5 por cento, conforme pesquisa Focus mais recente.

“Achamos que seria mais prudente elaborar Orçamento com previsão de PIB mais baixa, o que nos dá margem de segurança para trabalhar ao longo do próximo ano”, afirmou o ministro do Planejamento, Dyogo Oliveira.

Em coletiva de imprensa, ele também afirmou que uma revisão nesses parâmetros poderá ser feita mais adiante.

Apesar de o presidente da Câmara dos Deputados, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), ter criticado recentemente o envio de MPs pelo governo em detrimento de projetos de lei, o Executivo optou por esse formato para ganhar maior segurança na contabilização das receitas, já que MPs têm efeito imediato.

O ministro do Planejamento avaliou que o ambiente político para tramitação das medidas “sempre de convencimento”, mas adotou um tom de conciliação ao apontar que o Congresso tem toda a soberania para aprová-las ou não.

Serão duas MPs: uma para equiparar a tributação de fundos de investimento fechados com a que vale para os abertos, e outra que englobará a postergação do aumento salarial e a elevação da contribuição previdenciária do funcionalismo. Com a mudança para os fundos, o governo espera arrecadar 6 bilhões de reais líquidos para a União em 2018, receita que fará parte do Orçamento do próximo ano. Hoje, a incidência de Imposto de Renda para os fundos fechados ocorre apenas no fechamento ou resgate de cotas. Com a MP, o imposto será cobrado todos os anos, a exemplo do que ocorre com os demais fundos de investimento. Já com o adiamento em um ano do reajuste salarial do funcionalismo, o governo passou a prever economia de 4,4 bilhões de reais. Antes, a expectativa era de 5,1 bilhões de reais. Segundo Oliveira, a cifra menor reflete principalmente o impacto de contratação de servidores com a realização de concursos públicos no ano que vem. A elevação na contribuição previdenciária de servidores públicos de 11 para 14 por cento para o montante de remuneração que exceder o teto do Regime Geral de Previdência Pública (5.531 reais) deverá render ao governo 2,2 bilhões de reais em 2018, acima do montante de 1,9 bilhão de reais estimado antes.

OLHAR GERAL

Na mensagem modificativa do Orçamento de 2018 que foi enviada ao Congresso, o governo apontou receitas líquidas de 1,213 trilhão de reais e despesas totais de 1,372 trilhão, resultando no déficit primário de 159 bilhões previsto para o governo central (Tesouro Nacional, Banco Central e Previdência Social).

A meta foi afrouxada em 30 bilhões de reais em relação ao alvo anterior. Essa margem passou a comportar receitas adicionais de 14,5 bilhões e despesas de 44,5 bilhões, informou o ministério do Planejamento.

No lado das despesas, o Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC) recebeu forte injeção de recursos, com previsão de 25,92 bilhões de reais, contra apenas 1,97 bilhão de reais antes.

Do lado das receitas, o governo diminuiu em 600 milhões de reais a receita prevista com concessões em 2018, a 18,9 bilhões de reais.

Apesar de ter elevado a projeção de recebimento de recursos com a privatização da Eletrobras a 12,2 bilhões de reais, ante 7,5 bilhões antes, o governo excluiu a operação outrora prevista para o aeroporto de Congonhas, limando com isso 5,1 bilhões da conta de concessões.","Governo envia ao Congresso MPs para garantir Orçamento de 2018, mantém previsão de PIB",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CZ2MY-OBRTP

“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

In a board meeting at Japan’s SoftBank on Friday, several directors expressed doubts about giving up control of Sprint in any deal, the sources said, the latest twist in on-and-off talks to unite the two U.S. wireless carriers that began earlier this summer.

According to tentative deal terms that Reuters was first to report last month, SoftBank and other Sprint shareholders would have received close to 40 percent or a little more of the combined company.

The holdup in negotiations could torpedo plans to merge Sprint and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom, into a single carrier with more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N).

It could also damage the dealmaking credentials of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who has raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, and uses his image as a reliable counterparty to clinch deals.

If talks fall apart, it would be the second time an attempted merger of Sprint and T-Mobile has failed. The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014, but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

EXPLORING OPTIONS

Industry watchers had long expected Sprint and T-Mobile to attempt another deal, especially after a quiet period associated with a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves concluded in April, freeing up companies in the telecom industry to discuss mergers and acquisitions.

But no deal was announced immediately following the conclusion of the restriction on merger talks, and both Sprint and T-Mobile said they were open to exploring other options. A source told Reuters in July that SoftBank was considering an acquisition offer for Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) in a deal where it would combine the cable company with Sprint.

Sprint is in the middle of a turnaround plan and has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs. But industry analysts have expressed concern that the company, weighed down with total debt of $38 billion, has few financial options. Even though its customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by heavy discounting.

Sprint’s junk bonds were among the hardest hit in Monday afternoon trading, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters capital markets news service.

Claure said in August that while Sprint could sustain itself, cost savings from a transaction were significantly better than remaining a standalone entity. Analysts have estimated a deal could result in more than $30 billion in savings.

Sprint shares fell as much as 13 percent on Monday after Nikkei first reported that SoftBank was doubting the deal, and ended down 9.3 percent. T-Mobile shares ended down 5.4 percent.

Nikkei also reported that SoftBank would inform Germany’s Deutsche Telekom that it was calling off the deal talks, but sources who spoke to Reuters could not confirm this.

As of late Monday, T-Mobile still considered the negotiations with Sprint to be active, according to the sources.

Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank declined to comment.

DUE DILIGENCE ALMOST COMPLETE

The due diligence between T-Mobile and Sprint was almost complete as of last week, and the focus had shifted to working out a business plan for the combined company as well as an integration strategy, sources had told Reuters.

Even so, it was not clear that U.S. regulators would clear a deal between the two carriers.

Analysts have expected consolidation in the U.S. wireless industry to ease pricing pressure in the market, which could benefit AT&T and Verizon, who have lost share to their smaller rivals. Cable companies Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) are also entering the market with wireless service on Verizon’s airwaves.

“With no merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as the entrance of Comcast and Charter into wireless, we expect Verizon to have a difficult run going forward,” said Philip Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a research note. Verizon shares closed down 2.1 percent.

“Sprint as well could struggle to maintain positive subscriber momentum as cable enters, making its balance sheet look unsustainable.”

Facebook gave the details about the reach of Russian posts in written testimony it provided to U.S. lawmakers, which was seen by Reuters.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) separately has found 2,752 accounts linked to Russian operatives, a source familiar with the company’s written testimony said. That estimate is up from a tally of 201 accounts that Twitter reported in September.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google are scheduled to appear before three congressional committees this week on alleged Russian attempts to spread misinformation in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the election, in which President Donald Trump, a Republican, defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, said in the written testimony that the 80,000 posts from Russia’s Internet Research Agency were a tiny fraction of content on Facebook, equal to one out of 23,000 posts.

However, the posts violated Facebook’s terms of service, and any amount of such activity using fake accounts is too much, Stretch wrote.

“These actions run counter to Facebook’s mission of building community and everything we stand for. And we are determined to do everything we can to address this new threat,” he wrote.

The 80,000 posts were published between June 2015 and August 2017. Most of them focused on divisive social and political messages such as race relations and gun rights, Facebook said.

Twitter’s revised estimate of how many Russia-linked accounts were on its service comes a month after an influential Democratic senator, Mark Warner, slammed the company for what he called an insufficient internal investigation.

Twitter has suspended all 2,752 accounts that it tracked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, and it has given U.S. congressional investigators the account names, the source familiar with the company’s written testimony said.

“State-sanctioned manipulation of elections by sophisticated foreign actors is a new challenge for us - and one that we are determined to meet,” Twitter said in written testimony, according to the source.",Facebook says 126 million Americans may have seen Russia-linked political posts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-socialmedia/facebook-says-126-million-americans-may-have-seen-russia-linked-political-posts-idUKKBN1CZ2OI

U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he would not continue to certify the multinational 2015 agreement, reached under his predecessor Barack Obama, and warned that he might ultimately terminate it.

Iran would abandon the agreement if it were deemed not be serving its national interests, President Hassan Rouhani said in reaction to Trump’s decision. But he also said, “No president can revoke an international deal...(and) Iran will continue to honour its commitments under the deal.”

The other parties to the accord - Britain, Germany, France, Russia, China and the European Union have all reaffirmed their commitment to it and urged the United States not to back out.

IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, whose inspectors are tasked with monitoring compliance with the deal, reiterated that Iran was adhering to it.

“The IAEA can state that such nuclear-related commitments are being implemented,” Amano told a news conference in Abu Dhabi following a trip to Iran on Sunday where he met with Rouhani and other officials.

“I requested that Iran ... fully implement the nuclear-related commitments. This (was) the main thrust of the meeting in Iran ... Regarding the activities of our inspectors, they are discharging their responsibility without problem,” he said.

Under the agreement, Iran undertook to restrict its nuclear programme to help ensure it could not be put to developing atomic bombs in exchange for the lifting of trade and financial sanctions that had hobbled its oil-based economy.

Amano added that he had told Iranian officials the nuclear deal was a “significant gain for verification”.

Speaking on the sidelines of an international conference on nuclear power in the United Arab Emirates, Amano declined comment on U.S. policy towards Iran and on Iran’s absence from the meeting, which draws together IAEA member states.",Iran fulfilling nuclear deal commitments: IAEA chief,https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea/iran-fulfilling-nuclear-deal-commitments-iaea-chief-idINKBN1CZ0ZR

Late on Friday, Merck withdrew an application for European use of its flagship drug Keytruda as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy, raising questions about future sales.

The Keytruda/chemo combination is already approved in the United States based on initial promising data. But the company determined that a similar European first-line approval without more mature late-stage data was unlikely.

Lung cancer is by far the most lucrative oncology market with first-line approval providing access to the most patients.

In the wake of the news, at least three analysts cut their ratings on Merck's stock, a component of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, while other analysts lowered their target prices for the stock.

“We are downgrading MRK shares to Equal Weight from Overweight based on diminished upside potential from Keytruda, which is by far Merck’s biggest value driver,” Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said in his downgrade note.

Aside from the European withdrawal, Meacham and other analysts also cited delays for another Keytruda study, revealed on Friday morning. Merck said a decision to make overall survival a main goal for a large, pivotal lung cancer trial of Keytruda plus chemotherapy would delay those results until February 2019.

Merck shares fell 5.6 percent to $54.95 on Monday, touching their lowest point since May 2016. The stock had dropped 6 percent on Friday following the company’s third-quarter results.

The drugmaker said that the cost of a June cyber attack that temporarily crippled manufacturing coupled with lower sales of off-patent products caused its third-quarter revenue to fall 2 percent to $10.33 billion, even as Keytruda sales topped $1 billion for the first time.

The combined, roughly 11-percent two-day decline for Merck shares would be the biggest since February 2009.

Merck’s setback boosted shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), which sells a rival cancer therapy. Bristol-Myers shares were up 1.6 percent.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) opened a public consultation on proposals that would force firms that design risky products to put more cash into the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).

The scheme is funded by a levy on financial firms, with the size of the levy generally corresponding to the size of the firm rather than actual risks it poses.

This year’s levy totals 353 million pounds. Much of the recent pressure on the FSCS has come from claims in the life insurance, pensions and investment advice sectors.

The FCA is proposing to force firms that design financial products to contribute more towards compensation costs stemming from sales through “intermediaries” like financial advisors. The aim is to put pressure on product providers to make sure they scrutinise outside advisors who sell their products.

This and other proposed changes will affect which parts of the financial sector pay into the pot.

“This proposal makes general insurance providers potentially liable for more of the compensation bill than before,” the FCA said.

Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said the FCA’s proposal “gets the balance wrong”.

“Expecting providers to foot the bill for intermediaries they have no control over is entirely misplaced and will continue to be widely opposed by providers,” Evans said.

The watchdog also proposes raising the compensation limit for advisors and debt management claims to 85,000 pounds from 50,000 pounds.

This has been prompted by new “pension freedoms” that allow people to cash in their pension pots and seek advice on putting the money into potentially riskier products, the FCA said.

The FCA issued final rules that come into force in April 2018 following a public consultation launched last December.

New reporting requirements will allow the watchdog to tailor levies to the level of risk from a product or company, if it decided to take this step as part of a “polluter pays” push.

The scheme’s coverage will be extended to some aspects of fund management, and to certain debt management activities for the first time. The Lloyd’s of London insurance market is also forced to contribute to the scheme’s retail pot.

The FCA said it won’t intervene to change professional indemnity insurance coverage terms for advisors, saying the markets is working well.

Instead it is consulting on whether to force advisors to hold capital in trust or obtain a surety bond to cover possible compensation claims.

The watchdog also ditched the idea of bringing the loan-based crowdfunding sector under the FSCS as it was impractical.",UK insurers face bigger compensation pot contribution,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-markets-regulator/uk-insurers-face-bigger-compensation-pot-contribution-idUKKBN1CZ1JI

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now that it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson embraces Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi before a meeting of the Saudi-Iraqi Bilateral Coordination Council in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, October 22, 2017. REUTERS/Alex Brandon/Pool

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

But Goushi Kataoka, a newcomer to the board, may propose ramping up stimulus after dissenting last month to a decision to stand pat on policy, setting back the BOJ’s quest to dial back its massive monetary support, analysts say.

At the two-day meeting ending on Tuesday, the BOJ is set to keep intact a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year bond yield around zero percent.

The market’s focus would be on whether Kataoka will propose expanding stimulus. While any such proposal is likely to be voted down, it may expose a rift in the nine-member board on the future direction of monetary policy.

“If Kataoka proposes additional easing, that would be an important turning point for future debate on monetary policy,” said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.

“The proposal could mark a starting point for shifting the debate within and outside the BOJ, from seeking an exit from easy policy to strengthening stimulus,” he said.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will likely hold a briefing at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision.

In a quarterly review of its projections, the BOJ is seen trimming its inflation forecast for the current year ending in March 2018 from the 1.1 percent it estimated made in July, sources say.

The bank is seen roughly maintaining its price forecasts for fiscal 2018 and 2019, as well as its view that inflation will hit the 2 percent target by March 2020, they said.

The BOJ currently projects inflation will hit 1.5 percent in fiscal 2018 and 1.8 percent the following year.

Japan’s economy expanded at an annualized 2.5 percent in the second quarter as consumer and corporate spending picked up, with steady growth likely to be sustained in coming quarters.

But core consumer prices rose just 0.7 percent in September from a year earlier, well below the BOJ’s target, keeping the bank under pressure to maintain ultra-easy policy even as its U.S. and European peers begin to scale back their stimulus.",BOJ set to hold fire; focus on dissenter's stimulus preference,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-boj/boj-set-to-hold-fire-focus-on-dissenters-stimulus-preference-idUSKBN1CZ2PL

The Cupertino-based company does not provide pre-order figures on iPhones, leaving investors and analysts in the dark in trying to track output through research with its suppliers, consumer surveys and other industry indicators.

But positive commentary from analysts on Monday signaled strong demand for the pricey device with pre-orders starting this past Friday.

Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results this Thursday. The company provides sales figures in its results.

Since the launch of new iPhones on Sept.12, the stock had fallen 2.5 percent until last Thursday’s close. They rebounded on Friday after Apple said pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were “off the charts”.

The stock climbed to $168.07 earlier in the session, adding nearly $26 billion to its market cap and inching it closer to becoming the first company with a trillion dollar valuation. Shares pared gains and were up 1.9 percent at $166.15 mid-day.

Daniel Ives, a well-known sector analyst, raised his forecast on Monday for pre-orders by 10 million, and several other analysts talked up sales over the next year.

In a note, Ives of research house GBH Insights, raised his pre-order demand expectations for the iPhone X to 50 million units from 40 million, calling the first stage of the iPhone X release a “stellar success”.

“With the official launch of iPhone X in Apple retail stores slated for this Friday, Nov. 3, we anticipate very high demand globally with limited supply of iPhone X on hand,” Ives said.

Jeffrey Kvaal from brokerage Nomura Instinet, said Apple and U.S. wireless carriers’ pushing out of delivery times for iPhone X orders to 5-6 weeks was longer than for previous phones and pointed to strong demand.

Asked by Reuters whether production bottlenecks are causing shipment delays, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth responded: “No, there’s no bottlenecks. This is a company that manages the supply chain well.”

However, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, cautioned that the longer wait times for consumers ordering phones may be as much due to the component supply issues, which led Apple to delay the launch of the premium phone until November.

“Although we believe Apple is benefiting from strong demand from the iPhone X, the company is also struggling with supply constraints,” White, who has a buy rating on Apple, said.

“A sound debate around the key driver for the surging shipping lead times can be made by reasonable people. Thus we believe it was important for Apple to highlight the demand side of the equation for the iPhone X.”

Wall Street is bullish on Apple with 31 of 38 brokerages rating the stock “buy” or higher. Their median price target of $180 projects a market cap of nearly $930 billion for the iPhone maker.",Apple touches record as brokerages bullish on iPhone X demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-apple-iphone/apple-touches-record-as-brokerages-bullish-on-iphone-x-demand-idUKKBN1CZ1KN

T-Mobile shares ended down 5.4 percent.
Nikkei also reported that SoftBank would inform Germany’s Deutsche Telekom that it was calling off the deal talks, but sources who spoke to Reuters could not confirm this.
Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank declined to comment.","(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE) have reached an impasse in their talks to merge Sprint Corp (S.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) over how many shares each would hold in the combined company, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.

In a board meeting at Japan’s SoftBank on Friday, several directors expressed doubts about giving up control of Sprint in any deal, the sources said, the latest twist in on-and-off talks to unite the two U.S. wireless carriers that began earlier this summer.

According to tentative deal terms that Reuters was first to report last month, SoftBank and other Sprint shareholders would have received close to 40 percent or a little more of the combined company.

The holdup in negotiations could torpedo plans to merge Sprint and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom, into a single carrier with more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N).

It could also damage the dealmaking credentials of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who has raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, and uses his image as a reliable counterparty to clinch deals.

If talks fall apart, it would be the second time an attempted merger of Sprint and T-Mobile has failed. The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014, but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

EXPLORING OPTIONS

Industry watchers had long expected Sprint and T-Mobile to attempt another deal, especially after a quiet period associated with a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves concluded in April, freeing up companies in the telecom industry to discuss mergers and acquisitions.

But no deal was announced immediately following the conclusion of the restriction on merger talks, and both Sprint and T-Mobile said they were open to exploring other options. A source told Reuters in July that SoftBank was considering an acquisition offer for Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) in a deal where it would combine the cable company with Sprint.

Sprint is in the middle of a turnaround plan and has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs. But industry analysts have expressed concern that the company, weighed down with total debt of $38 billion, has few financial options. Even though its customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by heavy discounting.

Sprint’s junk bonds were among the hardest hit in Monday afternoon trading, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters capital markets news service.

Claure said in August that while Sprint could sustain itself, cost savings from a transaction were significantly better than remaining a standalone entity. Analysts have estimated a deal could result in more than $30 billion in savings.

Sprint shares fell as much as 13 percent on Monday after Nikkei first reported that SoftBank was doubting the deal, and ended down 9.3 percent. T-Mobile shares ended down 5.4 percent.

Nikkei also reported that SoftBank would inform Germany’s Deutsche Telekom that it was calling off the deal talks, but sources who spoke to Reuters could not confirm this.

As of late Monday, T-Mobile still considered the negotiations with Sprint to be active, according to the sources.

Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank declined to comment.

DUE DILIGENCE ALMOST COMPLETE

The due diligence between T-Mobile and Sprint was almost complete as of last week, and the focus had shifted to working out a business plan for the combined company as well as an integration strategy, sources had told Reuters.

Even so, it was not clear that U.S. regulators would clear a deal between the two carriers.

Analysts have expected consolidation in the U.S. wireless industry to ease pricing pressure in the market, which could benefit AT&T and Verizon, who have lost share to their smaller rivals. Cable companies Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) are also entering the market with wireless service on Verizon’s airwaves.

“With no merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as the entrance of Comcast and Charter into wireless, we expect Verizon to have a difficult run going forward,” said Philip Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a research note. Verizon shares closed down 2.1 percent.

“Sprint as well could struggle to maintain positive subscriber momentum as cable enters, making its balance sheet look unsustainable.”

Shares in satellite television provider Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), which has been widely considered a potential partner for T-Mobile or Sprint because of its spectrum holdings, closed up 4 percent.","SoftBank, Deutsche Telekom hit wall in Sprint, T-Mobile talks: sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile-us/softbank-deutsche-telekom-hit-wall-in-sprint-t-mobile-talks-sources-idUKKBN1CZ24M?il=0

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Amina Okuyeva and Adam Osmayev were in a car that was shot at from bushes near a railway crossing on the outskirts of the capital, interior ministry advisors Anton Gerashchenko and Zoryan Shkiryak said in separate posts on Facebook.

The attack follows a vehicle bombing in Kiev last Thursday, in which two people were killed and three wounded, including Ihor Mosiychuk, a member of the populist opposition Radical Party.

Okuyeva had links to Mosiychuk, having once worked for him in an advisory role.

“As a result of the injuries she sustained, Amina died. Adam Osmayev was wounded, but will live. I just spoke to him on the telephone,” Gerashchenko said.

The incident is the second attempt this year on the life of Osmayev, from Russia’s mainly Muslim Chechnya region. In June, he survived an attack by a gunman, who was in turn shot and wounded by Okuyeva.

Gerashchenko and Shkiryak did not suggest a motive for the latest incident.

SPATE OF BOMBINGS

Mosiychuk has blamed Russia for last week’s bombing, while Ukrainian police have said Russian involvement is one of the possible motives being investigated.

Russia has dismissed the accusations as a product of anti-Russian sentiment in Ukraine.

Relations between Kiev and Moscow collapsed in 2014 after Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and backed a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukrainian regions.

Russian authorities accuse Osmayev of being part of a 2012 plot by Islamist rebels to kill Putin with a bomb in central Moscow.

Osmayev and Okuyeva are well-known figures in Ukraine, having served as volunteers for the Ukrainian military in the fight against pro-Russian rebels.

Moscow has fought two wars with separatists in Chechnya since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The region is now broadly under the control of Moscow, but Chechens are known to have fought both for the pro-Russian rebels and for the Ukrainian army in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Since fighting broke out in the east in 2014, the number of incidents involving explosives outside the conflict zone has increased.

The bemused bovine and camera-wielding humans stared at each other through a chain-link fence for several minutes, according to live news video.

At other times the beast wandered curiously around the 526-acre (212-acre) Prospect Park, the largest in the borough of Brooklyn, and the artificial turf field normally used for human sporting events.

Officers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.

Police eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of baseball field’s bench area after an officer appeared to fire a tranquilizer dart at it.

Officers then seemed content to let the cow roam between cars, waiting for the drug to take effect before they were able to rope the beast and load it into an NYPD horse trailer.

It was not clear where the beast came from or how it got lost. Police said they would turn it over to the animal control department after they caught it.

The chase drew torrents of posts on social media, many featuring groan-inducing puns.

Burnley moved up to seventh in the Premier League after a 74th minute strike from Irish midfielder Jeff Hendrick gave them a 1-0 win over Newcastle United at Turf Moor on Monday.

Their fourth win of the campaign moves Burnley level on 16 points with Liverpool while promoted Newcastle slip to ninth but it was a game which most neutrals will quickly forget.

On a cold night in East Lancashire, neither side were able to find their rhythm and for a large part of the game a goalless draw looked the most likely outcome.

Burnley, without club record signing Chris Wood who was sidelined by a hamstring injury, began brightly with Jack Cork and Steven Defour controlling the centre of midfield as the Clarets enjoyed plenty of early possession.

But Newcastle gradually grew into the game and fired an early warning shot in the 17th minute when Jonjo Shelvey warmed the hands of Burnley keeper Nick Pope after being set up by Christian Atsu.

There was little to excite the crowd in the opening 45 minutes but right after the interval Spaniard Ayoze Perez went close for Newcastle with a curling effort from the left that Pope did well to push around the post.

Burnley responded by taking a firm grip on proceedings in midfield with Cork influential with his incisive passing and vision, although too often lone striker Ashley Barnes was either isolated or not given effective service.

Cork was the creator when Burnley finally broke the deadlock. The former Swansea City midfielder’s low shot was parried by keeper Rob Elliot and Johann Berg Gudmundsson pounced on the loose ball, swinging a low cross to the back post where Hendrick controlled the ball and converted.

The Magpies went close to an equaliser when Spanish forward Joselu screwed a shot just wide of Pope’s right-hand post and manager Rafa Benitez threw on Dwight Gayle as an extra striker.

The home side’s Barnes then nearly got some reward for his hard work with a low effort which Elliot had to tip wide.

Human rights advocates are warning of a looming humanitarian crisis in the stand-off between detainees of the Manus Island Centre and authorities as the Oct. 31 deadline to close the Australian-funded camp arrived.

Lawyers for some 600 men who are refusing to relocated in two other facilities in PNG, citing concerns about violent reprisals from the local community, plan to file a last-minute lawsuit on Tuesday seeking an injunction to prevent the camp’s closure.

The Manus centre has been a key plank of Australia’s controversial “Sovereign Borders” immigration policy. The country refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, detaining them in camps in PNG and Nauru in the South Pacific. The United Nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centres.

Nick McKim, a senator with the Australian Greens Party who is on Manus, said that authorities had cut power to the centre on and off overnight in a bid to encourage the men to leave. Electricity, food and water supplies are all due to cease on Tuesday and PNG has sent paramilitary services to oversee the closure.

“This is a breach of human rights,” McKim told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. “They remain Australia’s responsibility and the U.N. has repeatedly confirmed that.”

PNG’s High Court ruled last year that the Manus centre, first opened in 2001, was illegal. Closed between 2008 and 2011, the centre reopened in 2012 after a rise in the number of boat arrivals to a peak of 300 in 2013, carrying more than 20,500 people. Two years later, the Australian government announced that boat arrivals had stopped. [nL4N1M05PI]

PNG Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas warned late on Sunday that Australia will not be allowed to walk away from legal, financial and moral responsibility for the men.

Australia has already said it would spend up to A$250 million ($195 million) to house the men for the next 12 months. Just under 200 men have already been moved. [nL4N1MY05Y]

The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of refugees as part of a refugee swap deal.

The United States has agreed to take up to possibly 1,250 refugees from Australia’s two Pacific detention centres, but so far only 25 men from Manus have been resettled. In exchange, Australia said it will resettle Central American refugees.

Australia has said those detainees not resettled in the United States will be allowed to stay in PNG or Nauru. But nearly all have refused invitations to settle permanently in both locations. Thomas said PNG will not force anyone to remain.

Powered by a lightning 51 off 24 balls by Shoaib Malik and a bowling attack led by paceman Mohammmad Amir, the hosts made sure the fans would enjoy a night to remember as Pakistan finally hosted an international cricket fixture on home soil after being shunned by foreign teams for eight years due to security risks.

Pakistan’s isolation began when a 2009 militant attack on the Sri Lankan team’s bus in Lahore left six security personnel and two civilians dead while six players were injured.

Since then, Pakistan have been forced to play designated ‘home’ matches primarily in the United Arab Emirates.

“I’d like to thank the Sri Lankan team... this is something we have missed for many years,” Malik said after picking up the man-of-the-match award.

“Thanks for inviting us, we really love you guys,” said Sri Lanka captain Thisara Perera, whose side were beaten 3-0 in the series with the first two matches having taken place in Abu Dhabi.

After Sunday’s game, jubilant Pakistani fans exiting the stadium danced and played drums on the streets of Lahore.

“I cannot forget that horrible day when the Sri Lankan team was attacked,” said cricket enthusiast Altaf Akram.

“They have taken a big step. All Pakistanis welcome the Sri Lankans ... who are (now) heroes of Pakistan.”

Security for Sunday’s match comprised 16,000 police officials and over 250 surveillance vehicles deployed around Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium, a police official said.

“Police have taken unprecedented security measures for (the) match,” Deputy Inspector General Haider Ashraf told Reuters, adding that aerial surveillance and CCTV cameras were also being utilised.

“Police snipers have been deployed at all high buildings around Gaddafi Stadium,” he added.

Pakistan officials hope Sunday’s match will encourage other countries to send their teams by next year.

West Indies have already committed to a tour although the dates have yet to be finalised, cricket board chairman Najam Sethi told Reuters.

Plans to bring cricket to other Pakistani cities are also underway with four domestic T20 fixtures from the Pakistan Super League (PSL) competition planned in southern metropolis Karachi.

Ele e três outras crianças foram selecionadas para libertar uma pomba da paz durante a cerimônia, mas Werá rompeu com o protocolo e também ergueu um cartaz vermelho e preto com os dizeres “Demarcação Já!”.

Ele levou o cartaz escondido na cueca, sugestão de líderes indígenas de sua comunidade Krukutu de cerca de 300 membros, que mora na cidade de São Paulo.

“Depois disso comecei a ver que a luta indígena (pela demarcação de terras) é muito importante. Este ato me transformou em um verdadeiro ativista”, disse o jovem de 16 anos à Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Werá, que já havia escrito contos e poesia indígena, começou a compor canções de rap poucos meses depois da cerimônia de abertura do Mundial e se rebatizou como Kunumi MC, o primeiro rapper indígena solo do país.

“Estas canções estão ajudando a levar conscientização sobre a demarcação de terras até entre povos indígenas”, disse Werá.

A demarcação de terras para os 900 mil nativos brasileiros é polêmica. Embora se tenha mostrado que a posse formal de terrenos por parte das cerca de 300 tribos indígenas do país preserve culturas e as florestas tropicais onde muitas delas vivem, planos para alocar novas terras para comunidades aborígenes estão travados há meses.

Líderes indígenas temem que manobras políticas acabem com suas reivindicações. Alguns parlamentares ruralistas poderosos propuseram mudanças no processo de demarcação de terras, incluindo a abertura de reservas indígenas a empresas mineradoras.

De acordo com dados de outubro do grupo de ativistas Conselho Indigenista Missionário (Cimi), ligado à Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil, existem 33 propostas que ameaçam os direitos indígenas no Congresso Nacional.

Destas, 17 estão ligadas à demarcação, incluindo uma que pede a permissão de exploração de recursos naturais em terra indígena e um novo arcabouço para o processo de demarcação de terras, segundo a Cimi.

Uma das propostas mais controversas é transferir do governo federal para o Congresso toda a responsabilidade da tomada de decisões ligada à demarcação de terras indígenas.

Raising rates now would be the biggest call on monetary policy Carney has made as governor, and may shape his legacy.
Two policymakers voted for a rate rise, and a majority of the others said they expected to do so “over the coming months”.
Most do not expect another one next year and 70 percent said even one rate rise would be a mistake.
“If he presides over a tightening of monetary policy and it slows down the economy, that’s what he will be remembered for,” McCaughan said.","LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to step into the unknown on Thursday, when it is expected to raise interest rates for the first time since 2007 at a time when growth appears weaker than before any other rate rise of the past 20 years.

FILE PHOTO: People walk past the Bank of England in London, Britain, October 17, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay

Having cut rates to a record low 0.25 percent in August 2016 after Britons voted to leave the European Union, the BoE is now correcting course and falling in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which are either raising rates or scaling back stimulus.

Whereas the United States and the euro zone are enjoying robust growth, however, Britain’s economy has grown at its slowest pace in more than four years over the past 12 months.

Quarterly growth of 0.4 percent offers the weakest backdrop to any rate rise since the BoE became independent in 1997.

True, inflation is at a five-year high of 3.0 percent, a full percentage point above the BoE’s target, but that is mainly because the pound is an average 11 percent weaker against the currencies of Britain’s main trading partners since the Brexit vote.

The BoE has often overlooked past spikes in inflation if they were caused by currency fluctuations that were deemed to be temporary.

Inflation is set to fall this time too, but only slowly, as the BoE judges domestic inflation pressures are pending.

Partly due to stagnant productivity since the 2008 financial crisis - and partly due to concerns about the effect of Brexit on immigration, trade and investment - BoE Governor Mark Carney thinks the economy cannot grow as fast as it has in the past without generating excess inflation.

“We’re in a new paradigm,” says George Buckley, an economist at Nomura who was one of the first to sense a change at the central bank earlier this year, when most economists were saying they did not expect rates to rise until 2019.

Raising rates now would be the biggest call on monetary policy Carney has made as governor, and may shape his legacy.

Carney has faced criticism from economists who say his past guidance on monetary policy has been unhelpful, and from Brexit supporters who say he is too focused on the risks of leaving the EU. But until recently his broad approach to interest rates has been fairly uncontroversial.

For most BoE watchers, the likelihood of a rate rise only became clear in September, when minutes of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee’s meeting that month showed underlying price pressures were no longer a minority concern.

Two policymakers voted for a rate rise, and a majority of the others said they expected to do so “over the coming months”.

RAISING RATES “MAD”

Almost all economists polled by Reuters last week expect the BoE to raise interest rates to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent on Thursday. Most do not expect another one next year and 70 percent said even one rate rise would be a mistake. The latter view is common in markets, too.

“Personally, I think it would be mad,” Jim McCaughan, chief executive of Principal Global Investors, which manages $430 billion of assets, told Reuters earlier this month.

“You’d be tightening at a time of economic softness to defend against a weakness in sterling that you need (to boost exports).”

The BoE says its policy decisions are not driven by exchange rates. When Carney gives his news conference at 1230 GMT on Thursday, he is likely to focus on a 42-year low in unemployment and how it heralds more upward pressure on wages and inflation.

The BoE has been here before, however. Unemployment has repeatedly fallen further than the BoE forecast in recent years, while wage growth has remained stubbornly around 2 percent, half the 4 percent rate associated with pre-crisis rate rises.

Investors will be keen to glean what is meant in practice by the BoE’s long-standing stated expectation that it will only raise rates “at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”.

Markets have priced in an almost 90 percent chance of a rate rise on Thursday, but then expect the BoE to wait until late 2018 before raising again, Nomura’s Buckley said.

He said that was probably too long for the BoE’s tastes. On the other hand, however, Carney will not want to box himself in or lead the wider public to believe he plans to return rates to their pre-crisis level of around 5 percent.

Economists do not expect one or two rate rises will hurt growth much unless businesses or the public think many more will come and curb spending as a result.

BoE forecasts showing inflation is still expected to exceed its target even after three years might be the clearest sign that the BoE thinks faster rate rises are needed, Buckley said.

Either way, the stakes are high both for the BoE and its governor, who has said he will step down at the end of June 2019.

“If he presides over a tightening of monetary policy and it slows down the economy, that’s what he will be remembered for,” McCaughan said.",Bank of England set for step into unknown with first rate hike since 2007,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe/bank-of-england-set-for-step-into-unknown-with-first-rate-hike-since-2007-idUKKBN1CZ1XF

The Cupertino-based company does not provide pre-order figures on iPhones, leaving investors and analysts in the dark in trying to track output through research with its suppliers, consumer surveys and other industry indicators.

But positive commentary from analysts on Monday signaled strong demand for the pricey device with pre-orders starting this past Friday.

Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results this Thursday. The company provides sales figures in its results.

Since the launch of new iPhones on Sept.12, the stock had fallen 2.5 percent until last Thursday’s close. They rebounded on Friday after Apple said pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were “off the charts”.

The stock climbed to $168.07 earlier in the session, adding nearly $26 billion to its market cap and inching it closer to becoming the first company with a trillion dollar valuation. Shares pared gains and were up 1.9 percent at $166.15 mid-day.

Daniel Ives, a well-known sector analyst, raised his forecast on Monday for pre-orders by 10 million, and several other analysts talked up sales over the next year.

In a note, Ives of research house GBH Insights, raised his pre-order demand expectations for the iPhone X to 50 million units from 40 million, calling the first stage of the iPhone X release a “stellar success”.

“With the official launch of iPhone X in Apple retail stores slated for this Friday, Nov. 3, we anticipate very high demand globally with limited supply of iPhone X on hand,” Ives said.

Jeffrey Kvaal from brokerage Nomura Instinet, said Apple and U.S. wireless carriers’ pushing out of delivery times for iPhone X orders to 5-6 weeks was longer than for previous phones and pointed to strong demand.

Asked by Reuters whether production bottlenecks are causing shipment delays, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth responded: “No, there’s no bottlenecks. This is a company that manages the supply chain well.”

However, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, cautioned that the longer wait times for consumers ordering phones may be as much due to the component supply issues, which led Apple to delay the launch of the premium phone until November.

“Although we believe Apple is benefiting from strong demand from the iPhone X, the company is also struggling with supply constraints,” White, who has a buy rating on Apple, said.

“A sound debate around the key driver for the surging shipping lead times can be made by reasonable people. Thus we believe it was important for Apple to highlight the demand side of the equation for the iPhone X.”

Wall Street is bullish on Apple with 31 of 38 brokerages rating the stock “buy” or higher. Their median price target of $180 projects a market cap of nearly $930 billion for the iPhone maker.",Apple touches record as brokerages bullish on iPhone X demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CZ21H-OCABS

The Washington Post reported last week that Marc Elias, a lawyer for 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Clinton, used campaign funds to hire Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier. Committees in both chambers of Congress have been investigating the origin and contents of the document.

John Podesta, who was Clinton’s campaign chairman, and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was the head of the Democratic National Committee at the time, as well as Elias “absolutely need to be recalled“ to testify,” Collins said in an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

But certainly, it’s worth additional questioning of those two witnesses. And the lawyer; absolutely, he more than anyone.”

It has been widely reported that supporters of Republican Jeb Bush, a primary opponent of Trump, initially paid for the firm’s research. Perkins Coie, Elias’ law firm, confirmed on Tuesday that it had hired Fusion GPS in April 2016.

“His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,” Mujahid said in a statement.

“We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” he said.

King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital.

Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.

The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.

Derna has long been under siege by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which has occasionally carried out air strikes against the city. Military officials declined to comment on the strikes.

The attacks on Monday continued for around an hour and hit the Dahr al-Hamar district in Derna’s south and Al Fatayeh, a hilly area about 20 km (12 miles) from the city, a resident said.

At least 17 people were wounded, according to the medical source, who said all the victims appeared to be civilians.

Derna is a coastal city about 265 km (165 miles) west of the Egyptian border. It is controlled by a coalition of Islamist militants and former rebels from Libya’s 2011 uprising known as the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC).

The move to find alternatives to pre-trial detention includes easing onerous bail conditions that disproportionately affect minorities and indigenous people.

“People should not be denied bail by the simple virtue of their disadvantage,” Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said at a news conference.

In Ontario, people in custody are usually only released if they have a surety - a relative or close friend who pledges assets and supervises the accused while they await trial.

Lawyers, judges and criminologists have said sureties penalize people who are poor or whose communities are heavily policed.

Naqvi said Crown prosecutors must use sureties less often and impose bail conditions more judiciously.

In the past year Ontario has expanded “bail bed” programs, which give people a place to stay, and bail verification programs, which require the person to check in with a case worker regularly.

Ontario’s previous directive to prosecutors was more focused on risk-aversion, citing high-profile cases where people committed murder while on bail. The new one tells prosecutors that under Canada’s Criminal Code an accused person’s unconditional release should be the default.

Toronto civil rights lawyer Anthony Morgan said the new directive should more explicitly address the disadvantages faced by black accused people instead of lumping groups together.

“It doesn’t address the particularities of the longer stays, of the harsher treatment, of the specific stereotypes and biases against African-Canadians that lead to the outcomes that we are seeing,” he said. “Not all...communities are disadvantaged in the same way.”

Ontario is one of several Canadian provinces reviewing backlogged criminal justice and bail systems in the wake of multiple Supreme Court rulings that have found them too slow to process cases and too restrictive when it comes to releasing them before trial.

The move followed twin truck bombings on Oct. 15 that killed more than 350 people in the city, in the deadliest attack in the history of the Horn of Africa nation.

Though the Islamist militant group al Shabaab did not claim responsibility for that attack, the method is one it has often used.

“Trucks and tankers cannot pass ... from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm. This is to ensure security and (to offer) a solution to the complaints of the public,” Tabid Abdi, the capital’s mayor, said in a statement.

“Any truck or tanker driver who does not comply will be fined $1,000.”

Further underlining the Somali capital’s security woes, at least 29 people were killed on Sunday during a 12-hour siege at a Mogadishu hotel, in an attack claimed by al Shabaab. The government sacked two top security officials.

“They had the uniforms of security forces, even though they did not have ID cards,” Information Minister Abdirahman Omar Osman told Reuters.

Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel.

Al Shabaab aims to topple the government in Mogadishu and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. The country has been at war since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other.

Though it has lost large swathes of territory to African Union peacekeepers, the group’s attacks have grown in frequency and size, as a 22,000-strong peacekeeping force prepares to begin withdrawing.","Somalia's capital restricts movement of trucks, tankers after attacks",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CZ15T-OZATP

SBI, which accounts for more than a fifth of India’s banking assets, has a total loan exposure of about 120 billion rupees to the solar sector, excluding the latest loans, Chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters on Monday.

Renewable energy is being seen as a growth sector for India, a signatory of the Paris climate accord, with an ambitious plan to raise renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022, from 57 GW currently. Of that, solar is estimated to account for 100 GW.

“We are comfortable with the sector because at least many risks which are normally associated with thermal power projects are not there,” Kumar said. “Only thing is we have to see the commercial viability apart from the usual credit due diligence.”

Loans to traditional coal-fired power plants are the second biggest contributor to Indian banks’ soured loans, which hit a record $146 billion at end-June.

The six companies that SBI will lend to in the latest round to set up solar projects are JSW Energy, Hinduja Renewables, Tata Renewable Energy, Adani Group, Azure Power, Cleantech Solar and Hero Solar Energy.

SBI’s announcement comes after the Indian government this month unveiled a more than $32 billion recapitalisation of state-run 21 banks including SBI, in a bid to help resolve their soured assets, meet capital ratios mandated by global Basel III banking rules and to kickstart credit growth.

“I made a horrible mistake,” the 31-year-old soldier said during his most extensive comments to date at North Carolina’s Fort Bragg. “Saying I’m sorry is not enough.”

His statements marked the opening of the defense’s case, which suffered a blow earlier in the day when the presiding military judge said President Donald Trump had not damaged Bergdahl’s chances of a fair sentence.

Trump called Bergdahl “a no-good traitor” who should be executed during last year’s presidential campaign, and the defense said more recent remarks by the Republican showed his opinion had not changed.

Army Colonel Jeffery Nance said Trump’s comments during the campaign were “condemning and damning of the accused” but had not influenced the proceedings.

“I am completely unaffected by any comments President Trump has made about Sergeant Bergdahl,” Nance said.

The judge said he would consider the president’s comments as a mitigating factor, however, raising the possibility of a lighter punishment for Bergdahl.

The Idaho native was captured by the Taliban after walking off his combat outpost in Paktika Province in June 2009 and spent the next five years in captivity suffering torture, abuse and neglect.

He was released in a 2014 Taliban prisoner swap brokered by the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama.

Bergdahl testified that his captors locked him in “the cage” after a brief escape. He got little food, water or sleep and was forced to watch beheading videos.

A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday.

It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.

Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges against them in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday.

The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies.

Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office.

Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine.

The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.

A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.

“We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing.

Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign.

Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said the charges against Manafort could put pressure on him to cooperate with the Russia investigation.

In a development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.

Mueller’s office said Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain which stated that he has since “met with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document.

White House spokeswoman Sanders played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election, by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Clinton.

Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

Trump on Monday reiterated his frustration with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” Moscow also denies the allegations.

“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton.

Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.

Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities, the indictment said.

They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said.

The indictment said Manafort owned properties in Manhattan; Brooklyn; the Hamptons; Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Prosecutors said Manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. They also said he had been making payments on four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.

Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman.

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for the Trump administration to avoid interfering with Mueller’s probe.

“The rule of law is paramount in America and the investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded. The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” Schumer said.","Two ex-Trump aides charged in Russia probe, third pleads guilty",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CZ1DV

The chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, Dara Khosrowshahi, arrived in Brazil to lobby against the bill that is due to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday and which threatens the company’s business in a fast-growing foreign market.

Brazil is Uber’s third-largest market, with 17 million users, and the city of Sao Paulo sees more trips on the ride-hailing service than any other city in the world, ahead of New York and Mexico City, according to the company.

A spokesman for the company said the application as it exists could not operate under the new rules, including the use of a taxi license plate on cars owned by Uber drivers.

“The business model we have today would not longer be viable,” Uber’s executive spokesman in Brazil Fabio Sabba told Reuters.

Uber is already battling to keep operating in London after the city’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service and refused to renew its license.

Police said 800 Uber drivers drove through the center of Brazil’s capital Brasilia to protest the bill that many say will put them out of business. Similar protests in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro snarled downtown traffic.

Uber did not organize the drivers’ protests but alerted authorities that they would happen.

“The bill will create so much bureaucracy that it prevents the 500,000 drivers in Brazil from earning income for their families,” Uber said in a statement.

Uber said it has paid 495 million reais ($150 million) in federal and municipal taxes so far this year.

The bill, which has already been approved by the lower house of Congress, would define ride hailing applications as public transport instead of private services and require drivers to get a special permit from city authorities. It would also establish additional regulations and taxes.

If the Senate votes to approve the bill, it will be up to President Michel Temer to sign or veto the legislation or parts of it.

But Constellation Brands, maker of Svedka vodka and Corona beer, just dropped something into that punchbowl. It’s taking the legit ganja party up a notch.

A marijuana leaf is displayed at Canna Pi medical marijuana dispensary in Seattle, Washington, November 27, 2012. REUTERS/Anthony Bolante

The booze company is paying C$245 million ($191 million) for a 9.9 percent stake in Canada’s Canopy Growth, a diversified cannabis firm whose brands include Tweed and Bedrocan. Constellation also received warrants allowing it to increase its share. The deal sent Canopy Growth shares 15 percent higher, giving it a C$2.5 billion market value to make it the big kahuna of the emerging public weed complex.

Though the prevailing assumption had been that cigarette manufacturers would feel most threatened by increased marijuana usage, Constellation has recognized otherwise. Where nicotine may be an addictive everyday substance, the active ingredient in pot, THC, offers something else: a longer-lasting euphoria more akin to the party spirit that Constellation’s core products impart to consumers.

In that sense, Constellation’s deal is almost entirely defensive. The $200 billion American alcohol business faces declining usage in part because of rising marijuana consumption, as Cowen & Co researchers pointed out in a 100-page report last year. Their analysis argued that alcohol incidence among American males had fallen 2 percent over the past decade, while weed tokage rose 2.6 percent.

That trend will almost certainly accelerate as more states legalize recreational marijuana. At present, just eight have done so, with another 22 making the plant available for medicinal use.

Facebook gave the details about the reach of Russian posts in written testimony it provided to U.S. lawmakers, which was seen by Reuters.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) separately has found 2,752 accounts linked to Russian operatives, a source familiar with the company’s written testimony said. That estimate is up from a tally of 201 accounts that Twitter reported in September.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google are scheduled to appear before three congressional committees this week on alleged Russian attempts to spread misinformation in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the election, in which President Donald Trump, a Republican, defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, said in the written testimony that the 80,000 posts from Russia’s Internet Research Agency were a tiny fraction of content on Facebook, equal to one out of 23,000 posts.

However, the posts violated Facebook’s terms of service, and any amount of such activity using fake accounts is too much, Stretch wrote.

“These actions run counter to Facebook’s mission of building community and everything we stand for. And we are determined to do everything we can to address this new threat,” he wrote.

The 80,000 posts were published between June 2015 and August 2017. Most of them focused on divisive social and political messages such as race relations and gun rights, Facebook said.

Twitter’s revised estimate of how many Russia-linked accounts were on its service comes a month after an influential Democratic senator, Mark Warner, slammed the company for what he called an insufficient internal investigation.

Twitter has suspended all 2,752 accounts that it tracked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, and it has given U.S. congressional investigators the account names, the source familiar with the company’s written testimony said.

A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday.

It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.

Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges against them in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday.

The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies.

Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office.

Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine.

The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.

A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.

“We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing.

Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign.

Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said the charges against Manafort could put pressure on him to cooperate with the Russia investigation.

”If I were the defense lawyer, I’d be looking into cooperating,” he said.

Nemo, the young dog adopted this year by France’s Emmanuel Macron, was caught on camera relieving himself on a gilded fireplace in the Elysee Palace behind a group of junior ministers meeting with the president.

The footage, captured by French TV channel TF1, showed Nemo interrupting the gathering as the sound of him peeing caused those present to turn around before they started giggling.

“He’s doing something quite exceptional,” a laughing Macron said.

Asked by junior minister for housing Julien Denormandie whether it was something that happened often, Macron added: “No ... you’ve triggered some completely unusual behavior in my dog, sorry.”

Nemo, a black labrador-griffon cross, was adopted by Macron and his wife Brigitte from a shelter home in August.

The multi-party Democratic Unity coalition has had a tough 2017, first failing to bring down Maduro in four months of protests that led to 125 deaths, then losing surprisingly to the Socialist Party in a gubernatorial election earlier this month.

That has left the opposition weakened and divided, and Maduro strengthened, despite growing foreign pressure on his government over alleged rights abuses and corruption, and an unprecedented economic crisis that has millions skipping food.

Three heavyweight movements in the opposition - Justice First, Popular Will and Democratic Action - announced on Monday they did not trust the government-leaning election board sufficiently to participate in the municipal polls in December.

Justice First leader Julio Borges, who also heads the opposition-led congress, said authorities cheated in the 2013 presidential election, denied Venezuelans a recall referendum last year, and rigged the Oct. 15 gubernatorial vote.

So instead of going into another “manipulated” vote, the opposition should focus on demanding reforms to the election board in anticipation of next year’s presidential poll, he said.

“The objective remains getting Nicolas Maduro out of power, and in this struggle, the world is with us,” he told reporters.

To the surprise of some, the Democratic Action party also joined the boycott. Its candidates won four governorships in October’s vote and then infuriated many opposition supporters by swearing loyalty to a pro-Maduro legislative superbody.

Opposition supporters have been split over participating in elections this year. Some say it is the only way to show they are a majority and undermine Maduro, while a growing number argue there is no point in fighting a “dictator” via a system rigged in his favor.

They are pinning their hopes on international action, including U.S. sanctions against Maduro’s government.

Maduro, whose personal popularity has plunged since his 2013 election due to food shortages and runaway inflation, said “sabotage” and “insurrection” were being planned against the mayoral votes.

“I declare myself in battle,” the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez said in a meeting with governors on Monday.

“Those who attack the election system must pay.”

Opposition leaders say the government has long been rigging elections by gross abuse of state funds in favor of socialist candidates, and dirty tricks such the last-minute moving of vote centers in opposition areas for the October ballot.

They have also presented some allegations of ballot-rigging.

However, Maduro insists Venezuela’s system is entirely trustworthy and impossible to hack. It has received international praise in the past, although it was slammed over July’s vote for the Constituent Assembly superbody.

Maduro says the street protests earlier this year were a mask for a U.S.-backed coup plot, and accuses opponents of wanting to oust him by undemocratic means.

Cette loi “pourra entrer en application dès demain”, a dit le chef de l‘Etat lors de la signature, aux côtés du porte-parole du gouvernement Christophe Castaner et du ministre de l‘Intérieur Gérard Collomb.

“Cette loi nous permettra de sortir de l‘état d‘urgence à compter du 1er novembre tout en assurant pleinement la sécurité de nos concitoyens”, a-t-il souligné. Elle “permettra de renforcer nos moyens dans la lutte contre le terrorisme, en particulier dans les lieux qui auront vocation à rassembler du public, lors des marchés de Noël dans quelques semaines”.

“Elle sera évaluée d‘ici deux ans et ce qui aura à être modifié le sera”, a-t-il ajouté.

La loi, définitivement adoptée le 18 octobre par le Parlement, sera promulguée mardi et prendra le relais de l‘état d‘urgence - qui prend fin mercredi soir, a-t-on précisé dans l‘entourage du chef de l‘Etat.

Le texte transcrit dans le droit commun des dispositions de l‘état d‘urgence dans le cadre de la lutte contre le terrorisme, notamment en matière d‘assignation à résidence, de perquisition et de contrôle des personnes. Il élargit également le périmètre des contrôles dans les zones frontalières, aux abords des aéroports, des ports et gares et autorise les préfets à fermer provisoirement des lieux de culte.

UN TEXTE “ÉQUILIBRÉ”, DIT COLLOMB

Promesse de campagne d‘Emmanuel Macron, qui s‘était engagé à sortir de l‘état d‘urgence, le texte suscite de fortes inquiétudes chez les défenseurs des droits de l‘Homme et des libertés individuelles, à l‘image d‘Amnesty France, qui jugent le texte “inefficace” et “liberticide”.

Pour le ministre de l‘Intérieur, le gouvernement a réussi “à avoir un texte équilibré qui prend en compte la nécessité de protéger nos concitoyens et d‘assurer les libertés individuelles au maximum”.

”L‘état d‘urgence était quelque chose de beaucoup plus contraignant“, a souligné Gérard Collomb lors d‘une conférence de presse. ”Pour les gens qui sont aujourd‘hui assignés sur un périmètre, avant ils étaient assignés à résidence et ils devaient pointer trois fois par jours. “Maintenant c‘est le périmètre d‘une ville et ils doivent pointer une fois par jour.”

Dans le cadre de l‘état d‘urgence, onze lieux de culte ont été fermés pour incitation “à la commission d‘actes terroristes” et feront l‘objet d‘un examen “dans les prochains jours”.

Sur la même période, les perquisitions à domicile ont permis la saisie de 625 armes dont 78 armes de guerre, et ont permis de déjouer des attentats, dont un projet d‘attentat pendant la campagne présidentielle, a indiqué Gérard Collomb.

Quarante et une personnes font à l‘heure actuelle l‘objet d‘une mesure d‘assignation à résidence, mesure qui fera l‘objet d‘une évaluation.

Human rights advocates are warning of a looming humanitarian crisis in the stand-off between detainees of the Manus Island Centre and authorities as the Oct. 31 deadline to close the Australian-funded camp arrived.

Lawyers for some 600 men who are refusing to relocated in two other facilities in PNG, citing concerns about violent reprisals from the local community, plan to file a last-minute lawsuit on Tuesday seeking an injunction to prevent the camp’s closure.

The Manus centre has been a key plank of Australia’s controversial “Sovereign Borders” immigration policy. The country refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, detaining them in camps in PNG and Nauru in the South Pacific. The United Nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centres.

Nick McKim, a senator with the Australian Greens Party who is on Manus, said that authorities had cut power to the centre on and off overnight in a bid to encourage the men to leave. Electricity, food and water supplies are all due to cease on Tuesday and PNG has sent paramilitary services to oversee the closure.

“This is a breach of human rights,” McKim told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. “They remain Australia’s responsibility and the U.N. has repeatedly confirmed that.”

PNG’s High Court ruled last year that the Manus centre, first opened in 2001, was illegal. Closed between 2008 and 2011, the centre reopened in 2012 after a rise in the number of boat arrivals to a peak of 300 in 2013, carrying more than 20,500 people. Two years later, the Australian government announced that boat arrivals had stopped.

PNG Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas warned late on Sunday that Australia will not be allowed to walk away from legal, financial and moral responsibility for the men.

Australia has already said it would spend up to A$250 million ($195 million) to house the men for the next 12 months. Just under 200 men have already been moved.

The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of refugees as part of a refugee swap deal.

The United States has agreed to take up to possibly 1,250 refugees from Australia’s two Pacific detention centres, but so far only 25 men from Manus have been resettled. In exchange, Australia said it will resettle Central American refugees.

Australia has said those detainees not resettled in the United States will be allowed to stay in PNG or Nauru. But nearly all have refused invitations to settle permanently in both locations. Thomas said PNG will not force anyone to remain.

The bulk of the detainees come from war-torn countries such as Syria and Afghanistan, and Pakistan, Iran, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.",Asylum seekers defy deadline for closure of Papua New Guinea detention centre,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-australia-asylum/asylum-seekers-defy-deadline-for-closure-of-papua-new-guinea-detention-centre-idUKKBN1CZ2PP?il=0

After sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted hundreds of thousands of women and men to share stories about inappropriate behavior, Britain’s parliament - a bastion of tradition - has been no exception.

Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered an investigation into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys and the opposition Labour Party has suspended one of its lawmakers while it looks into his comments and behavior.

The growing scandal could damage May if there are further allegations against members of her Conservative Party as it relies on a small Northern Irish party for a majority in parliament.

On Monday, May made a rare appearance in parliament to sit beside leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom as she set out the government’s plans to tackle sexual harassment, including measures to enforce a code of conduct and to set up an independent grievance procedure.

“We absolutely are determined to get a grip on this,” Leadsom told parliament, outlining government plans for a “zero-tolerance” approach.

But critics said measures should go further and tackle the culture in parliament, where some female politicians said power was concentrated in lawmakers’ hands and wielded often unchecked over more junior workers.

“There is obviously a problem, it’s a good thing that it’s been exposed,” Labour lawmaker Harriet Harman said. “No one should have to work in the toxic atmosphere of sleazy sexist or homophobic banter.”

THE LIST

The allegations against Weinstein - who denies all accusations of non-consensual sex - has prompted discussion of sexual harassment around the world.

Last week, Labour lawmaker Jared O‘Mara was suspended for reportedly making slurs against a woman he dated and other comments, and at the weekend, Mark Garnier, a junior trade minister, was reported by the Mail on Sunday newspaper to have asked his secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy sex toys and called her “sugar tits”.

On Sunday, May ordered an investigation and wrote to the speaker for advice on changing the culture in parliament, where aides, researchers and secretaries are dependent on their employers, the lawmakers.

“She is deeply concerned at the recent media reports regarding the alleged mistreatment of staff by some members of parliament,” May’s spokesman told reporters.

“She has been clear that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable in any walk of life and she strongly believes it’s important that those working in parliament are treated properly and fairly.”

But in a sign the scandal may widen, British media carried unconfirmed reports that parliamentary aides have drawn up a list of other allegations of inappropriate behavior in parliament. The list could not be confirmed by Reuters.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury. The 12-count indictment included conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, being an unregistered agent of a foreign principal, making false and misleading statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts.

Both pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The Kremlin has denied it meddled in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trump’s favour. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign.

Who is Paul Manafort?

Manafort is a veteran Republican operative who has worked as a Washington lobbyist and international political consultant. His former clients include authoritarian leaders such as the late Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Russian and Ukrainian businessmen and politicians. Manafort was a campaign manager for the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016.

What does the indictment charge they did?

The indictment against Manafort and Gates says they both generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from U.S. authorities between 2006 and through at least 2016.

In June, Manafort and Gates retroactively registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents, in a Foreign Agents Registration Act filing that showed they earned $17.1 million for lobbying on behalf of the Party of Regions, a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, between 2012 and 2014.

The indictment said they concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties. They used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, prosecutors said. The indictment says that more than $75 million flowed through Manafort’s and Gates’ offshore accounts. Manafort, the indictment said, laundered more than $18 million.

The indictment also alleges Manafort and Gates, along with others, conspired to defraud the United States by “impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful governmental functions” of the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department between 2006 and 2017.

Manafort was indicted on nine counts and Gates was indicted on eight counts.

What are Manafort’s links to Trump?

FILE PHOTO: Paul Manafort listens during a round table discussion on security at Trump Tower in the Manhattan borough of New York, U.S., August 17, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri

Manafort joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016 and later became campaign manager, but he was forced to resign in August as questions emerged about his previous work for the political party of the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovich.

Business Insider reported that Manafort and Trump have been connected since the 1980s, when Trump hired Manafort’s lobbying firm to help the Trump Organization.

In 2006, Manafort and his wife bought an apartment in Trump Tower in New York, which Manafort still owns and where he lives when he is in Manhattan, Business Insider reported.

How do the charges relate to Trump?

“It has nothing to do with the campaign or the allegations of collusion with Russia,” said Washington attorney John Dowd, who represents Trump in the Russia probe.

A Trump confidante said: “As it relates to the president, this is nothing. All of the 12 counts of the indictment that came down today, all of it predates their tenure at the campaign.”

The special counsel’s indictment says Manafort and Gates laundered the money through “scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts” from approximately 2006 through “at least 2016.”

Who is Rick Gates?

Rick Gates was Manafort’s deputy and business associate. According to two former high-level Trump staffers, Gates essentially functioned as the Trump campaign manager for more than two months, all while not collecting a paycheck.

The New York Times reported in June that the Trump transition team had been ordered to preserve materials related to ongoing investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. According to the Times, the memo from the special counsel’s office to the former transition team also sought specific information on five people including Manafort and Gates.

According to the indictment, between at least 2006 and 2015 Manafort and Gates acted as unregistered agents of the Ukrainian government, a Ukrainian political party that was headed by Ukraine’s then president, Yanukovich, and Yanukovich himself. The indictment said they both generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work.

Yanukovich has been living in exile in Russia since he was ousted by mass street protests in Kiev in 2014. His departure lit the fuse for Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and a separatist uprising in mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.

The indictment said Gates aided Manafort in obtaining money from offshore accounts and that Gates used that money to pay for personal expenses including “his mortgage, children’s tuition, and interior decorating of his Virginia residence.”

How significant is Gates’ arrest?

The indictment lays out the extent of Gates’ involvement with Manafort going back years. That could potentially open the door for Gates to testify against Manafort and others in the future. David Sklansky, a professor at Stanford Law School and former federal prosecutor, said Gates could feel pressure to cooperate and provide testimony against Trump.",Who are Paul Manafort and Rick Gates?,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-russia-q-a/who-are-paul-manafort-and-rick-gates-idUKKBN1CZ225

The comments presage a fight over what Nasdaq described as $300,000 profit generated each month by the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK.P), a one-time collaboration between a group now owned by Nasdaq, PureShares LLC and ETF Managers Group LLC (ETFMG).

Nasdaq on Thursday sued ETFMG, run by Samuel Masucci, saying it stole the ETF and several others. PureShares also sued ETFMG in May. ETFMG has called both lawsuits frivolous.

Launched in 2014, HACK was among a relatively small group of ETFs that found success despite lacking the support of asset managers like BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group, a handful of which attract the majority of ETF assets.

Smaller companies with ideas for new ETFs can take them to “white-label” providers like Summit, New Jersey-based ETFMG, who help get those products up and running.

The dispute over HACK is revealing the intensity of the steeplechase for a rare blockbuster ETF idea as more investors have flocked to lower-cost index funds. PureShares has said verdicts on the lawsuits could change the way ETF managers do business.

In an interview, Masucci said Nasdaq was failing to actively research and update the index of mostly technology stocks the fund tracked before being removed as index provider this summer. He said that may have caused the fund to lag a rival product, First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR.O), that tracks a different Nasdaq index.

“They were not managing the index as the methodology said they would,” said Masucci. “I don’t think they were doing research on it.”

Nasdaq declined to comment, but said in its complaint that Masucci and ETFMG concocted frivolous reasons to take control of HACK and other ETFs. Nasdaq also said it spent “millions” of dollars between 2012 and 2017 to support the fund and honored its obligations.

HACK delivered a 14.5 percent total return for the year ended July 31, when the Nasdaq index was replaced, short of the 16.9 percent return of CIBR. HACK has continued to lag CIBR in the nearly three months since Nasdaq was removed, though Masucci said it holds stocks that are more “liquid,” easier to buy and sell.

Masucci said Nasdaq also pushed back against plans to cut the fund’s fees, a move that could help the fund perform better.

Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main man-made greenhouse gas, hit 403.3 parts per million (ppm), up from 400.0 in 2015, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said in its annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin.

That growth rate was 50 percent faster than the average over the past decade, driving CO2 levels 45 percent above pre-industrial levels and further outside the range of 180-280 ppm seen in recent cycles of ice ages and warmer periods.

“Today’s CO2 concentration of ~400 ppm exceeds the natural variability seen over hundreds of thousands of years,” the WMO bulletin said.

The latest data adds to the urgency of a meeting in Bonn next month, when environment ministers from around the world will work on guidelines for the Paris climate accord backed by 195 countries in 2015.

The agreement is already under pressure because U.S. President Donald Trump has said he plans to pull the United States out of the deal, which seeks to limit the rise in temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

Human CO2 emissions from sources such as coal, oil, cement and deforestation reached a record in 2016, and the El Niño weather pattern gave CO2 levels a further boost, the WMO said.

As far as scientists can tell, the world has never experienced a rise in carbon dioxide like that of recent decades, which has happened 100 times faster than when the world was emerging from the last ice age.

Scientists know prehistoric levels from tiny air bubbles found in ancient Antarctic ice cores, and they can derive even older data from fossils and chemicals trapped in sediment.

The last time carbon dioxide levels reached 400 ppm was 3-5 million years ago, in the mid-Pliocene era.

“During that period, global mean surface temperatures were 2–3°C warmer than today, ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica melted and even parts of East Antarctica’s ice retreated, causing the sea level to rise 10–20 m higher than that today,” the WMO bulletin said.

Since 1990, the global warming effect of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases has risen by 40 percent. The two other main gases - methane and nitrous oxide - also grew to record concentrations last year, although at a slower rate of increase than carbon dioxide.","Carbon dioxide levels grew at record pace in 2016, U.N. says",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-greenhouse/carbon-dioxide-levels-grew-at-record-pace-in-2016-u-n-says-idUSKBN1CZ0YB

A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday.

It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.

Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges against them in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday.

The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies.

Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office.

Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine.

The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.

A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.

“We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing.

Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign.

Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said the charges against Manafort could put pressure on him to cooperate with the Russia investigation.

”If I were the defense lawyer, I’d be looking into cooperating,” he said.

In a development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.

Mueller’s office said Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain which stated that he has since “met with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document.

White House spokeswoman Sanders played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election, by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Clinton.

Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

Trump on Monday reiterated his frustration with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” Moscow also denies the allegations.

“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton.

Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.

Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities, the indictment said.

They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said.

The indictment said Manafort owned properties in Manhattan; Brooklyn; the Hamptons; Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Prosecutors said Manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. They also said he had been making payments on four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.

Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman.

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for the Trump administration to avoid interfering with Mueller’s probe.

“The rule of law is paramount in America and the investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded. The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” Schumer said.","Two ex-Trump aides charged in Russia probe, third pleads guilty",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CZ1KT-OCATP

The timing is awkward: Baidu’s main search unit has just started to recover after it was hit by a scandal last year over dubious medical advertising. Still, this looks like a one-off.

That is because the recent sale of an unprofitable food-delivery unit has depressed overall sales. But growth in its core business still looks strong. Helped by news feeds on its mobile app, advertising sales in the three months to September topped 20.1 billion yuan, up 22 percent from a year earlier.

Baidu is also more focused than it has been in years. After ill-judged forays into movie ticketing, delivering takeaways and other “online-to-offline” services, Baidu is shifting resources back to the search app. It is slashing other operating expenses, which is helping lift operating margins.

Yet investors remain jumpy. Before Thursday’s sell-off, shares of Baidu had rallied 59 percent this year. In absolute terms that is impressive, but that performance lags arch-rivals Tencent and Alibaba by 24 and 35 percentage points respectively.

Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.

“The weekend pause for thought did us good,” said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed.

But Monday’s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week.

One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. Der Spiegel magazine reported the FDP might head a weakened finance ministry, with key European affairs functions hived off to another ministry.

In a board meeting at Japan’s SoftBank on Friday, several directors expressed doubts about giving up control of Sprint in any deal, the sources said, the latest twist in on-and-off talks to unite the two U.S. wireless carriers that began earlier this summer.

According to tentative deal terms that Reuters was first to report last month, SoftBank and other Sprint shareholders would have received close to 40 percent or a little more of the combined company.

The holdup in negotiations could torpedo plans to merge Sprint and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom, into a single carrier with more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N).

It could also damage the dealmaking credentials of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who has raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, and uses his image as a reliable counterparty to clinch deals.

If talks fall apart, it would be the second time an attempted merger of Sprint and T-Mobile has failed. The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014, but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

EXPLORING OPTIONS

Industry watchers had long expected Sprint and T-Mobile to attempt another deal, especially after a quiet period associated with a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves concluded in April, freeing up companies in the telecom industry to discuss mergers and acquisitions.

But no deal was announced immediately following the conclusion of the restriction on merger talks, and both Sprint and T-Mobile said they were open to exploring other options. A source told Reuters in July that SoftBank was considering an acquisition offer for Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) in a deal where it would combine the cable company with Sprint.

Sprint is in the middle of a turnaround plan and has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs. But industry analysts have expressed concern that the company, weighed down with total debt of $38 billion, has few financial options. Even though its customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by heavy discounting.

Sprint’s junk bonds were among the hardest hit in Monday afternoon trading, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters capital markets news service.

Claure said in August that while Sprint could sustain itself, cost savings from a transaction were significantly better than remaining a standalone entity. Analysts have estimated a deal could result in more than $30 billion in savings.

Sprint shares fell as much as 13 percent on Monday after Nikkei first reported that SoftBank was doubting the deal, and ended down 9.3 percent. T-Mobile shares ended down 5.4 percent.

Nikkei also reported that SoftBank would inform Germany’s Deutsche Telekom that it was calling off the deal talks, but sources who spoke to Reuters could not confirm this.

As of late Monday, T-Mobile still considered the negotiations with Sprint to be active, according to the sources.

Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank declined to comment.

DUE DILIGENCE ALMOST COMPLETE

The due diligence between T-Mobile and Sprint was almost complete as of last week, and the focus had shifted to working out a business plan for the combined company as well as an integration strategy, sources had told Reuters.

Even so, it was not clear that U.S. regulators would clear a deal between the two carriers.

Analysts have expected consolidation in the U.S. wireless industry to ease pricing pressure in the market, which could benefit AT&T and Verizon, who have lost share to their smaller rivals. Cable companies Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) are also entering the market with wireless service on Verizon’s airwaves.

“With no merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as the entrance of Comcast and Charter into wireless, we expect Verizon to have a difficult run going forward,” said Philip Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a research note. Verizon shares closed down 2.1 percent.

“Sprint as well could struggle to maintain positive subscriber momentum as cable enters, making its balance sheet look unsustainable.”

Shares in satellite television provider Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), which has been widely considered a potential partner for T-Mobile or Sprint because of its spectrum holdings, closed up 4 percent.","SoftBank, Deutsche Telekom hit wall in Sprint, T-Mobile talks: sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile-us/softbank-deutsche-telekom-hit-wall-in-sprint-t-mobile-talks-sources-idUSKBN1CZ265?il=0

“War is fundamentally unpredictable,” Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told a Senate hearing about a potential new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, Congress’ most significant step in years toward taking back control of its constitutional right to authorize war.

Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson both said existing authorizations should not be repealed until new ones are in place, and stressed that they believe current AUMFs provide sufficient legal authority for ongoing military action.

“The 2001 AUMF provides statutory authority for ongoing U.S. military operations against al-Qaeda; the Taliban; and associated forces, including against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,” Tillerson said in his opening statement.

Republican and Democratic members of Congress have been arguing for years that Congress ceded too much authority over the deployment of U.S. forces to the White House after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. They are also divided over how much control they should exert over the Pentagon. Repeated efforts to write and pass a new AUMF have failed.

Under the Constitution, Congress, not the president, has the right to declare war.

Concerns intensified this month after four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger and previously over Trump’s talk about dealing with North Korea and an April attack on an airfield in Syria.

Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the foreign relations committee, told the hearing the ambush in Niger shows that U.S. forces “can find themselves in combat at any moment.”

Congress has not passed an AUMF since the 2002 measure authorizing the Iraq War. But the legal justification for most military action for the past 16 years is the older authorization passed days after the Sept. 11 attacks, for the campaign against al Qaeda and affiliates.

Backers of a new AUMF say the 2001 authorization has let presidents wage war wherever they like, without spelling out any strategy for Congress, or the public. For example, Islamic State did not exist when the 2001 AUMF was passed.

“I do not think the American people want the United States conducting a global, endless ‘Shadow War,’ under-the-radar, covert and beyond scrutiny,” said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel.

Mattis told the hearing he was not averse to a new authorization.

“Any new congressional expression of unity, whether or not an AUMF, would present a strong statement to the world of America’s determination,” he said in his opening statement.

But he said imposing limits would help America’s adversaries.

“We are more likely to end this fight sooner if we don’t tell our adversary the day we intend to stop fighting,” Mattis said.

Trump’s fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives but there are deep divisions over any possible new authorization within the party, as well as between Republicans and Democrats.

Many more hawkish Republicans do not want a measure exerting too much control over the Pentagon and say military commanders should decide how to fight America’s enemies.

And some Democrats say they want an AUMF that limits why, where and for how long U.S. forces can be sent to fight.",Trump administration officials oppose limits on war authorization,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-authorization/trump-administration-officials-oppose-limits-on-war-authorization-idUSKBN1CZ0CC

“What the mayor is saying and what we should be doing in Washington is we say to the wealthiest people in this country: ‘You know what, you need to start paying your fair share of taxes,'” Sanders said at a news conference with de Blasio at a Manhattan subway station that began a little late after train delays.

An independent senator from Vermont who espouses democratic socialism, Sanders lost the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton but remains an influential voice on the party’s left wing and repeatedly tops opinion polls of the country’s most well-liked politicians.

De Blasio wants a state tax hike on people making more than $500,000 a year, saying it would generate hundreds of millions of dollars for repairs and upgrades to the century-old subway system.

His plan, to increase the tax rate on an individual’s income above $500,000 to 4.41 percent from 3.876 percent, would also fund half-price bus and subway rides for up to 800,000 of the city’s poorest residents.

ISS also recommended investors cast advisory votes against the pay of top executives of Fox, the owner of the Fox broadcast network, cable channels and a movie studio.

Twenty-First Century Fox’s annual meeting is scheduled for Nov. 15.

Hier zeichnen sich keine Großkonflikte ab: Größter Brocken auf dem Weg zur Jamaika-Koalition dürfte die Forderung der CSU nach einer nochmaligen Ausweitung der Mütterrente sein. Das lehnen CDU, FDP und Grüne angesichts der Kosten von jährlich etwa sieben Milliarden Euro ab. Streitpotenzial lauert auch in Details der Arbeitsmarktpolitik - wie etwa einer Ausweitung der Verdienstgrenze der 450-Euro-Jobs, Mindestlohn, Rückkehrrecht von Teil- auf Vollzeit, Eindämmung befristeter Arbeitsverträge.

MÜTTERRENTE: Gemeint ist damit, dass sich Erziehungszeiten für Mütter mit vor 1992 geborenen Kindern bei der Rente stärker bezahlt machen. Für ab 1992 geborene Kinder erhalten Mütter drei Rentenpunkte gutgeschrieben - das heißt, sie werden so gestellt, als ob sie drei Jahre lang für einen Durchschnittsverdienst gearbeitet hätten. Für vor 1992 geborene Kinder erhalten Mütter nur zwei Rentenpunkte - und das auch erst seit dem 1. Juli 2014. Davon profitieren rund 9,5 Millionen Rentnerinnen. Die CSU will nun einen dritten Rentenpunkt auf für vor 1992 geborene Kinder durchsetzen. Für betroffene Rentnerinnen wären das monatlich pro Kind im Westen 31,03 Euro und im Osten 26,69 Euro mehr. Die jährlichen Kosten lägen bei annähernd sieben Milliarden Euro. Mütterrente erhalten auch Väter, wenn Kindererziehungszeiten ihrem Rentenversichungskonto gutgeschrieben wurden.

MINIJOBS: Union und FDP wollen die Verdienstgrenze für 450-Euro-Jobs erhöhen. Sie war zuletzt am 1. Januar 2013 um 50 Euro gestiegen. Die etwa 7,5 Millionen Minijobber könnten mehr Geld verdienen, von dem sie weder Sozialabgaben noch Steuern abführen müssen. Die Union will die Grenze gemäß der jährlichen Lohnsteigerung anheben. Die FDP will die Grenze auf das 60-Fache des gesetzlichen Mindestlohns festlegen - derzeit rund 530 Euro. Die Grünen wollen Minijobs in sozialabgabenpflichtige Beschäftigung umwandeln.

Für fast 2,7 Millionen Menschen ist der Minijob ein Zubrot zu einem regulären Hauptjob, für etwa 4,8 Millionen ist er die einzige Beschäftigung. Weil für sie Brutto gleich Netto ist, können geringere Stundenlöhne vereinbart werden. So profitieren auch die Arbeitgeber, obwohl sie pauschale Beiträge zur Kranken- und Rentenversicherung und eine pauschale Lohnsteuer zahlen - in der Summe rund 30 Prozent des Lohns. Arbeitsmarktexperten und Gewerkschaften sehen die Minijobs sehr kritisch.

MINDESTLOHN: Am 2015 eingeführten gesetzlichen Mindestlohn von derzeit 8,84 Euro pro Stunde will im Grundsatz keine der Parteien rütteln. Aber die Fußangeln liegen im Detail: Union und FDP wollen “unnötige Bürokratie” (Unions-Wahlprogramm) abbauen. Das zielt auf die Dokumentationspflichten. Danach müssen in einigen, für Schwarzarbeit anfälligen Branchen bis zu einem Monatseinkommen von 2958 Euro Beginn, Ende und Dauer der Arbeitszeit aufgezeichnet werden. Würde die Gehaltsschwelle abgesenkt, wären weniger Beschäftigte betroffen. Bei einem über zwölf Monate nachgewiesenen regelmäßigen Einkommen über 2000 Euro entfällt die Dokumentation bereits seit einer Änderung der Mindestlohnverordnung. Die schleswig-holsteinische Jamaika-Koalition hat vorgeschlagen, für Teilzeitkräfte die Dokumentationspflicht zu reduzieren. Gewerkschaften befürchten dahinter eine Aufweichung des Mindestlohns.

RÜCKKEHRRECHT VON TEIL- IN VOLLZEIT: Union und Grüne haben in ihren Wahlprogrammen ein gesetzlich verbrieftes Rückkehrrecht von Teil- auf Vollzeitjobs in Aussicht gestellt. Die Grünen wollen dazu den bestehenden Rechtsanspruch auf Teilzeit um ein Rückkehrrecht auf den früheren Stundenumfang ergänzen. Darüber hatte sich die Union schon mit der SPD zerstritten[nL8N1IP4VM]: Aus Sicht der Union sollte die befristete Teilzeit für Betriebe ab 200 Mitarbeitern gelten, die SPD wollte die im Teilzeitgesetz verankerte Schwelle von 15 Mitarbeitern gelten lassen. Die FDP steht dem Vorhaben reserviert gegenüber und sieht sich damit aufseiten der Wirtschaft, die eine Gesetzesregelung ablehnt.

ARBEITSVERTRÄGE AUF ZEIT: Bei den rund 3,65 Millionen Neueinstellungen im Jahr 2015 (ohne Lehrlinge und Minijobs) war fast jeder zweite Arbeitsvertrag (45 Prozent) nach Berechnungen von Experten befristet. Oft geschieht dies, weil eine Vertretung in der Elternzeit gesucht wird oder ein anderer sachlicher Grund vorliegt. Aber auch ohne sachlichen Grund können Verträge bis zu zwei Jahre befristet werden. Nach Experten-Berechnungen machen diese Befristungen etwa die Hälfte aller Jobs auf Zeit aus. Grüne würden diese Möglichkeit gerne einschränken. Die Chancen dafür scheinen gering, da große Teile der Union und die FDP dies ablehnen. Etwa 40 Prozent der Jobs auf Zeit führen zu unbefristeter Arbeit. Gemessen an allen Jobs sind etwa neun Prozent der Arbeitsverträge laut Statistikamt befristet.

LANGZEITARBEITSLOSE: Die Union hat das - von niemandem infrage gestellte - Ziel der Vollbeschäftigung mit der Jahreszahl 2025 versehen. Als Messlatte dafür gilt eine Arbeitslosenquote von weniger als drei Prozent. Bei 5,5 Prozent im September müsste sie also halbiert werden. Experten halten mehr Engagement und auch Geld für erforderlich, um vor allem Langzeitarbeitslose in den Arbeitsmarkt zu bringen.

Dazu will die Union Langzeitarbeitslosen “verstärkt die Möglichkeit geben, sinnvolle und gesellschaftlich wertige Tätigkeiten auszuüben”. Die Grünen fordern einen “verlässlichen sozialen Arbeitsmarkt”, auf dem für Langzeitarbeitslose ein sozialabgabenpflichtiger Arbeitsplatz finanziert würde. Die FDP will “statt Arbeitslosigkeit sozialversicherungspflichtige Arbeit für die Betroffenen” unterstützen.

RENTE: In der Rentenpolitik will die FDP erreichen, dass Beschäftigte ab 60 Jahren selbst entscheiden, wie lange sie arbeiten - bei entsprechenden Renten-Abzügen für Arbeitnehmer, die früh ausscheiden. Die Grünen fordern eine Garantierente, auf die ergänzende private und betriebliche Vorsorge nicht angerechnet würde. Die Union will in einer parteiübergreifenden Rentenkommission unter Einbeziehung der Tarifpartner über die Weiterentwicklung der Rente nach 2030 beraten. Bis Ende 2019 sollen Vorschläge vorliegen. “Wir wollen das gesetzliche Renteneintrittsalter nicht erhöhen”, sagte CDU-Chefin und Kanzlerin Angela Merkel im Wahlkampf. Das reguläre Renteneintrittsalter liegt derzeit bei 65 Jahren und sechs Monaten. Bis 2031 steigt die Schwelle auf 67 Jahre.

SOZIALABGABEN: In der Arbeitslosen- und Rentenversicherung können die möglichen Koalitionäre Beitragssenkungen in Aussicht stellen, sofern sie keine großen Mehrausgaben beschließen oder diese aus Steuern finanzieren. Für 2018 ist eine Absenkung des Rentenbeitrags um 0,1 Prozentpunkte in Sicht, die Arbeitgeber und Arbeitnehmer um 1,3 Milliarden Euro entlasten würde. Eine noch stärkere Senkung um bis zu 0,3 Prozentpunkte könnte in der Arbeitslosenversicherung anstehen: Nach derzeitigen Berechnungen steigen die Rücklagen der Bundesagentur für Arbeit bis 2019 auf über 20 Milliarden Euro. Sie wäre damit ausreichend für Krisenfälle gewappnet, so dass eine Beitragssenkung ins Haus stehen könnte.

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney-General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia’s secessionist government and called a snap regional election for Dec. 21, and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Monday’s calm on the streets of Barcelona resolved a weekend of uncertainty during which it was not clear how the region would respond to central control.

“THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON”

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started worked as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices though some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Two hundred thousand public sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and another 100,000 in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. This compared to 41.1 percent in July according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for sacked regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies who called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain’s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country’s rating.",Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/spanish-prosecutor-accuses-sacked-catalan-leader-of-rebellion-idINKBN1CZ0IL

His lavish lifestyle - with homes in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Hamptons, Arlington, Virginia and elsewhere - were detailed in an indictment filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that was revealed on Monday.

The indictment filed by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort “used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States.”

Prosecutors said they found payments by Manafort for four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz among transactions that they alleged came illegally from overseas to avoid paying U.S. income taxes, according to the 31-page court filing.

Prosecutors said they found evidence he bought a condo in a restored red-brick building in New York’s upscale Soho neighborhood for $2.85 million, also from overseas money, most often from Cyprus.

Manafort and associate Rick Gates pleaded not guilty on Monday to money laundering and other charges filed in a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Manafort and Gates both appeared stoic throughout a court hearing on Monday.

Greg Andres, a federal prosecutor on Mueller’s team, said his office had a “difficult time” trying to pin down Manafort’s and Gates’ net worths, making it hard to set appropriate bail arrangements.

Andres said Manafort listed a wide range of net asset values on loans and other financial documents, from as low as $20 million to as high as $100 million. Gates, meanwhile, listed assets as low as $2 million and as high as $30 million.

A federal judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates.

Manafort’s attorney Kevin Downing said on Monday there was no evidence that his client colluded with the Russian government while working for the Trump campaign. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment.

Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

The indictment said both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities.

The indictment said he spent $849,215 in a men’s clothing store in New York and $520,440 at one in Beverly Hills.

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney-General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia’s secessionist government and called a snap regional election for Dec. 21, and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Monday’s calm on the streets of Barcelona resolved a weekend of uncertainty during which it was not clear how the region would respond to central control.

“THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON”

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started worked as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices though some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Two hundred thousand public sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and another 100,000 in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. This compared to 41.1 percent in July according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for sacked regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies who called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain’s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country’s rating.",Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spains-control-over-catalonia-to-be-tested-on-monday-as-work-resumes-idUSKBN1CZ0IP

On October 5, the militant group lost the northern town of Hawija – its last urban stronghold after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul and Tal Afar earlier this year. The brutal battles for these cities have been well documented. Less noticed, however, has been how the near-total defeat of IS is reshaping political and sectarian alliances in the region.

The rise and fall of IS has had a sobering and unifying effect on relationships between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In Iraq, where thousands died in the vicious sectarian war that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, residents of the mainly-Sunni cities of Mosul and Hawija nonetheless jubilantly welcomed the mostly-Shi’ite Iraqi forces who freed the cities from the Sunni extremists of IS. “They helped liberate us,” one Hawija Sunni leader told the New York Times of the fighters. Nor does a Shi’ite backlash against Sunnis seem imminent given Shi’ite recognition of Sunni suffering in the IS-occupied cities.

The IS experience has affected Iranian politics too. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to show a softer attitude toward Sunnis in a rare pronouncement – seen as carrying the weight of a fatwa – publicly prohibiting any discrimination against minorities. Sunnis have fewer rights than Shi’ites in Iran, and Khamenei’s August comment was made in response to an inquiry by Molavi Abdul Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric from Iran's impoverished Sunni-dominated Sistan-Baluchistan province on the Pakistan border. In Syria too, IS's faster-than-expected battlefield defeats suggest that the group does not enjoy much local support among the Sunni tribes and populations it has been ruling for the past couple of years.

The biggest changes can be seen in Iraq, where Shi’ite leaders’ attempts to develop a post-IS foreign policy are driven in part by fear of Iran’s growing influence and in part by the IS-inflicted suffering in Iraq. Many observers believe that the pursuit of sectarian policies at the expense of Iraqi Sunnis – as systematically practiced under the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki – expedited the rise of IS.

The result of the new dynamic is that Iraq’s main Shi’ite leaders are distancing themselves from Iran as they make once-unthinkable overtures to the region’s Sunni Arab bloc. In one of the latest signs of that shift, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi declined Tehran’s official invitation to take part in President Hassan Rouhani’s second-term inauguration ceremony on August 5. Such a refusal would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

Similarly, prominent Shi’ite leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada al-Sadr snubbed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the newly-appointed chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council – a governing body set up to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians over whether planned legislation conforms with Islamic law – during an official visit to Iraq as the envoy of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Sadr said after the meeting that he hoped it was 'the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region.' Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS

Underscoring the point, Baghdad publicly slammed a deal made by Hezbollah, Iran’s chief proxy in the region, to evacuate a group of IS fighters from Lebanon to eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. The Tehran-backed agreement was “unacceptable” and “an insult to the Iraqi people,” Prime Minister Abadi said in August.

Iranian influence on Iraq’s domestic politics is shrinking too. Ammar al-Hakim resigned as head of the Tehran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq – the country’s largest Shi’ite party – a month after a June meeting with Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and an informal advisor to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Hakim promptly went on to form the National Wisdom Movement, a political party to “embrace” all Iraqis.

At the same time, Iran-funded, Shi’ite-dominated militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces are divided over whether they should be integrated into the regular Iraqi army – a measure that would loosen Iran’s foothold in Iraq’s security apparatus – or whether they should remain independent of the Iraqi government. Groups loyal to Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have started taking steps to register with the army; those led by Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization and Qais al-Khazali of Asaib Ahl al-Haq remain in the pro-Iran camp.

Against this backdrop, Iraq is trying to improve its ties with Saudi Arabia. In addition to several recent diplomatic visits between the two countries, including one by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Riyadh, Moqtada al-Sadr – an influential Shi’ite cleric with a large following among Iraq’s urban poor – made rare and well-received visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Sadr issued a statement saying that he was “very pleased with what we found to be a positive breakthrough in the Saudi-Iraqi relations,” and that he hoped it was “the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region."" Sadr’s Aug. 13 meeting with Emirati crown prince Zayed al-Nahayan appeared equally successful. “Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,” Nahyan told Sadr, in a veiled reference to Iran as one of the dividers.

It is clearly in Iraq’s strategic interests to diversify its relationships beyond reflexive sectarian or ideological lines. Improved ties with Riyadh pave the way for Baghdad to receive much-needed financial aid from Saudi Arabia and establish an economic relationship that could help counter the political and military influence established when Iran cultivated Shi’ite proxies to fight U.S.-backed forces in Iraq. The outreach can also signal to Iraq’s Sunni minority that the Baghdad government is not an Iranian stooge.

Iraq’s post-IS foreign policy could have broader regional benefits too. For Riyadh, closer ties with Baghdad can help the Saudi leadership feel less threatened by Iran’s rising influence and the perception that Riyadh’s share of regional power has diminished as a result. That in turn may lead to a thaw in Iranian-Saudi ties and a broader contribution to regional security.

Nonetheless, the fact is that neither Riyadh nor Tehran can achieve sustainable hegemony in the region at the expense of the other.

Ivan Perisic rifled in Inter’s winner as they moved back into second place but it was Verona’s penalty, which took around four minutes to award with the help of the video assistant referee (VAR), which was the talking point of the game.

Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic collided with Verona forward Alessio Cerci as they went for the ball in the penalty area and referee Claudio Gavillucci initially waved play on.

However, when play stopped around 30 seconds later, the referee signalled that he was consulting the VAR.

After a two-minute wait, the referee went to the touchline to look a the monitor himself, returned to the pitch and awarded the penalty, amid angry Inter protests.

Former Italy forward Pazzini, who had been waiting to come on, entered the pitch, went straight to the penalty spot and sent Handanovic the wrong way to equalise in the 59th minute.

However, Inter, who had taken the lead through Borja Valero in the 36th minute, regained the lead eight minutes later when a Verona clearance landed at the feet of Perisic who blasted an unstoppable shot into the net.

“What the mayor is saying and what we should be doing in Washington is we say to the wealthiest people in this country: ‘You know what, you need to start paying your fair share of taxes,'” Sanders said at a news conference with de Blasio at a Manhattan subway station that began a little late after train delays.

An independent senator from Vermont who espouses democratic socialism, Sanders lost the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton but remains an influential voice on the party’s left wing and repeatedly tops opinion polls of the country’s most well-liked politicians.

De Blasio wants a state tax hike on people making more than $500,000 a year, saying it would generate hundreds of millions of dollars for repairs and upgrades to the century-old subway system.

His plan, to increase the tax rate on an individual’s income above $500,000 to 4.41 percent from 3.876 percent, would also fund half-price bus and subway rides for up to 800,000 of the city’s poorest residents.

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.

Trump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)

We know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.

Although Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.

Trump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)

The withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.

While this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.

The problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.

Republican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.

When considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.",Commentary: Blame the Constitution for Trump’s undemocratic executive orders,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-executive-commentary/commentary-blame-the-constitution-for-trumps-undemocratic-executive-orders-idUSKBN1CN2NR

As expected, Menendez and his co-defendant, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, declined to take the witness stand in their defense. Closing arguments were set to begin no earlier than Wednesday morning.

Menendez, 63, is accused of accepting bribes from Melgen, including luxury vacations, private flights and campaign contributions, in exchange for using his political influence to help Melgen in a variety of ways.

Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have told the jury in Newark, New Jersey, that they did nothing wrong and that their actions stemmed from a close, brother-like relationship.

The case could have an outsized effect on Capitol Hill, where Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 edge in the Senate. If Menendez is convicted and either resigns or is expelled before Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s term expires in January, the governor would presumably name a Republican to replace him.

The Democratic candidate to succeed Christie, Phil Murphy, holds a comfortable lead in polls ahead of the state’s gubernatorial election on Nov. 7.

A Republican effort to repeal former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law failed by a single vote in the Senate in July, and the party’s pursuit of tax reform is expected to be similarly hard-fought.

Defense attorneys ended their case on Monday soon after the judge overseeing the trial, William Walls, denied their request to declare a mistrial. The lawyers had argued that Walls unfairly limited the witnesses and evidence they could present to jurors.

Menendez intervened with Medicare officials on Melgen’s behalf after the agency determined the doctor had overbilled it by millions of dollars, according to prosecutors. Melgen was convicted separately earlier this year in Florida of Medicare fraud, though the New Jersey jury has not heard about that case.

In addition, the senator pressed U.S. officials to resolve a port dispute in the Dominican Republic involving one of Melgen’s business ventures and to issue visas for several of Melgen’s foreign girlfriends, prosecutors say.

Among the witnesses who appeared for the defense were two of Menendez’s colleagues: Republican U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham and Democratic U.S. Senator Cory Booker, who is New Jersey’s other senator. Both men testified about Menendez’s good character without reference to the current charges.",Defense rests in Democratic Senator Menendez's bribery trial,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-jersey-menendez/defense-rests-in-democratic-senator-menendezs-bribery-trial-idUSKBN1CZ2ET?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, Dara Khosrowshahi, arrived in Brazil to lobby against the bill that is due to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday and which threatens the company’s business in a fast-growing foreign market.

Brazil is Uber’s third-largest market, with 17 million users, and the city of Sao Paulo sees more trips on the ride-hailing service than any other city in the world, ahead of New York and Mexico City, according to the company.

A spokesman for the company said the application as it exists could not operate under the new rules, including the use of a taxi license plate on cars owned by Uber drivers.

“The business model we have today would not longer be viable,” Uber’s executive spokesman in Brazil Fabio Sabba told Reuters.

Uber is already battling to keep operating in London after the city’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service and refused to renew its license.

Police said 800 Uber drivers drove through the center of Brazil’s capital Brasilia to protest the bill that many say will put them out of business. Similar protests in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro snarled downtown traffic.

Uber did not organize the drivers’ protests but alerted authorities that they would happen.

“The bill will create so much bureaucracy that it prevents the 500,000 drivers in Brazil from earning income for their families,” Uber said in a statement.

Uber said it has paid 495 million reais ($150 million) in federal and municipal taxes so far this year.

The bill, which has already been approved by the lower house of Congress, would define ride hailing applications as public transport instead of private services and require drivers to get a special permit from city authorities. It would also establish additional regulations and taxes.

If the Senate votes to approve the bill, it will be up to President Michel Temer to sign or veto the legislation or parts of it.

Trump announced in July that he would ban transgender people from the military in a move that would reverse Democratic former President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them and halt years of efforts to eliminate barriers to military service based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

The transgender service members sued in August to try to block the ban, which had not yet gone into effect, and U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted them an injunction halting enforcement of it until their case is resolved.

The service members asserted that Trump’s policy violated their rights to due process and equal protection under the law under the U.S. Constitution. Kollar-Kotelly said the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their claim that the ban was unconstitutional because the administration’s reasons for it “do not appear to be supported by any facts.”

After his policy announcement on Twitter, Trump signed a memorandum in August that directed the military not to accept transgender people as recruits and halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgeries for active-duty personnel unless the process was already underway.

The memo called on Defense Secretary James Mattis to submit a plan to Trump by Feb. 21 on how to implement the changes, and the Pentagon has created a panel of senior officials for that purpose. In the meantime, the current policy of allowing transgender people to serve remains in force.

Mattis in June already had delayed allowing transgender recruits to join the U.S. armed forces on July 1 as previously scheduled.

The judge tossed out the suit’s challenge to the sex-reassignment surgery directive, saying none of the plaintiffs had shown they would be impacted by that prohibition.

‘HUGELY IMPORTANT’

“This is a hugely important decision and confirms that transgender people can and should be able to serve in the military if they are qualified to do so,” said the plaintiffs’ lead attorney, Jennifer Levi.

“The court saw through the smoke screens that the government tried to throw up to hide what is actually going on here, which is straight-on bias and prejudice against transgender people,” added Levi, director of the transgender rights project for the anti-discrimination group GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders.

The Justice Department said it was disappointed in the ruling and evaluating its next steps. Spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said the suit was premature because the “Defense Department is actively reviewing such service requirements, as the president ordered, and because none of the plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service.”

Trump’s action appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters. The president in February also rescinded protections put in place under Obama for transgender public school students.

The judge’s action marked the latest legal setback suffered by Trump on policies he has pursued as president. Courts also have blocked Trump’s latest version of a travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries, and dealt him setbacks on policies on so-called sanctuary cities and environmental rules.

The service members who sued Trump, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and military leaders in August had been serving openly as transgender people in the U.S. Army, Air Force and Coast Guard. They said Trump’s ban discriminated against them based on their sex and transgender status.

They also said they relied on the 2016 policy put in place by Obama to reveal they are transgender and called Trump’s reversal unfair, arbitrary and a violation of their privacy rights.

The Trump administration argued that transgender people might harm military unit cohesion and that they suffer medical conditions that could limit their ability to perform duties or deploy.

The judge said the military previously commissioned a study that debunked concerns about unit cohesion, military readiness, or healthcare costs related to transgender troops. That report estimated there were 2,450 active-duty service members and 1,510 in the military reserves.

“In short, the military concerns purportedly underlying the president’s decision had been studied and rejected by the military itself,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote.

Other suits also have been filed against Trump’s ban.","In defeat for Trump, judge blocks transgender military ban",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-transgender/in-defeat-for-trump-judge-blocks-transgender-military-ban-idUSKBN1CZ25E

HSBC said it had resolved the problem, which lasted around 30 minutes and was due to a temporary technical issue.

HSBC customers had also said on Friday they were unable to access online accounts, when many were expecting pay cheques.

The bank said that disruption was caused by a scheduled upgrade which failed to complete properly.

They may be even slower to close that gap if the laudable push for transparency is not backed up by the threat of eventual sanctions.

The government in April gave organisations with at least 250 employees one year to disclose their gender wage gap. By mid-October, less than six months before the deadline, only 2 percent had done so. Extrapolating from such a small sample is difficult but it’s already clear that organisations where women both earn more than men on average and are overrepresented in the top pay quartile are rare. Yellow Dot, which runs nurseries, and The Commission for Equality and Human Rights are among the exceptions.

That tallies with statistics for the whole economy from the national statistics office, which show that men are on average paid nearly a fifth more than women even though the differential is at its narrowest on record. Women are more likely to be employed in low-paid sectors and rack up fewer hours at work. But even stripping out part-time work, the median hourly gap between male and female pay is 9.4 percent.

The idea is that transparency at company level will give women leverage to fight pay inequality. But Austria’s experience suggests otherwise. Its wage gap – one of the highest in Europe – has dropped just 2 percentage points to 21.7 percent since similar rules were introduced six years ago. First, it’s primarily highly-educated women seeking out the data. Second, few companies are doing much about their findings.

Granted, the British data will be published online rather than being held by internal work councils as in Austria. Media scrutiny and competition for the best talent might nudge companies to change. For example, an accounting graduate can now see that PwC offers higher mean wages and bonuses to female employees than rival Deloitte and promotes more women to top posts.

But closing the gender pay gap will also require changes to corporate cultures where men are more likely than women to climb the greasy pole. Governments are becoming more interventionist when companies pollute the environment or fail to pay enough taxes. Pay gaps may be another issue which may be fixed quickest by using sticks rather than carrots.",Breakingviews - UK gender pay equality drive is too easy to skirt,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-pay-breakingviews/breakingviews-uk-gender-pay-equality-drive-is-too-easy-to-skirt-idUKKBN1CZ1WL

Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.

“The weekend pause for thought did us good,” said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed.

But Monday’s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week.

One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. Der Spiegel magazine reported the FDP might head a weakened finance ministry, with key European affairs functions hived off to another ministry.

Negotiators emerged on Monday with a document spelling out areas where they had reached agreement, including commitments to universal gigabit-speed internet by 2025, and spending 3.5 percent of economic output on research and development.

After discussions that ran late into the evening, they also signed up to Merkel’s election campaign pledge of achieving full employment, without giving a specific target date.

Merkel, whose conservatives came first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 national elections must forge a so-called “Jamaica” coalition - named because the three camps’ colors match that country’s flag - that is untested at national level.

A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday.

It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.

Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges against them in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday.

The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies.

Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office.

Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine.

The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.

A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.

“We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing.

Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign.

Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said the charges against Manafort could put pressure on him to cooperate with the Russia investigation.

”If I were the defense lawyer, I’d be looking into cooperating,” he said.

In a development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.

Mueller’s office said Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain which stated that he has since “met with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document.

White House spokeswoman Sanders played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election, by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Clinton.

Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

Trump on Monday reiterated his frustration with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” Moscow also denies the allegations.

“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton.

Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.

Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities, the indictment said.

They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said.

The indictment said Manafort owned properties in Manhattan; Brooklyn; the Hamptons; Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Prosecutors said Manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. They also said he had been making payments on four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.

Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman.

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for the Trump administration to avoid interfering with Mueller’s probe.

“The rule of law is paramount in America and the investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded. The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” Schumer said.","Two ex-Trump aides charged in Russia probe, third pleads guilty",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-russia-manafort/two-ex-trump-aides-charged-in-russia-probe-third-pleads-guilty-idUKKBN1CZ1DV?il=0

Even more important, it could help the firm resist Amazon’s entry into drug distribution, and the unpleasant side effects of transparency and low margins that may follow.

Getting drugs from producers to consumers is a complex and foggy business, with multiple middlemen capturing bits and pieces along the way. Combining CVS and Aetna would create a single business able to negotiate a lower price from a drugmaker, dispense the medicine, and insure customers so they can pay for it.

That could mean savings from fewer administrative staff and combined IT systems. The nation’s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, runs a prescription drug benefit business in-house that has done well. There may be a cost though. Rival insurer Anthem recently partnered with CVS to form a drug-benefit business due to start in 2020. Whether Anthem would want to play ball with Aetna in the picture is a big question.

Yet it’s notable that this overture became public the same day that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch confirmed Amazon had received approval from multiple states to become a wholesale pharmaceutical distributer. Rumor and logic suggest strongly that the retailer will ultimately offer prescriptions online.

That news caused widespread damage to drug middlemen stocks earlier in the day. CVS, for example, saw its shares initially fall up to 6 percent on the news. Currently pharmacy-benefit managers can negotiate discounts with drugmakers in the dark, push customers toward captive pharmacies and extract a profit. It’s one of the reasons why healthcare is so much more costly and complex in America than in most developed countries. Amazon on the other hand, is notorious for disrupting businesses, focusing on customers, and being willing to accept nearly non-existent margins. For CVS, having an insurer steer a lot of customers its way might help neuter the Amazon threat.

Of course, CVS’s strategy may have side effects of its own. U.S. politicians and consumers have become increasingly critical of the high cost and murkiness of drug pricing. Transparency may be coming regardless of what deals are made.",Breakingviews - Aetna bid is a defensive prescription for CVS,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-aetna-bid-is-a-defensive-prescription-for-cvs-idUSKBN1CV3OK

Trump announced in July that he would ban transgender people from the military in a move that would reverse Democratic former President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them and halt years of efforts to eliminate barriers to military service based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

The transgender service members sued in August to try to block the ban, which had not yet gone into effect, and U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted them an injunction halting enforcement of it until their case is resolved.

The service members asserted that Trump’s policy violated their rights to due process and equal protection under the law under the U.S. Constitution. Kollar-Kotelly said the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their claim that the ban was unconstitutional because the administration’s reasons for it “do not appear to be supported by any facts.”

After his policy announcement on Twitter, Trump signed a memorandum in August that directed the military not to accept transgender people as recruits and halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgeries for active-duty personnel unless the process was already underway.

The memo called on Defense Secretary James Mattis to submit a plan to Trump by Feb. 21 on how to implement the changes, and the Pentagon has created a panel of senior officials for that purpose. In the meantime, the current policy of allowing transgender people to serve remains in force.

Mattis in June already had delayed allowing transgender recruits to join the U.S. armed forces on July 1 as previously scheduled.

The judge tossed out the suit’s challenge to the sex-reassignment surgery directive, saying none of the plaintiffs had shown they would be impacted by that prohibition.

‘HUGELY IMPORTANT’

“This is a hugely important decision and confirms that transgender people can and should be able to serve in the military if they are qualified to do so,” said the plaintiffs’ lead attorney, Jennifer Levi.

“The court saw through the smoke screens that the government tried to throw up to hide what is actually going on here, which is straight-on bias and prejudice against transgender people,” added Levi, director of the transgender rights project for the anti-discrimination group GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders.

The Justice Department said it was disappointed in the ruling and evaluating its next steps. Spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said the suit was premature because the “Defense Department is actively reviewing such service requirements, as the president ordered, and because none of the plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service.”

Trump’s action appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters. The president in February also rescinded protections put in place under Obama for transgender public school students.

The judge’s action marked the latest legal setback suffered by Trump on policies he has pursued as president. Courts also have blocked Trump’s latest version of a travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries, and dealt him setbacks on policies on so-called sanctuary cities and environmental rules.

The service members who sued Trump, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and military leaders in August had been serving openly as transgender people in the U.S. Army, Air Force and Coast Guard. They said Trump’s ban discriminated against them based on their sex and transgender status.

They also said they relied on the 2016 policy put in place by Obama to reveal they are transgender and called Trump’s reversal unfair, arbitrary and a violation of their privacy rights.

The Trump administration argued that transgender people might harm military unit cohesion and that they suffer medical conditions that could limit their ability to perform duties or deploy.

The judge said the military previously commissioned a study that debunked concerns about unit cohesion, military readiness, or healthcare costs related to transgender troops. That report estimated there were 2,450 active-duty service members and 1,510 in the military reserves.

“In short, the military concerns purportedly underlying the president’s decision had been studied and rejected by the military itself,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote.

Other suits also have been filed against Trump’s ban.","In defeat for Trump, judge blocks transgender military ban",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-military-transgender/in-defeat-for-trump-u-s-judge-blocks-transgender-military-ban-idINKBN1CZ25M

The Labour Party, which took the helm last week, has taken issue with the fact that the deal is at odds with its plans to ban foreign ownership of existing houses, a key campaign promise.

The 11 TPP members had set a goal of reaching broad agreement on the pact on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam next week and some fear New Zealand’s renegotiation could unravel the agreement.

Trade Minister David Parker told Radio New Zealand that Labour still found the foreign ownership rules “abhorrent”, but that trade officials had told him not all changes would be possible given how late it was in negotiations.

“That doesn’t mean to say we won’t be able to change anything and it doesn’t mean to say that perhaps through mechanisms outside of the TPP we will perhaps be able to fix other things,” Parker said.

His comments suggested the government could instead focus on a change to domestic law to get around the TPP rules, which Parker had flagged as an option the previous day.

Parker added that he would release more details on the “mechanisms” to achieve the foreign housing ban later this week.

Trade experts told Reuters that New Zealand could include housing in the country’s domestic legislation regulating foreign investment, which overrides the TPP.

The TPP currently requires member states to give foreign investors equal treatment to locals unless there are specific exemptions.

The Labour party would like an exemption for existing homes, similar to Australia’s carve out.

New Zealand’s current exception allows it to add a tax to foreigners purchasing homes, but Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said that would not work and an outright ban was needed.

Ardern’s government campaigned to restrict foreign buyers to reduce demand as the country tackles what Labour says is a housing crisis left unresolved by the previous government.

Parker on Tuesday would not confirm whether New Zealand was willing to walk away from the TPP over the issue, saying that would undermine the country’s negotiating position.

The chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, Dara Khosrowshahi, arrived in Brazil to lobby against the bill that is due to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday and which threatens the company’s business in a fast-growing foreign market.

Brazil is Uber’s third-largest market, with 17 million users, and the city of Sao Paulo sees more trips on the ride-hailing service than any other city in the world, ahead of New York and Mexico City, according to the company.

A spokesman for the company said the application as it exists could not operate under the new rules, including the use of a taxi license plate on cars owned by Uber drivers.

“The business model we have today would not longer be viable,” Uber’s executive spokesman in Brazil Fabio Sabba told Reuters.

Uber is already battling to keep operating in London after the city’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service and refused to renew its license.

Police said 800 Uber drivers drove through the center of Brazil’s capital Brasilia to protest the bill that many say will put them out of business. Similar protests in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro snarled downtown traffic.

Uber did not organize the drivers’ protests but alerted authorities that they would happen.

“The bill will create so much bureaucracy that it prevents the 500,000 drivers in Brazil from earning income for their families,” Uber said in a statement.

Uber said it has paid 495 million reais ($150 million) in federal and municipal taxes so far this year.

The bill, which has already been approved by the lower house of Congress, would define ride hailing applications as public transport instead of private services and require drivers to get a special permit from city authorities. It would also establish additional regulations and taxes.

If the Senate votes to approve the bill, it will be up to President Michel Temer to sign or veto the legislation or parts of it.

Gigaba shocked markets on Oct. 25 by flagging sharply weaker growth expectations, wider deficits and rising government debt.

The comments by Moody‘s, which along with S&P Global is expected to review South Africa’s credit ratings next month, come after Fitch criticised Gigaba’s budget speech for shifting away from fiscal consolidation efforts.

The rand and government bonds were pummelled last week by speculation that Moody’s and S&P could downgrade the local-currency rating to sub-investment, or “junk”, grade.

“Unless the government presents a credible fiscal consolidation plan in the February 2018 budget, debt sustainability is at risk,” Moody’s analyst for South Africa Zuzana Brixiova said in a statement.

“The lack of fiscal consolidation in the budget is also a setback to already feeble business confidence and growth.”

Gigaba widened the 2017/18 budget deficit estimate to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and lowered this year’s growth forecast to 0.7 percent from 1.3 percent.

The economic gloom surrounding South Africa is compounded by allegations of corruption in state-owned companies and of influence-peddling in government that have hurt investor confidence.

The ruling African National Congress party will in December elect a successor to President Jacob Zuma as party chief, which adds to the climate of uncertainty.

GROWTH CONCERNS

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Monday it welcomed the Treasury’s transparency on the state of the economy in the medium-term budget policy statement.

“The key now is to come up with articulate policies and ultimately implement policies that will make sure that you contain the debt level but more importantly ... ameliorate the policy uncertainty,” IMF Africa Director Abebe Selassie told Reuters in Harare.

He added: “Growth agenda is as important as fiscal consolidation agenda.”

Daniel Mminele, a deputy governor of South Africa’s central bank, said GDP growth was unlikely to be maintained at levels achieved in the second quarter when the economy emerged from recession.

Africa’s most advanced economy grew by 2.5 percent in the three months to the end of June, after contracting by 0.6 percent in the first quarter and by 0.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. But the outlook remains bleak.

“We may not be in a recession, but it is quite doubtful that the 2.5 percent momentum of the second quarter can be sustained,” Mminele said in a speech posted on the bank’s website.

The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) was taking a cautious approach to further monetary policy easing, with Mminele saying risks to the inflation outlook were “too skewed to the upside”.

“The SARB remains concerned that (inflation) expectations have become too closely anchored around the upper end of the 3-6 percent target band,” Mminele said.

“Not only does this raise the risk that any shock to prices will result in a durable overshoot of the target range; it also leaves South African inflation structurally higher than in most of its trading partners.”

The central bank surprised markets in September by leaving the benchmark lending rate unchanged at 6.75 percent following a 25 basis point cut in July. The consensus was for a 25 basis points cut.

Das teilte das Unternehmen am Donnerstag nach einer Sitzung des Aufsichtsrats in Eschborn bei Frankfurt mit. Kengeter werde das Unternehmen noch bis zum 31. Dezember führen. Zur Nachfolge des 50-jährigen ehemaligen Investmentbankers, der 2015 auf dem Chefsessel der Börse Platz genommen hatte, wurde zunächst nichts mitgeteilt. Die Finanzaufsicht BaFin und die beim Wirtschaftsministerium in Wiesbaden angesiedelte hessische Börsenaufsicht erklärten nur Stunden nach Bekanntwerden des Rücktritts, dass sie die angekündigte Zuverlässigkeitsprüfung Kengeters nicht mehr vornehmen werden.

Zuletzt hatten Insider dem bisherigen Finanzchef Gregor Pottmeyer die besten Chancen eingeräumt, wenigstens für eine Übergangszeit. Aber auch andere Vorstandsmitglieder wurden genannt. Klaus Nieding von der Deutschen Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz (DSW) sagte zu Reuters, die Börse benötige nun einen nicht nur in der Branche gut vernetzten Chef, sondern einen Top-Manager, der auch intensive Beziehungen zur Landes- und Bundespolitik habe. Denn die Politik hat bei der Börse einen großen Einfluss. “Für die Deutsche Börse AG gilt es nach der britischen ”Brexit“-Entscheidung jetzt, die führende europäische Börse zu werden”, sagte Nieding.

An den Finanzmärkten wurde die Aussicht auf einen personellen Neuanfang mit Erleichterung aufgenommen. Die im Leitindex Dax notierte Börse-Aktie verteuerte sich um fast ein Prozent. Nach Handelsschluss werden auch noch die Quartalszahlen des Konzerns erwartet.

WIE GEHT ES WEITER?

Der Druck auf Kengeter war zuletzt massiv gestiegen: Die Staatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt hatte erst Anfang der Woche die Ermittlungen gegen ihn wieder aufgenommen, nachdem zuvor ein Deal mit der Justiz am Widerspruch des zuständigen Gerichts gescheitert war. Sowohl im Aufsichtsrat als auch bei großen Aktionären der Börse hatten sich zuletzt die Stimmen gemehrt, die eine Ablösung Kengeters forderten. Der durch die Affäre enstandene Imageschaden für die Börse sei zu groß.

Kengeter wird vorgeworfen, er habe Aktien der Deutschen Börse erworben, um von Kursgewinnen zu profitieren - als er bereits plante, die Londoner Börse LSE zu übernehmen. Dieses Vorhaben war später gescheitert. Kengeter beteuert bis heute seine Unschuld. Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Faber, der das umstrittene Aktienoptionsprogramm auf den Weg brachte, hatte sich lange hinter Kengeter gestellt. Allerdings war der Druck zuletzt auch auf Faber gestiegen - intern wie extern.

Der Deal mit der Staatsanwaltschaft sah die Einstellung des Verfahrens gegen eine Zahlung von 500.000 Euro durch Kengeter vor. Das Amtsgericht Frankfurt durchkreuzte die Pläne. Insider hatten daraufhin die Chanchen auf eine Verlängerung des Ende März 2018 auslaufenden Vertrages für den Manager als mehr oder weniger gleich null bezeichnet.

Doch selbst wenn der Deal geklappt hätte, wäre Kengeter noch nicht vom Haken gewesen. Denn die Finanzaufsicht BaFin und die hessische Börsenaufsicht in Wiesbaden wollten anschließend die Zuverlässigkeit Kengeters in zwei getrennten Verfahren unter die Lupe nehmen. Die beiden Aufsichtsbehörden teilten am Donnerstag mit, dass diese Untersuchungen nicht mehr erfolgen sollen, da sie ohnehin nicht bis Kengeters Abgang beendet worden wären. “Wir erwarten unabhängig davon, dass das Unternehmen weiterhin seinen Aufgaben als Träger der Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse in vollem Umfang nachkommen wird”, sagte ein Sprecher des hessischen Wirtschaftsministeriums.",Börsen-Chef Kengeter nimmt wegen Insider-Affäre seinen Hut,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-deutsche-b-rse-idDEKBN1CV28F

The initiative comes as President Donald Trump is trying to lighten rules on Wall Street and the bank regulator, Keith Noreika, acting Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), must weigh whether to vet new Wells Fargo executives.

If Noreika’s approach prevails, the OCC could go easier on Wells Fargo and any other large banks sanctioned in the future.

Since Noreika took control of the OCC in May, he has advocated easing up on sanctions imposed on Wells Fargo in the wake of the scandal over abusive sales practices, according to current and former officials.

Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement in September 2016 after admitting that its sales staff opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers’ consent. Since then the estimate has climbed to as many as 3.5 million.

As part of the deal with regulators, incoming Wells Fargo executives can face a vetting from the OCC while severance payouts must be cleared by the OCC and a sister agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

But Noreika wants officials to work faster when they review severance pay and the agency can choose to waive its check on incoming executives.

Wells Fargo declined comment on the reviews.

Hundreds of Wells Fargo employees have had their severance payouts frozen when they left as regulators tried to determine what role those employees might have had in the scandal.

Under one proposal floated by the OCC, departing employees would collect severance automatically if regulators could not finish their review within weeks, according to one current and two former officials who were not authorized to discuss an internal debate.

Under another scenario, the OCC could push for payouts to a Wells Fargo employee without waiting for the FDIC to concur. The FDIC has the final say on severance and until now the decisions have always been made jointly.

The FDIC has resisted hurrying its severance reviews, according to those familiar with the discussions.

But the current FDIC chief, Martin Gruenberg, could be replaced within weeks by a President Trump nominee.

If that happens and Noreika prevails, it could provide relief for Wells Fargo as it faces fresh scrutiny for wrongly charging customers for car insurance and mortgages.

Noreika is expected to leave the OCC in coming weeks, but the matter could be settled by Joseph Otting, the former banker who is Trump’s permanent pick for the OCC. Otting is expected to favor a similar, light touch approach to financial rules.

PAYOUTS

The “golden parachute” rule is meant to halt payouts to employees who played a role in a bank’s problems, but Noreika has said too many innocent Wells Fargo employees are caught up in the reviews.

In a June 5 letter to a former Wells Fargo employee made public by the OCC, Noreika said that he had personally called Gruenberg to expedite a payment.

In the weeks after that letter was sent, sources said, the OCC has proposed speeding up the reviews, but the FDIC pushed back against setting “artificial” deadlines, according to one official.

“The OCC has sought ways to make regulatory reviews more efficient (and) complete in weeks not months,” OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard said, while declining to discuss inter-agency deliberations.

The FDIC defended the pace of its severance audits, which in some cases have taken months to finish.

“When delays occur, it is generally because the applying institution provided incomplete or inconsistent information,” said Barbara Hagenbaugh, spokeswoman for the FDIC.

Severance payouts are simple to calculate for rank-and-file Wells Fargo employees who can get two weeks’ pay for each year of work. It gets more complex for senior executives who get a mix of salary, bonuses, stocks and other perks.

For example, James Strother, the bank’s former chief counsel who retired this summer, was among senior Wells Fargo executives that had $32 million in payouts frozen in March. But Strother has yet to repay a $310,000 interest-free loan Wells Fargo granted him in 2001, a year before such insider loans were banned, according to securities filings and the bank.

“Mr. Strother has informed us that he does plan on paying back the loan, as required and expected,” said Diana Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo.

Strother declined to comment.

According to several former officials, the FDIC has authority to scrutinize such loans under their ‘golden parachute’ review, adding another layer of complexity to the process.",U.S. regulator wants to loosen leash on Wells Fargo: sources,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-compensation/u-s-regulator-wants-to-loosen-leash-on-wells-fargo-sources-idUSKBN1CZ0D8?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran.","These are challenging times for North Africa’s Muslim governments. Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite. Algiers was Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s first stop in North Africa in June.

Given the tiny number of Shi’ites living in North Africa and the tight control over mosques in the region, widespread Shi’ite religious influence on the ground is unrealistic. Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

The multi-party Democratic Unity coalition has had a tough 2017, first failing to bring down Maduro in four months of protests that led to 125 deaths, then losing surprisingly to the Socialist Party in a gubernatorial election earlier this month.

That has left the opposition weakened and divided, and Maduro strengthened, despite growing foreign pressure on his government over alleged rights abuses and corruption, and an unprecedented economic crisis that has millions skipping food.

Three heavyweight movements in the opposition - Justice First, Popular Will and Democratic Action - announced on Monday they did not trust the government-leaning election board sufficiently to participate in the municipal polls in December.

Justice First leader Julio Borges, who also heads the opposition-led congress, said authorities cheated in the 2013 presidential election, denied Venezuelans a recall referendum last year, and rigged the Oct. 15 gubernatorial vote.

So instead of going into another “manipulated” vote, the opposition should focus on demanding reforms to the election board in anticipation of next year’s presidential poll, he said.

“The objective remains getting Nicolas Maduro out of power, and in this struggle, the world is with us,” he told reporters.

To the surprise of some, the Democratic Action party also joined the boycott. Its candidates won four governorships in October’s vote and then infuriated many opposition supporters by swearing loyalty to a pro-Maduro legislative superbody.

Opposition supporters have been split over participating in elections this year. Some say it is the only way to show they are a majority and undermine Maduro, while a growing number argue there is no point in fighting a “dictator” via a system rigged in his favor.

They are pinning their hopes on international action, including U.S. sanctions against Maduro’s government.

Maduro, whose personal popularity has plunged since his 2013 election due to food shortages and runaway inflation, said “sabotage” and “insurrection” were being planned against the mayoral votes.

“I declare myself in battle,” the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez said in a meeting with governors on Monday.

“Those who attack the election system must pay.”

Opposition leaders say the government has long been rigging elections by gross abuse of state funds in favor of socialist candidates, and dirty tricks such the last-minute moving of vote centers in opposition areas for the October ballot.

They have also presented some allegations of ballot-rigging.

However, Maduro insists Venezuela’s system is entirely trustworthy and impossible to hack. It has received international praise in the past, although it was slammed over July’s vote for the Constituent Assembly superbody.

Maduro says the street protests earlier this year were a mask for a U.S.-backed coup plot, and accuses opponents of wanting to oust him by undemocratic means.

Qatar in July signed a memorandum of understanding with the United States to increase cooperation on fighting terrorism finance and was one of six Gulf nations last week to announce sanctions on 13 individuals said to be al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt

Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.

“The weekend pause for thought did us good,” said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed.

But Monday’s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week.

One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. Der Spiegel magazine reported the FDP might head a weakened finance ministry, with key European affairs functions hived off to another ministry.

Negotiators emerged on Monday with a document spelling out areas where they had reached agreement, including commitments to universal gigabit-speed internet by 2025, and spending 3.5 percent of economic output on research and development.

After discussions that ran late into the evening, they also signed up to Merkel’s election campaign pledge of achieving full employment, without giving a specific target date.

Merkel, whose conservatives came first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 national elections must forge a so-called “Jamaica” coalition - named because the three camps’ colors match that country’s flag - that is untested at national level.

George Papadopoulos (3rd L) appears in a photograph released on Donald Trump's social media accounts with a headline stating that the scene was of his campaign's national security meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. on March 31, 2016 and published April 1, 2016. Social Media/Handout via REUTERS

George Papadopoulos, who joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016, lied in January about communicating with those individuals to arrange a meeting between then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said in the documents.

The documents said an unidentified campaign official advised Papadopoulos around May 2016 that Trump himself “is not doing these trips” but that “it should be someone low-level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.”

While not mentioned in the documents, top Trump campaign advisers, including Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Campaign Manager Paul Manafort met at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016 with Russians claiming to have derogatory information on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. It was not known whether that meeting resulted from Papadopoulos’ efforts.

The special counsel said Papadopoulos - a Chicago-based international energy lawyer - lied to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about when he learned from an unnamed foreign professor that Russia claimed to have “dirt” in the form of “thousands of emails” on Clinton.

Prosecutors said Papadopoulos told agents he had been in contact with the professor before he joined Trump’s campaign. In fact, they said, Papadopoulos met with the professor after joining the campaign.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Monday played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she told a news briefing. “Any actions that he took would have been on his own.”

Papadopoulos’ lawyers said in a statement it was “in the best interest of our client .... that we refrain from commenting on George’s case.”

The documents were released just after indictments charging Manafort and business associate Rick Gates with multiple offenses, including money laundering, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents.

None of the charges against Manafort and Gates, however, directly relate to Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and what U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Russian bid to boost Trump’s candidacy.

The prosecutors said Papadopoulos had been emailing with a “Campaign Supervisor,” “Senior Policy Adviser” and a “High-Ranking Campaign Official.”

An official familiar with congressional investigations into alleged contacts between the campaign and Russia said the Senate Intelligence Committee already had copies of an extensive file of Trump campaign emails that included emails between Papadopoulos and the campaign.

One email shows Manafort had been discussing Papadopoulos’ efforts to arrange a Trump visit to Russia with at least one other campaign official.

PLEA DEAL

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on Oct. 5, according to a court statement by Mueller’s office. As part of a plea deal, Papadopoulos agreed to plead guilty to making a “materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement” to FBI agents.

“Through his false statements and omissions, defendant Papadopoulos impeded the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the Campaign and the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,” a court document said.

The FBI arrested Papadopoulos on July 27 after he arrived at Dulles International Airport near Washington.

In an Oct. 5 letter to the Chicago man’s lawyer, Mueller and his team noted that Papadopoulos faced up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $9,500. But they agreed “to bring to the court’s attention at sentencing the defendant’s efforts to cooperate with the government” on condition that he continued providing information on to prosecutors, the document said.

Court documents said Papadopoulos lied to the FBI shortly after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, when the law enforcement agency had an open investigation into the alleged Russian government efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign.

In addition to lying about the timing of his contacts with the professor, prosecutors said Papadopoulos mischaracterized his contacts with that individual as “inconsequential.”

“In truth and in fact, however, defendant Papadopoulos understood the professor to have substantial connections to high-level Russian government officials and that the professor spoke with some of those officials in Moscow” before telling Papadopoulos about the “dirt” on Clinton, said the prosecutors.

The prosecutors said Papadopoulos also lied to the FBI in saying that a meeting the professor arranged for him in London with an unidentified Russian woman with ties to senior Russian officials occurred before the Chicago man joined the campaign.

The meeting took place on or about March 24, 2016, and the Russian woman was introduced to Papadopoulos as a relative of Putin, although it turned out that she was not related to the Russian leader, according to the documents.

Papadopoulos then worked with the professor and the Russian woman to set up the Putin meeting, and kept other Trump foreign policy advisers appraised of his contacts, they said.

In one email, the documents said, the Russian woman told Papadopoulos that ”The Russian Federation would love to welcome him (Trump) once his candidature would be officially announced.”

The prosecutors said that on or about March 31 Papadopoulos attended a “national security meeting” in Washington with then-candidate Trump and other campaign foreign policy advisers. When he introduced himself to the group, the prosecutors said, “he stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then candidate Trump and President Putin.”

In mid-April, the professor introduced Papadopoulos via an email to an individual in Moscow who the documents dubbed the Russian MFA Connection - MFA being the initials for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The pair had multiple conversations over the proceeding weeks about setting the “groundwork” for a Trump-Putin meeting.",Former Trump adviser Papadopoulos pleads guilty to lying to FBI,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-papadopolous/former-trump-adviser-papadopolous-pleads-guilty-to-false-statements-idUSKBN1CZ1RJ

Barca rode their luck to beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 away on Saturday to maintain a four-point gap at the top of the table, thanks to an outstanding display from goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and a Raul Garcia shot that bounced off the bar.

Barca won 3-0 at Girona last month and only dropped points in a 1-1 draw at Atletico Madrid. They also have a perfect record in the Champions League and could reach the last 16 if they win at Valverde’s old club Olympiakos Piraeus on Tuesday.

“La Liga is really difficult,” Valverde said ahead of the Group D game in Athens.

”We aren’t the only team that has to suffer to win. Madrid lost at Girona and Atletico drew at home (to Villarreal). The points are worth a lot and you have to work very hard to win.

“We all expect to slip up at some point and the distances between teams can increase or decrease, but last weekend shows that we have to really appreciate these victories.”

Barca beat Olympiakos 3-1 two weeks ago despite playing the second half with 10 men but Valverde expects a tougher time at the noisy Karaiskakis Stadium, where he is revered for leading the Greek giants to three league titles and two domestic Cups.

“It’s very exciting to come back to this stadium again. It means so much to me and I‘m looking forward to the game for every reason,” added Valverde, who coached Olympiakos between 2008 and 2012 in two separate spells.

“We are playing for the right to qualify from the group, three points are at stake and we get to experience a marvellous atmosphere.”

Barca’s rampant start to the season contrasts to Olympiakos’s dismal run of results. They have lost all three games in the Champions League and on Saturday were beaten 1-0 by fierce city rivals Panathinaikos.

“In Barcelona they played defensively and tried to catch us out but at their place they’ll have a huge lift from their fans and they’ll want to beat us,” Valverde said.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

On the positive side, the survey showed that 58 percent of respondents had a positive view of Americans in general. And in many regions of the world, a majority or plurality of respondents said they expected relations with the United States to stay roughly the same in spite of Trump.","Image of the United States has plunged under Trump, survey shows",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-image-survey/image-of-the-united-states-has-plunged-under-trump-survey-shows-idUSKBN19I00F

The announcement comes after the unravelling of its previous debt repayment plan, which had hinged on merging its mobile operations with rival Aircel and selling a 51 percent stake in its tower arm to Canada’s Brookfield.

However, the Aircel merger was called off on Oct. 1 over what RCom called regulatory delays and legal uncertainties, forcing it to renegotiate a plan to sell its tower unit to Brookfield for 110 billion rupees as the tower assets had to be revalued.

RCom’s shares have tumbled 18 percent to a series of record lows since the Aircel merger was called off, adding urgency for the company to come up with a new debt repayment plan.

RCom executives on Monday said talks with Brookfield were still going on, with the Canadian company open to buying the entire tower mobile business, though noting there were other suitors as well.

RCom’s Executive Director Punit Garg said the lenders had agreed to the new debt repayment plan, which will spare creditors any write-offs. The deals will be completed by the end of March, he added.

“The lenders were very, very comfortable looking at the conservative management estimate of monetising these assets worth (170 billion rupees),” Garg told reporters.

“What we have presented is a zero write-off plan (to the lenders). They were so happy and thrilled.”

There was no immediate comment from the lenders, led by State Bank of India.

Monday’s plan also involves lenders swapping about 70 billion rupees worth of debt for a 51 percent stake in the company. RCom will retain about 60 billion rupees in debt after the repayment plans go through.

RCom, with 443 billion rupees ($6.8 billion) of net debt as of March is the most leveraged among listed Indian telecom companies.

The debt load has spooked investors, sending RCom’s shares tumbling this year amid worries about whether it could pay back creditors at a time when profits across the telecom sector are slumping due to stiff competition sparked by the entry of start-up Jio, led by Anil Ambani’s older brother Mukesh Ambani.

Jio, owned by Reliance Industries, is also among potential suitors for some of RCom’s assets, Garg said, without elaborating.

RCom is in the midst of scaling down its wireless business in India and plans to focus on catering to corporate customers.

Five of Miller’s sixes came in one over off Bangladesh seamer Mohammad Saifuddin as he showed remarkable timing in smashing the ball to all parts of the ground.

“It’s a really special feeling,” Miller told SuperSport. “I tried to watch the ball and back myself. I was scratchy to be honest in the beginning and towards the back end it turned out to be sweet.”

India, backed by the United States, has been trying to get Maulana Masood Azhar on a U.N. list of groups with ties to Al Qaeda, blaming his group for a series of attacks in India, including one on its parliament in 2002 and another last year on an airbase.

But China, a member of the U.N. Security Council, has repeatedly put a technical hold on the Indian request, the latest of which is due to end this week.

Such decisions must be based on cast-iron evidence and fully backed by members of the U.N. panel charged with implementing resolutions relating to sanctions on militant groups and individuals, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

“China proposed a technical hold, the aim of which was to give more time for the committee members to discuss it and for relevant parties to have further consultations,” Hua told a daily news briefing.

“But regrettably, the committee has yet to reach consensus.”

The wrangling over Masood Azhar, a longtime Indian foe, has become a thorny issue in ties between China and India, which fears Beijing is disregarding its concerns over terrorism.

It has also fuelled worries that China will stick to its “all-weather” friend, India’s arch-foe Pakistan, no matter the weight of evidence against Islamabad.

Pakistan denies giving material support to militants fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir besides carrying out attacks elsewhere.

It said it interrogated Azhar and his associates in the Jaish-e-Mohammad group after the January 2016 attack on the Pathankot air base but found no evidence linking him to it.

Hua said there were clear rules for listing a person or group as a terrorist, and that China has always believed the relevant U.N. committee should operate on the principles of objectivity, fairness and professionalism on this matter.

Shares of the world’s second largest confectionary company rose 4.9 percent to $41.20 in after-market trading on Monday.

Mondelez’s organic revenue, a measure that excludes currency fluctuations, grew 3.2 percent in Europe and 5.4 percent in Latin America in the quarter that marks the end of Irene Rosenfeld’s tenure as its chief executive officer.

The company said its performance in Europe was helped by strong chocolate sales in Germany and the U.K.

However, sales in North America, its second largest market, remains a concern for the packaged goods company.

Net revenue from North America rose 1.3 percent but lagged behind its smaller rival Hershey (HSY.N), which posted a 1.6 percent rise in sales in the region in October.

North America is the only region performing below expectations but the company is confident in improving it in the future, Rosenfeld said in the earnings call.

The company said McCain Foods CEO Dirk Van de Put will take over on Nov. 20 from Rosenfeld.

Rosenfeld’s departure comes after years of consistent decline in sales for Mondelez, which was formed from a spin-off of Kraft’s North America grocery business in 2012 - a move that she engineered.

The snack giant said on Monday it is recovering from last quarter’s cyber attack that hurt shipment volumes and has led to $100 million loss in revenue for the full year.

Total organic net revenue rose 2.8 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30 and the recovery in shipment volumes contributed 0.6 percent to it.

Organic net revenue from its key brands, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka chocolate and Oreo cookies, rose 3.8 percent in the quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent rise, a year earlier.

The company, which is planning to cut about $3 billion in cost by 2018 end, slashed its costs by 14.3 percent to $1.33 billion in the reporting quarter.

Net income attributable to Mondelez rose 81 percent to $992 million, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter, helped by one-time gains and taxes.[GNXOGLJSa]

Excluding items, it earned 57 cents a share and revenue rose 2.1 percent to $6.53 billion.

Analysts on average had expected the company to report a profit of 54 cents per share on revenue of $6.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.","Oreo maker Mondelez's results beat on gains from Europe, Latin America",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mondelez-results/oreo-maker-mondelezs-results-beat-on-gains-from-europe-latin-america-idUSKBN1CZ2HR

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

The Republican president, who is considering Powell, current Fed Chair Janet Yellen and three others for the top central bank job, will announce his decision on Thursday, a White House official said separately.

By picking Powell, a soft-spoken centrist and Fed governor since 2012, Trump would get the combination of a leadership change and the continuity offered by somebody who has been a part of the Yellen-run Fed that has kept the economy and markets steady in recent years.

Powell, 64, has supported Yellen’s general direction in setting monetary policy, and in recent years has shared her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates.

“Powell has not offended people, and that’s a huge advantage in Washington. He’s the kind of guy who can get through Senate confirmation, and this administration has so many other problems to deal with,” said John Silva, chief economist at Wells Fargo.

Flags fly over the Federal Reserve Headquarters on a windy day in Washington, U.S., May 26, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

The main challenger to Powell is Stanford University economist John Taylor, a favorite of conservative Republicans who believe monetary policy has been too loose under Yellen and want the central bank to rely more on rules when setting rates.

Taylor has spent the last two decades refining and pushing for wider use of a rule that sets out where rates should be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. His rule implies they should be higher than they are now.

Critics say that a Taylor-run Fed would run the risk of tightening monetary policy too fast and choking off the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.

The race for the Fed job has shifted between Yellen, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama to a one-year term in 2014, Powell and Taylor in recent weeks. Financial markets had pushed Treasury yields higher on talk Taylor would get the job.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR were yielding 2.37 percent in mid-afternoon trading on Monday, down from 2.43 percent on Friday.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray speaks in Washington, October 17, 2014. REUTERS/Larry Downing

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent regulator headed by Democrat Richard Cordray, finalized a rule in July barring banks, credit-card issuers and other financial companies from requiring customers to give up their rights to join group lawsuits, known as class actions, and only take potential disputes to closed-door arbitration.

Congress recently voted to kill the rule in a special resolution that Trump, a Republican, is expected to sign into law soon.

“You alone now have the power to safeguard people’s ability to take action together and go to court when they are wronged,” Cordray, expected to resign soon to run for Ohio governor, wrote to Trump.

White House officials were not immediately available to comment on the letter.

In class actions, individuals with the same complaint band together to lower lawsuit costs.

Trump has not vetoed any legislation since taking office in January. But he has frequently criticized both Cordray, appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, and the CFPB, established after the financial crisis to protect individuals against predatory lending.

Cordray wrote he had never met or spoken to Trump, but that “many have told me.... your mind is made up” about the resolution.

Shortly after the Senate passed the resolution last Tuesday, the White House released a statement saying the CFPB rule would give consumers fewer options to resolve disputes quickly and efficiently and would primarily enrich trial lawyers. The administration has also said the CFPB used faulty research to write the rule.

The CFPB says its five-year study into mandatory arbitration was thorough and its rule based on sound data. Rule supporters say arbitration is stacked in favor of companies, which hire the mediators, and that the right to trial is enshrined in the Constitution. On Friday, military veterans also asked for a veto.

Regulators almost never make personal pleas for vetoes, let alone release their requests publicly.

Cordray has a strained relationship with Republicans, who say he has too much power because he both writes and enforces rules and can only be fired “for cause,” a strict standard nearly impossible to meet.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday.

It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.

Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges against them in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday.

The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies.

Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office.

Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine.

The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.

A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.

“We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing.

Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign.

Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said the charges against Manafort could put pressure on him to cooperate with the Russia investigation.

”If I were the defense lawyer, I’d be looking into cooperating,” he said.

In a development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.

Mueller’s office said Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain which stated that he has since “met with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document.

White House spokeswoman Sanders played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer.

“He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election, by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Clinton.

Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

Trump on Monday reiterated his frustration with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” Moscow also denies the allegations.

“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton.

Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.

Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities, the indictment said.

They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said.

The indictment said Manafort owned properties in Manhattan; Brooklyn; the Hamptons; Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Prosecutors said Manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. They also said he had been making payments on four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.

Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman.

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for the Trump administration to avoid interfering with Mueller’s probe.

“The rule of law is paramount in America and the investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded. The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” Schumer said.","Two ex-Trump aides charged in Russia probe, third pleads guilty",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia/two-ex-trump-aides-charged-in-russia-probe-third-pleads-guilty-idINKBN1CZ0S5

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent regulator headed by Democrat Richard Cordray, finalized a rule in July barring banks, credit-card issuers and other financial companies from requiring customers to give up their rights to join group lawsuits, known as class actions, and only take potential disputes to closed-door arbitration.

Congress recently voted to kill the rule in a special resolution that Trump, a Republican, is expected to sign into law soon.

“You alone now have the power to safeguard people’s ability to take action together and go to court when they are wronged,” Cordray, expected to resign soon to run for Ohio governor, wrote to Trump.

White House officials were not immediately available to comment on the letter.

In class actions, individuals with the same complaint band together to lower lawsuit costs.

Trump has not vetoed any legislation since taking office in January. But he has frequently criticized both Cordray, appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, and the CFPB, established after the financial crisis to protect individuals against predatory lending.

Cordray wrote he had never met or spoken to Trump, but that “many have told me.... your mind is made up” about the resolution.

Shortly after the Senate passed the resolution last Tuesday, the White House released a statement saying the CFPB rule would give consumers fewer options to resolve disputes quickly and efficiently and would primarily enrich trial lawyers. The administration has also said the CFPB used faulty research to write the rule.

The CFPB says its five-year study into mandatory arbitration was thorough and its rule based on sound data. Rule supporters say arbitration is stacked in favor of companies, which hire the mediators, and that the right to trial is enshrined in the Constitution. On Friday, military veterans also asked for a veto.

Regulators almost never make personal pleas for vetoes, let alone release their requests publicly.

Cordray has a strained relationship with Republicans, who say he has too much power because he both writes and enforces rules and can only be fired “for cause,” a strict standard nearly impossible to meet.

The pilot program aims to speed up the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles into the national airspace system and test drone detection and tracking while waiving some limits on their use.

Under a memorandum signed by Trump on Wednesday, states and local governments would be able to seek Federal Aviation Administration approval for testing and expanded use. The White House stopped short of proposing new regulations that would allow broader nationwide use of drones or any timetable for new authority.

White House adviser Michael Kratsios told reporters the “program will open the skies for delivery of life-saving medicines and commercial packages, inspections of critical infrastructure, support for emergency management operations.”

Kratsios said the program would allow companies and governments to operate drones in ways that are currently restricted by the FAA “including beyond-visual-line-of-sight flights, nighttime operations, and flights over people.”

Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies hoping to make package delivery by drones a reality.

The memo said the Transportation Department could allow drone flights at up to 400 feet with the goal of approving at least five pilot projects. The program would expire in three years.

In 2016, the Obama administration opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use, but left in place significant restrictions.

The FAA estimates by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000.

In June, Trump told drone executives the administration wants “to create new companies and lots of jobs... We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.”

In attendance were chief executives of drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and Precision Hawk Inc.

Drone manufacturers have argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does pre-approve self-driving vehicle technologies.

But security concerns remain.

In September, a civilian drone struck and damaged a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Staten Island, New York.

This month, a drone hit an airplane landing at a Quebec City airport, the first time an unmanned flying object collided with commercial aircraft in Canada.

The FAA has banned drone flights over 133 U.S. military facilities and over 10 U.S. landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty in New York and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, at the request of national security and law enforcement agencies.

The memo said that the Transportation Department would coordinate with the Defense Department, Homeland Security and Justice Department to consider public safety and national security risks in approving pilot projects.

The Commercial Drone Alliance said it was “optimistic that the program will become a model for overcoming some of the hurdles keeping the full potential of commercial drones from being realized.”

Senator John Thune, a Republican, said the new policy “provides sensible direction that promotes drone safety, innovation, and local input.”",Trump administration program to test expanded drone use,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-drones/trump-administration-program-to-test-expanded-drone-use-idUSKBN1CU2EA

House and Senate Republicans are on a fast-track to pass separate tax bills before the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, iron out differences in December, send a final version to Trump’s desk before January and ultimately hand the president his first major legislative victory. Analysts say there is a good chance the tax overhaul will be delayed until next year.

The NAHB, which boasts 130,000 member firms employing 9 million workers, says the bill would harm U.S. home prices by marginalizing the value of mortgage interest deductions as an incentive for buying homes. The trade group wants legislation to offer a tax credit equaling 12 percent of mortgage interest and property tax payments but says it was rebuffed by House Republican leaders.

“We’re opposed to the tax bill without the tax credit in there, and we’ll be working very aggressively to see it defeated,” NAHB chief executive Jerry Howard told Reuters.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the top House Republican on tax policy, suggested in a statement that the NAHB credit could still be included, saying: “I hope members of Congress will examine it closely to determine if they want it included.”

Republicans warned that the Trump tax plan is entering a new and difficult phase as lobbyists ramp up pressure on lawmakers to spare their pet tax breaks.

“When groups start rallying against things and they succeed, everything starts unraveling,” Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican fiscal hawk, told CBS’ Face the Nation.

ANXIETY IN HIGH-TAX STATES

One of the biggest challenges involves a proposal to eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), which analysts say would hit upper middle-class families in high income tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. The states are home to enough House Republicans to stymie legislation.

Brady gave ground over the weekend, saying he would allow a deduction for some local taxes to remain.

“We are restoring an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens,” Brady said in another statement.

But the gesture appeared to do little to turn the tide of opposition to SALT’s elimination.

“I‘m not going to sign onto anything until the full package is fully analyzed by economists,” Representative Peter King of New York told the Fox News program Sunday Morning Futures.

“The fact that we’re getting it at the eleventh hour raises real issues with me,” he added.

A lobby coalition representing state and local governments, realtors and public unions rejected Brady’s statement outright, saying the move would “unfairly penalize taxpayers in states that rely significantly on income taxes.”

House Republicans have also faced opposition from Trump and others after proposing to sharply curtail tax-free contributions to 401(k) programs and move retirement savings to a style of account that allows tax-free withdrawals, rather than the tax-exempt contributions that are popular with 401(k) investors.

House Republicans now say they could permit higher 401(k) contribution limits but continue to talk about tax-free withdrawals. “We will expand the amount that you can invest. But we’ll also give you an option to actually not be taxed later in life,” House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News.

The current cap on annual 401(k) tax-free contributions is $18,000.

Corker said congressional tax committees seem to be falling short of their goal to eliminate $4 trillion in tax breaks to prevent the Trump plan from adding to the federal deficit.

“They’re having great difficulty just getting to $3.6 trillion,” said the Tennessee Republican, who has vowed to vote against tax reform if it increases a federal debt load that stands at more than $20 trillion.

Ohio’s Republican governor, John Kasich, told Fox News Sunday that spending on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security should also be reviewed as part of the effort to pay for tax cuts.

“It may be separate from the tax bill, but it needs to happen,” Kasich said.",Trump tax overhaul under intensifying fire as Congress readies bill,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/trump-tax-overhaul-under-intensifying-fire-as-congress-readies-bill-idUSKBN1CY0ST
