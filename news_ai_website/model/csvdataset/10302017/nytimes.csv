5 Bargain Destinations for Fall Travel

Fall isn’t just about pretty leaves for travelers. Those willing to venture overseas could end up with some major savings, according to Hipmunk, the website and app that studies itineraries and other data to reveal affordable travel deals.

Hipmunk recently looked at a year’s worth of flight bookings to determine some of the best off-season bargain destinations for the fall season. It analyzed roundtrip flights departing from the United States to international cities between Oct 1. of last year through Sept. 30 of this year. The savings percentage is based on maximum monthly pricing for that destination.

Here are selections from our coverage of some of those recommendations, including the percentage of savings for that destination.

Brussels, Belgium

Average November Fare: $824 (-63 percent)

“There is literally nothing to do here,” the British musician Noel Gallagher once said of Brussels, that hotbed of policy directives. Clearly he didn’t have a chance to admire the graffiti, avant-garde installations or conceptual creations in the city’s new art spaces. Or shop for vintage items in the many retro and antique boutiques. Or taste the innovative dishes in the city’s neo-Belgian and Belgian-fusion restaurants.

Cape Town, South Africa

Average November Fare: $1,875 (-55 percent)

Heralded as one of the world’s most beautiful cities — few destinations can mimic the scale of its mountain-ocean convergence — Cape Town doesn’t need to be as accommodating as it is; it could, in theory, sit pretty on the merits of its natural bounties alone. And yet it remains a singularly inviting place.

Berlin

Average November Fare: $991 (-42 percent)

There are few cities in the world that transform themselves as profoundly from season to season as Berlin. It remains a place for the strange and libertine, where the radical left still nips at the heels of neoliberalism, where snapping photos in public is often more taboo than smoking a joint, and where people seldom ask what it is you “do.”

As impressive as Hong Kong’s skyline is, the city never seems to stop building. With all this attention on infrastructure, though, Hong Kong hasn’t sacrificed its soul. It remains one of Asia’s most passionately creative cities, a playground for artists and designers, chefs and entrepreneurs.

Tokyo

Average November Fare: $1,050 (-21 percent)

Contemplating the physical sprawl of Tokyo is dizzying. The Japanese megalopolis has no discernible center, and clusters of skyscrapers miles apart defy the idea of a downtown core. But when time is limited, don’t be distracted by the hypnotic, multistory video screens. Instead, focus on a diverse cross-section of neighborhoods, from peaceful Nakameguro to eclectic Koenji, for a taste of this capital that will leave you hungry for more.

In a major league season that included more home runs than ever before, the Astros led all teams in slugging percentage — while also having the fewest strikeouts. In that way, Game 5 was their masterpiece. The Astros got homers from Yuli Gurriel, Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa and Brian McCann, and fanned just six times in 47 trips to the plate.

The final batted ball was a two-out single to left by Alex Bregman off the Dodgers’ Kenley Jansen. Derek Fisher, a rookie pinch-runner, had been inserted just before that pitch for the first time in the series. He dashed home from second, slid his orange spikes across the plate, ahead of the throw, and popped up to embrace McCann, the veteran who had told him he would do something special.

“You never know when your time’s going to be, but you’re going to have a time,” Fisher said McCann had promised him. “And it’s going to be an important time.”

For the winning run to score on such a play — a first-pitch line drive, a two-base sprint and a smooth final slide — was oddly reassuring. Most of what came before was another home run derby, the second of the series. In Game 2 at Dodger Stadium last week, the teams combined for a record eight homers in a comeback victory for the Astros, by 7-6, in 11 innings.

“I didn’t think that would ever be topped,” said Bregman, who debuted in the majors last year. “I thought that would be the best game I ever played in my career. Who knows where this one ranks? Right up there with that game.”

The teams have combined for 22 homers in five games, breaking the World Series record of 21 set in seven games in 2002, the last year before baseball began testing for steroids. One theory for the new power surge is that hitters have learned to tailor their swings to launch more fly balls, reasoning that fly balls produce more runs than grounders.

Many pitchers, though, suspect the balls are juiced because baseball wants more offense, as the Astros’ Dallas Keuchel asserted after the Game 2 slugfest. Before Sunday’s game, another Astros pitcher, Justin Verlander, told a roomful of reporters that the balls for this World Series were slicker, making them harder to grip and leading to erratic location.

Around 8 p.m., Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives broke off from the rest of their team and stopped an Infinity coupe in Calvert Vaux Park. The 18-year-old woman was driving, he said; two of her friends, both men, were also in the car.

As the detectives — both in plainclothes — approached the car, one of them shined his flashlight through the window and saw the young woman adjusting her bra. When Detective Hall asked if she was hiding something, she told him she was simply adjusting her nipple piercing, Mr. DeGaetano said. The detectives asked her to prove it, and the young woman lifted up her shirt, showing them her breasts.

A search of the car revealed a small amount of marijuana in a cup holder. The woman also had some marijuana and a few pills of Klonopin, an anti-anxiety drug, in her handbag, Mr. DeGaetano said. At that point, he added, the detectives took the woman from the car, placed her in handcuffs and put her into the second row of their Dodge police van. Driving off, they told her that she would be released within a few hours at the 60th Precinct station house. According to Mr. DeGaetano, Detective Martins used his cellphone to call the woman’s friends and explicitly instructed them not to follow the van, using a blocking function to disguise the number he was calling from.

It was then that Detective Martins sat down next to the woman and said that he and his partner were “freaks,” asking her what she wanted to do to avoid being arrested, Mr. DeGaetano said. After tightening the handcuffs, Detective Martins pulled out his penis and forced the woman to perform oral sex on him, Mr. DeGaetano said. Then he turned her around, pulled her pants down and raped her, Mr. DeGaetano added, as Detective Hall watched through the rearview mirror and the young woman cried and pleaded with Detective Martins to stop.

By that point, Mr. DeGaetano said, the van was in Bay Ridge, at least four miles from where the antidrug team had been working. Mr. DeGaetano said that Detective Hall switched places with his partner and also forced the woman to perform oral sex on him then raped her.

After the attack, Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives returned to Coney Island and dropped the woman off about five blocks from their station house. Before she left, they made her take one of her Klonopin pills and told her to “keep her mouth shut,” Mr. DeGaetano said.

Within days, the city medical examiner’s office had analyzed a rape test performed on the woman and determined that it contained samples of both detectives’ sperm, Mr. DeGaetano said. “These are extremely serious charges,” he added, saying that each could face up to 25 years in prison.

Detective Martins, who joined the Police Department in July 2006, had his bail set at $250,000, and Detective Hall, who joined in July 2010, had his bail set at $150,000. Both were suspended and demoted on Friday, after the grand jury handed up the indictment.

Even with physical evidence like DNA, rape prosecutions are often difficult, and a court document filed on Monday hinted at some of the vulnerabilities defense lawyers may seek to exploit.

One day after the encounter, which took place after dark and which the detectives had allegedly threatened the woman not to talk about, investigators from the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau interviewed her and found she that while she could identify Detective Hall from a photo array, she was unable to identify Detective Martins, according to the court document. The document also showed that her two friends were also unable to identify Detective Martins and that one of them misidentified Detective Hall.

Calling the indictment “schizophrenic,” John Arlia, a lawyer for Detective Hall, noted at the arraignment that the charges included accusations of both “forcible” rape and of using sex to bribe a police officer — a “self-contradictory” position, suggesting that the prosecutors had two theories of the case and were not entirely confident about the young woman’s account.

Mark A. Bederow, Detective Martin’s lawyer, said his client had been subjected for weeks to a “circus” of allegations made in the media by the young woman’s lawyer, Michael David. Mr. Bederow called the woman’s account “uncorroborated.” He told Justice Danny K. Chun, who is handling the case, that while prosecutors had furnished DNA evidence, they had not provided surveillance footage connected to the attack, which allegedly took place on a Friday night in the parking lot of a Chipotle restaurant, nor of the detectives releasing the woman near the station house.

Mr. Bederow added that he had “substantial information” that would undermine her story, suggesting that she had a “financial” motive to lie about the attack.

At a news conference after the arraignment, Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, asked anyone who may have had similar encounters with the detectives to come forward. He also condemned the detectives’ lawyers for attacking the victim.

“It is shocking and unfortunate that they would blame a teenager for the acts of their clients,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “To think that these are grown men in a position of power over an 18-year-old, and for them to blame her, is ridiculous and demeaning. To my mind it speaks to desperation.”",Two New York Detectives Are Charged With Raping Teenager in Custody,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/nypd-detectives-rape-kidnapping-charges.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

NAIROBI, Kenya — President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared on Monday the winner of Kenya’s presidential election — for the second time this year.

Mr. Kenyatta received nearly 7.5 million votes in the repeated vote, held last week, the national elections commission announced.

Mr. Kenyatta also won the first election, in August, by 1.4 million votes. But the opposition leader, Raila Odinga, challenged the results, and the Supreme Court nullified the election in September, citing irregularities.

Backers of Mr. Kenyatta interpreted both of his wins as broad national support for the president, but opposition supporters said they had twice been disenfranchised by a process that lacked credibility.

Mr. Odinga withdrew from the second election two weeks before the vote, arguing that the electoral commission could not oversee a free and fair process, and he called on his supporters to boycott. His name nevertheless appeared on the ballot, and he collected just over 73,000 votes, compared with nearly seven million in August.

Elections officials also cast doubt on the credibility of the process in the days before the vote. One commissioner fled the country and resigned, citing death threats and questioning the impartiality of the commission. The top elections official, Wafula Chebukati, warned a week before the polls opened that political interference in the commission’s work was likely to undermine the credibility and neutrality of the vote.

Mr. Chebukati backtracked on that criticism while announcing the results on Monday, declaring the process “free and fair.”

At least 14 people have been killed in election-related violence since the Oct. 26 vote, according to international officials, and more have been injured. The rights group Amnesty International said on Monday that it had documented at least four deaths and more than a dozen injuries since the election that it said were committed by the police, most of them in western Kenya.

Government figures put the death toll at 10.

Rights groups documented nearly 70 deaths that they said occurred at the hands of the police in the days after the August vote.

In his victory speech, Mr. Kenyatta boasted of his August victory and recast the Supreme Court’s nullification as an endorsement of his win.

“The numbers were never questioned,” Mr. Kenyatta said. “What the court questioned was the process of declaring my victory.”

On Saturday, violence broke out in the Kawangware neighborhood of Nairobi, where several people were wounded and a supermarket was burned down. Residents blamed people from Mr. Kenyatta’s ethnic group, the Kikuyu, from which he draws strong support.

One Western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of protocol, expressed concern that the violence had taken on a more ethnic overtone in the days after the election.

Martin Kimani, the director of the Kenyan national counterterrorism center, said that opposition supporters had provoked the violence. On Sunday, he accused Mr. Odinga of “dog-whistle politics” aimed at inciting ethnic violence and obstructing the vote.

“This is active sabotage of an election,” he said. “The dog whistle comes from the top, and the middle and lower levels act on it.”

Four counties in western Kenya, an opposition stronghold representing 1.6 million votes, were unable to participate in the second election. In some places on Election Day, opposition demonstrators erected roadblocks and intercepted ballot papers. In others, polling stations were blockaded, and protesters clashed with the police. Electoral officials at first delayed balloting in those counties and eventually canceled it completely, saying the outcome in those areas would not affect the overall result.

Mr. Odinga told his supporters last week that he would transform his party into a “resistance movement.” In speeches in Kawangware on Sunday, he pinned the violence there on his opponents.

“The killing here was very beastly,” he told a crowd gathered at a church. “The killing was well planned and executed,” he said, and was intended as “a direct warning to others.”

Mr. Odinga condemned the violence, which he described as perpetrated by Kenyatta supporters, but stopped short of urging his own supporters not to react with violence.

Kenyans, foreign diplomats and even some of Mr. Kenyatta’s own supporters have called on the president to engage with opposition leaders after his win, but in his victory speech the president distanced himself from dialogue.

“Those who want to ask me, ‘Are you going to engage in dialogue with so and so and so and so?’, let them first and foremost exhaust the constitutionally laid out processes,” Mr. Kenyatta said. “I am not going to jump the gun.”

Congressional investigations of possible coordination between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia are reportedly floundering, as Republicans push their own investigative committees to wrap things up, or to investigate bogus charges of collusion between Moscow and the Clinton campaign to obtain a dossier of damaging information against Mr. Trump. At times Republican lawmakers echo Mr. Trump’s charges that the investigations are a “witch hunt.”

With the release of the indictments and plea deal, Republicans in Congress need to abandon this absurd denial of reality and start asking serious questions about the validity of the 2016 election and of the Trump administration:

Why was the Trump campaign talking with people tied to Moscow, especially ones who offered to provide it with Clinton campaign emails? If what Mr. Papadopoulos was doing was legitimate, why did he lie to the F.B.I. about it?

Why are members of the administration so accommodating to Moscow?

What other connections did the campaign have to Russia?

The efforts by Mr. Trump and his Republican enablers to short-circuit congressional investigations into this, as well as to cast doubt on the special counsel’s findings, make Mr. Mueller’s work all the more important. So far, Mr. Trump hasn’t deterred Mr. Mueller and his team from conducting a careful, detailed probe of what Russia did to subvert our democratic process in 2016 and of what Mr. Trump’s associates might have done to help.

“We work hard to educate people about our services, highlight tools to help them protect their accounts and promote digital literacy,” said Debbie Frost, a Facebook spokeswoman. “To be more effective in these efforts, we are working with civil society, safety partners, and governments — an approach we have found to be particularly important and effective in countries where people are rapidly coming online and experiencing the internet for the first time through a mobile phone.”

In India, where internet use has also surged in recent years, WhatsApp, the popular Facebook-owned messaging app, has been inundated with rumors, hoaxes and false stories. In May, the Jharkhand region in Eastern India was destabilized by a viral WhatsApp message that falsely claimed that gangs in the area were abducting children. The message incited widespread panic and led to a rash of retaliatory lynchings, in which at least seven people were beaten to death. A local filmmaker, Vinay Purty, told the Hindustan Times that many of the local villagers simply believed the abduction myth was real, since it came from WhatsApp.

“Everything shared on the phone is regarded as true,” Mr. Purty said.

In a statement, WhatsApp said, “WhatsApp has made communications cheaper, easier and more reliable for millions of Indians — with all the benefits that brings. Though we understand that some people, sadly, have used WhatsApp to intimidate others and spread misinformation. It’s why we encourage people to report problematic messages to WhatsApp so that we can take action.”

Facebook is not directly responsible for violent conflict, of course, and viral misinformation is hardly unique to its services. Before social media, there were email hoaxes and urban legends passed from person to person. But the speed of Facebook’s growth in the developing world has made it an especially potent force among first-time internet users, who may not be appropriately skeptical of what they see online.

The company has made many attempts to educate users about the dangers of misinformation. In India and Malaysia, it has taken out newspaper ads with tips for spotting false news. In Myanmar, it has partnered with local organizations to distribute printed copies of its community standards, as well as created educational materials to teach citizens about proper online behavior.

But these efforts, as well-intentioned as they may be, have not stopped the violence, and Facebook does not appear to have made them a top priority. The company has no office in Myanmar, and neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Ms. Sandberg has made any public statements about the Rohingya crisis.

Correcting misinformation is a thorny philosophical problem for Facebook, which imagines itself as a neutral platform that avoids making editorial decisions. Facebook’s community standards prohibit hate speech and threats, but many harmful viral posts — such as a WhatsApp thread in Southern India that spread false rumors about a government immunization campaign — are neither hateful nor directly threatening, and they wouldn’t be prohibited under Facebook’s community standards as long as they came from authentic accounts. Fighting misinformation is especially difficult on WhatsApp, an app for private messaging, since there is no public information trail to fact-check.

Facebook has argued that the benefits of providing internet access to international users will ultimately outweigh the costs. Adam Mosseri, a Facebook vice president who oversees the News Feed, told a journalism gathering this month, “In the end, I don’t think we as a human race will regret the internet.” Mr. Zuckerberg echoed that sentiment in a 2013 manifesto titled “Is Connectivity a Human Right?,” in which he said that bringing the world’s population online would be “one of the most important things we all do in our lifetimes.”

That optimism may be cold comfort to people in places like South Sudan. Despite being one of the poorest and least-wired countries in the world, with only around 20 percent of its citizens connected to the internet, the African nation has become a hotbed of social media misinformation. As BuzzFeed News has reported, political operatives inside and outside the country have used Facebook posts to spread rumors and incite anger between rival factions, fostering violence that threatens to escalate into a civil war. A United Nations report last year determined that in South Sudan, “social media has been used by partisans on all sides, including some senior government officials, to exaggerate incidents, spread falsehoods and veiled threats, or post outright messages of incitement.”

These are incredibly complex issues, and it may be impossible for Facebook — which is, remember, a technology company, not a global peacekeeping force — to solve them overnight. But as the company’s response to the Russia crisis has proved, it’s capable of acting swiftly and powerfully when it feels its interests are threatened.

Information wars in emerging markets may not represent as big a threat to Facebook’s business as angry lawmakers in Washington.

On my last night on the job, I drank on the line, like most everyone else. Everything from there is unclear, because — from what I was able to gather — one of the cooks had drugged my drink. Apparently, a crew of colleagues, all but one of them men, took me to a house to “party” after work. I’ve been told that the man who drugged me tried to take me home with him, but the other woman who’d come along prevented this. I got into a bed, and some other guy decided to do what he liked with me.

I do not remember this. I reported the assault to the police, but could never bring myself to ask for specifics. The handprint-shaped bruise I had on my thigh gave me enough to think about.

For a long time, I couldn’t believe I had been so stupid. How could I have missed that I was in a dangerous place?

Here’s how: I bought into the idea that talk in the kitchen was just talk, and that a thick skin would indeed protect me. But it wasn’t and it didn’t, because a sexualized workplace is a dangerous workplace for women. When the entire culture of a place is lewd, it makes it impossible to tell which men are dangerous. The raunchiest man in the kitchen had no part in the assault, but a quieter cook apparently did. In the din of dirty kitchen-speak, I could not have told you the difference between them.

The urgency of this problem was harder to see a generation ago, when kitchens were relatively marginal workplaces. That is no longer the case. Today restaurants are central to our culture and our economy. As the cult of celebrity chefs has grown, annual restaurant sales have more than doubled since 2001 to just under $800 billion. The National Restaurant Association says its industry employs nearly one-tenth of all workers. Last year, restaurant jobs exceeded 9.1 million, more than half held by women. This makes restaurants mainstream, professional workplaces, and that is true for both a social media manager for the Besh restaurants, or a teenage server at an IHOP.

Whatever degree of glamour in a particular job, harassment in restaurants is nearly universal. Two-thirds of female restaurant workers reported experiencing sexual harassment from management in a 2014 survey, and 80 percent reported it from co-workers, according to research from advocacy group Restaurant Opportunities Center United. The most common type reported was the kind of sexual teasing and jokes that had preceded my assault. Most women responded the same way I did: They ignored it.

Women ignore such behavior out of self-preservation, but men ignore it because it is easy and acceptable to do so. It sounds as if that was the strategy for Mr. Bourdain, who gave an interview to Slate last week. Around bro culture, he said, “I was so uncomfortable.” But when it came to being the bad boy, he also “played that role and went along with it.” So have most male chefs and food writers.

Another point worth pondering is how it is that President Trump chose as his campaign chair someone like Manafort whose reputation in the political world was less about his political brilliance than about his ties to Russia and Ukraine (including some of the most corrupt people there) and his general shadiness. It’s said that Jared Kushner was among those advocating to hire Manafort, so the obvious question is: Why?

Maybe there simply wasn’t adequate vetting, even though news organizations quickly found problems that led to Manafort’s firing. But the inclination to hire someone so close to Moscow does raise questions about the Trump inner circle’s predilection to hire someone linked to Russia and Ukraine.

We’re still not sure whether there was collusion between President Trump and Russia, but we certainly do know that Russia interfered with the U.S. election and may even have affected the outcome, although that is impossible to know for sure. Nothing could be more serious, or more deserving of careful investigation.

President Trump tweeted this morning that there was “no collusion” and again urged greater focus on the supposed crimes of Hillary Clinton. By that he presumably means the uranium deal, which has conservatives in a frenzy—but it is simply absurd to think that there is some parallel.

Look, it was The Times that in 2015 helped uncover and publicize the uranium arrangement, but it has been flagrantly taken out of context by Fox News and its ilk. For starters, there seems to be a suspicion on the right that American uranium is going to Russia, while in fact there’s no export license—so the uranium stays in America. More important, this was a non-controversial deal that an interagency committee approved, apparently unanimously, at a level far below Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Every bit of evidence says that Clinton never even weighed in on it. So the notion that this is somehow a serious scandal parallel to Moscow’s work to overturn an American presidential election is just comical.

One peril ahead is that President Trump may engage in riskier or more aggressive behavior vis-à-vis North Korea so that people will rally around the flag. Another is that Trump will fire Mueller. This would be difficult for him to do, because (opinions vary) he might have to do this through the Justice Department framework, leading to another Archibald Cox-style massacre of reluctant intermediaries. But it would also be a body blow to the rule of law in America, and it would trigger a Constitutional crisis.

Any firing of Mueller would lead many fair-minded people to assume that Trump is hiding criminal behavior, perhaps treason. There would be a push for impeachment, a boost to Congressional investigations, and the presidency would be hobbled—along with the United States itself—for years to come. Trump set in motion today’s actions when he fired James Comey, and I hope he understands that firing Mueller would probably also set in motion the complete unraveling of his presidency.",Will Manafort Sing?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/paul-manafort-indictment-trump.html

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

Photo

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

After struggling for almost two decades to get funding for the project, he returned to the island in 2014 to explore the rain forests and crystal clear creek where Dr. Hossfeld had discovered the skull 85 years earlier.

Dr. Hossfeld had left detailed notes about where he had found the skull, which helped guide Dr. Goff and his team as they collected samples from the same sediment layer at a nearby river-cut cliff. Back at the lab, they performed geochemical analysis to determine whether the sediment level had been deposited by a tsunami 6,000 years ago.

Because they had previously analyzed geochemical signals from sediment on the island following the 1998 tsunami, the team knew which clues to look for, like grain size and composition.

They found that the sediment collected from the skull site contained fossilized deep sea diatoms. These microscopic organisms were a telltale sign that ocean water had drowned the area at some point.

The researchers also found geochemical signals that matched the signatures they collected in 1998, offering additional evidence that a tsunami had struck around 6,000 years ago. “Bang! Right where the diatoms were looking very sexy and you’re getting excited, you have a signal that says, ‘Hi, I’m seawater,’” said Dr. Goff.

He said the findings checked all the boxes for a tragic tsunami tale. “Yes, this was a tsunami. And yes, this is most probably a tsunami victim, and he or she is the oldest one we know.”

Sue Dawson, a geographer the University of Dundee in Scotland who studies tsunami sedimentation, said that the team’s diatom evidence was similar to what she found examining sediments in Papua New Guinea after the 1998 tsunami and could be suggestive of a tsunami flooding the area.

But she added that the findings do not rule out that the skull could have belonged to someone who died before the tsunami occurred and whose grave was disturbed by the event.

Ethan Cochrane, an archaeologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and an author of the paper, questioned that alternative scenario.

“Tsunamis do not rip up the ground enough to remove already buried bodies and put them into suspension and transport them,” he said, pointing to findings from rescue efforts with recent tsunamis. “Overwhelmingly, the dead you find were killed by the tsunami.”

The geochemistry analysis supported the authors’ conclusions, another scientist not involved in the study said, although he added that it didn’t contribute much to our understanding of the dangers posed by tsunamis.

In discussing Wentz, Hasselbeck recalled a spirited conversation he had with his ESPN colleague, the Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.
“You earn your money on third down and then the red zone,” Hasselbeck said.
The Eagles demonstrated conviction in moving up to draft Wentz with the No.
The good news for Wentz, and the Eagles, is that if another does fall, he probably wouldn’t even realize it.","No one here has anointed Wentz as an amalgam of Andrew Luck and Brett Favre, or petitioned to rename the state as Wentzylvania, or pricing flights to Minneapolis — site of a certain big game that rhymes with Grouper Roll — for early February.

Nah, nothing like that.

Witness the power of Wentz, whose development in his second season has accelerated the Eagles’ revival. His obliviousness — to the mounting attention, not just Hasselbeck’s second act in broadcasting — is what can sustain it.

“I don’t want to say robotic,” right tackle Lane Johnson said, “but he’s just consistent — really, really consistent.”

Before Sunday, when Philadelphia kept the San Francisco 49ers winless by bludgeoning them, 33-10, under steady rain at Lincoln Financial Field, Wentz had thrown at least three touchdown passes in each of his last three games. He mustered only two in what he called a sluggish performance against San Francisco, running his season total to 19, staying on pace to shatter the franchise’s season record of 32.

Sonny Jurgensen set the mark in 1961, and the Eagles have had some pretty fair quarterbacks since then: Ron Jaworski, Randall Cunningham and, best of them all, Donovan McNabb, who in his prime — with rare exceptions — afforded the Eagles at least one certainty heading into every game: that they would have the advantage at quarterback.

Wentz has not earned that distinction yet, but the Eagles are enamored with how quickly he seems to be getting there.

In truth, they are enamored with most things now, from their win-loss record to their red-zone efficiency (68 percent) to their ferocious defense, which sacked 49ers quarterback C. J. Beathard four times, hit him 12 more, and also forced a three-and-out or a turnover on eight of San Francisco’s 14 possessions. On one of those takeaways, Jalen Mills returned an interception 37 yards for a touchdown.

“If you’re enjoying your first real dominant season as a team, no one’s going to show up on Sunday and take it for granted,” defensive end Chris Long said. “We haven’t been here before, so let’s build on it.”

The Eagles’ joy ride in this muddled N.F.C., where the Los Angeles Rams and Minnesota Vikings are soaring and the Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys are sagging, has been tempered by several injuries: linebacker Jordan Hicks, running back Darren Sproles and the All-Pro left tackle Jason Peters are all done for the season.

Philadelphia’s defense, which entered Sunday as the league’s stingiest against the run, is capable of continuing to mitigate these absences.

So is Wentz.

In discussing Wentz, Hasselbeck recalled a spirited conversation he had with his ESPN colleague, the Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. Hasselbeck has come to espouse Young’s evaluation of quarterbacks: How a quarterback fares between the 20-yard lines doesn’t matter.

“You earn your money on third down and then the red zone,” Hasselbeck said. “On third down, this team is relying on you to be this amazing marinara sauce on yesterday’s pasta. Guess what, we don’t have a good answer. Here’s the answer: You make a perfect throw.”

Through Week 8, Philadelphia ranks second in third-down conversion rate (47.8) in large part because of Wentz’s improved precision — his placement in tight spaces, in particular — but also because of his ability to prolong plays with his elusiveness, whether by finding open receivers when coverages break down or scrambling to extend the drive. His eight touchdown tosses and 118.8 passer rating on third down lead the N.F.L., according to the sports data service Sportradar. In the red zone, his 13 touchdowns — including a 1-yarder to Zach Ertz, his favorite target, on Sunday — also lead the league.

The Eagles demonstrated conviction in moving up to draft Wentz with the No. 2 pick in 2016. Their trade partner, the Cleveland Browns, did not even think Wentz was among the top 20 quarterbacks in the draft. In a somewhat related note, the Browns are 1-26 in their last 27 games.

(Should we mention that on draft night this year Cleveland traded the No. 12 pick to the Houston Texans, who selected Deshaun Watson, who as a rookie has thrown 19 touchdowns in seven games? No? O.K.)

All told, though, the Eagles’ talent on offense at the time of the 2016 draft was comparable to that of Cleveland’s, maybe even worse. They responded by surrounding Wentz with better players, adding running back LeGarrette Blount and receivers Torrey Smith and Alshon Jeffery, who contorted to catch a jump ball along the sideline Sunday that turned into a 53-yard touchdown.

Wentz has also benefited from a full off-season of preparation within Coach Doug Pederson’s system. Remember: Just 14 months ago, before being elevated after Philadelphia shipped Sam Bradford to Minnesota, Wentz ranked behind Chase Daniel on the depth chart.

A career understudy, Pederson became so adept at decoding defenses from the sideline, Hasselbeck said, that Brett Favre dubbed him The Front Doctor. From backing up Favre — and also Dan Marino, Steve Bono and Jim McMahon — Pederson said he had observed how they communicated with coaches, talking about play calls and game situations.

Pederson welcomes that continuing dialogue with Wentz, who carries enough influence and has engendered enough trust that not only can he recommend plays from his time at North Dakota State — he said he had to call there to get the film — but execute them for touchdowns, as he did on a madcap third-down throw to Corey Clement last week against Washington.

The Eagles’ victory Sunday lacked such scintillating moments. The weather was ugly, at times the play was, too, and some of Wentz’s poor throws — he missed an open Jeffery in the end zone — could have prompted the fatalists in the crowd to lapse into that familiar emotion roused whenever something good happens in Philadelphia sports: enthusiasm tinged by the resignation that Wentz will soon be walking beneath a plummeting piano.

Ms. Hasegawa tackles that question in “Japanorama.” Having previously presented Japanese contemporary art in Brazil, Britain and Germany, she “looked very carefully at the past 10-15 years: what was organized, what kind of Japanese contemporary art has been collected in public institutions in Europe.” She continued: “I want to bring awareness to context behind what people misunderstand, to the social commentary behind the works.”

Ms. Hasegawa’s vast and thoughtful synopsis encompasses six themes (called “archipelagos”) that bridge art, architecture, video, fashion and music. She porously connects movements and multimedia across two floors, with a mise-en-scène conceived by the Tokyo architects SANAA. (The Pompidou Center Metz itself was designed by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban).

The first section, “Strange Object/Post-Human Body,” confronts visitors with “Electric Dress,” a multicolored cluster of lights, created in 1956 by Atsuko Tanaka, that prefigures today’s evolving relationship between the physical and the digital. The piece resonates with Comme des Garçons garments on display, which present an alternative approach to Western ideas of beauty and body image.

Rhizomatiks contributes a visualization of Bitcoin’s blockchain system rejigged according to live transactions, in a digital ballet that shows a forward-looking evolution of Japanese creativity.

Within the Pop Art sphere, Ms. Hasegawa has highlighted works with a strong conceptual background and Japanese specificity. She wishes to undercut the way in which Japanese pop culture is often understood as sunny or silly: The graphic kitsch is, in fact, inherently critical, she says. “It’s vernacular — but also very sophisticated,” she added. The artist Takashi Murakami’s work in this vein, is perhaps the most well-known, but it is also the most misunderstood. The painted smileys of his “Cosmos” are not just bright and fun — the composition owes everything to 18th-century Edo paintings. His lesser-known “Polyrhythm Red” canvas, adorned with Tamiya soldier figurines, reflects, Ms. Hasegawa said, “Japanese culture becoming childish,” and a malaise about violence and vulnerability.

The exhibition also overturns the seeming naïveté of “kawaii,” Japan’s signature brand of cute, to reveal assertions of sociopolitical frustration. A 2002 kimono using Bingata, the traditional dyed fabric of Okinawa — where the artist Yuken Teruya grew up, near a United States Army base — is especially striking. The cheery flowers and trees on the garment are, upon closer inspection, composed of fighter planes and parachutes.

The exhibition concludes with a section on “Materiality and Minimalism,” highlighting examples such as Hiroshi Sugimoto’s calm photographs of horizon lines and Ryoji Ikeda’s trancelike work based on numerical data. “It’s a landing,” Ms. Hasegawa said of the exhibition’s finale, to “look at something sublime.”

Kohei Nawa’s breathtaking “Force,” an installation of viscous black silicone oil, which rains down without making a splash, appears soothing, but this is deceptive: Its subject is radioactive fallout. Like many works in “Japanorama,” it shows that simple does not mean straightforward, that beautiful things can contain disquieting fears.

To grapple with these nuances requires being open to another perspective. In this sense, the show’s most emblematic piece is by the artist Shimabuku. His video “Then, I Decided to Give a Tour of Tokyo to the Octopus from Akashi,” is as gently funny as it is affecting. He collects an octopus from his hometown and brings it to the metropolis on the bullet train — takes it to the fish market, introduces it to another octopus there — and eventually releases it back into the sea. It’s a fitting narrative for visitors to the exhibition, who, at the end, are returned to their usual setting, more enlightened for having explored an unfamiliar territory.","Japanese Art, on Its Own Terms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/design/japanese-art-on-its-own-terms.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

An announcement could come as soon as Thursday, ahead of the president’s 12-day trip to Asia.

Mr. Powell, a Fed governor since 2012, is a Republican with deep roots in the party’s establishment and in the financial industry. He has steadily supported the Fed’s current approach to monetary policy and financial regulation, creating an expectation that he would bring continuity to the role.

A United States District Court judge on Monday blocked a White House policy barring military service by transgender troops, noting that the policy did not appear to be based on facts, but instead on “a desire to express disapproval of transgender people generally.”

President Trump announced in a series of tweets in July that American forces could not afford the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of transgender troops, and said “the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” A presidential memorandum released in August required all transgender service members to be discharged by March.

Transgender groups sued the administration in late August on behalf of transgender service members, arguing that the ban was discriminatory and violated their constitutional right to due process equal protection under the law.

The council also asked for recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through parliamentary action, though that was vaguely defined.

The term “recognition” has proven to be loaded both legally and politically, as it could range from a symbolic inclusion in Australia’s Constitution, to the granting of a degree of autonomy, as seen with Indigenous people in Canada and Russia.

The government said its dismissal of the idea was rooted in what it saw as two flawed notions: that the establishment of an Indigenous body — advisory or otherwise — separate from Parliament would have been consistent with democratic principles, and that the proposal could have succeeded in a national referendum.

“We have rejected something that was simply not going to get up,” Nigel Scullion, Australia’s minister for Indigenous Affairs, said Thursday in an interview on Thursday.

Mr. Scullion said the proposal would have had “zero chance of success” in such a vote. When asked what evidence he had for that assertion, Mr. Scullion responded, “I don’t need evidence.”

But Professor Davis pushed back on both of the government’s reasons, saying that the government was distorting the role of the proposed Indigenous body, and that the assumption that the referendum would fail had no scientific polling to support it.

The proposal was written up as the Uluru Statement of the Heart: a formal call for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to have a representative body and a process for treaties. Hundreds of Indigenous leaders contributed in formulating the proposal.

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

Photo

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.","1. Start With the Monday Puzzles

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

While virtual-reality pornography may feel like something out of a science fiction movie, it already has a formidable, if underground, presence. According to website Pornhub, views of VR porn are up 275 percent since it debuted in the summer of 2016. Now the site is averaging about 500,000 views (on Christmas Day in 2016, this number shot up to 900,000.)

By 2025 pornography will be the third-largest VR sector, according to estimates prepared by Piper Jaffray, an investment and management firm. Only video games and N.F.L.-related content will be larger, it predicted, and the market will be worth $1 billion.

“We’re getting more and more of it every day,” said Mark Kernes, a senior editor at AVN Media Network, which covers the industry. “We are leading the technology in this area. Sex sells, and where there is money to be made, there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it,” some by offering it for free to increase clicks.

Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press, and spurred developments in the internet, online payment systems and other technology. Now it’s time for virtual reality, Mr. Kernes said: “I’m pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.”

Headsets Are Just the Beginning

Ms. Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3, a conference for the video-game industry. Excited by the pornography possibilities, she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star. Before long, Ms. Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles.

She was one of the first VR webcam women, according to Mr. Kernes. She then started a company named VRTube.xxx, which now employs over 40 performers.

Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate, considering the potential for abuse, disease and exploitation, the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues. For example, can you use someone’s likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality?

“Virtual reality is like the Wild Wild West,” said Bryony Cole, the host of “Future of Sex,” a podcast that explores technology and sexuality.

At this year’s AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas, the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display.

CamSoda, a website that specializes in live sex videos, had an exhibit featuring pornography stars dressed in plunging bathing suits and waving visitors into the booth. They were showing off OhRama, a small canister that attaches to virtual reality headsets and releases scent during the action. “Believe it or not, the scents were created by the girls,” said Mr. Kernes, who was there. “It’s sweet and musty. They know what they like.”

There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience.

Another big player is CamasutraVR, a start-up using 142 cameras that all look at one person, or one body part. “They are creating images from that, which they are hoping will be indistinguishable from an actual person,” Mr. Kernes said. “I’m sure those people wished they had been using that VR system at home.”

Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material. “As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator,” he said.

One of the most buzzed-about inventions has been the sex robot. The first one, Harmony, was introduced in May by a company named Realbotix. In seductive videos posted on YouTube, Harmony shows off her long legs, her firm breasts, her full lips, her lifelike hand gestures, even her intellect.

“How do you feel about sex?” an unknown presenter asks her in one video.

“Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world,” she responds in a raspy voice. “I don’t see anything wrong with it.” Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space; she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching.

“It’s a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi,” said Matt McMullen, the C.E.O. and creative director of Realbotix. The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality. “Based on our experiences with thousands of clients,” Mr. McMullen said, “people do use them for sex, but there is something more that exists. We focus on companionship.”

Virtual reality has been nicknamed the empathy machine because it allows people to feel like they are truly connected to the action. “It’s neurological,” said Holly Richmond, a somatic psychologist based in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. “You aren’t just watching and thinking about it. You are feeling it, and it’s not just your genitals. There is literally a mind-body connection.”

When Ms. Darling does live X-rated performances, users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen. “The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off,” she said. “They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.”

Many sex therapists and educators are interested in the new technology, just as a dentist might be with the latest plaque-detection gizmos. Ms. Richmond worked with BaDoinkVR, a virtual-reality company in Rochester, N.Y., to create Virtual Sexology, a series of free videos that help men and women overcome common sex problems.

A recent video, updated in June, takes women into the bedroom where they see how one blond, busty woman arouses herself before sex. She sits in front of her partner massaging her arms, her legs, her breasts. As her breathing heats up, a voice-over says that some women need to be physically touched before feeling any desire for sex. The first video, aimed at men, was the most downloaded video on BaDoinkVR.com in 2016 — an impressive feat considering it was competing with noneducational pornography.

Ms. Cole, the podcast host, is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education.

“What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?” she said. “Or they can be in a room with someone who said, ‘I contacted herpes and this is my experience.’ That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.”

Indeed.

Barbara Rothbaum, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emory’s Veterans Program, is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma.

The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks, tents, private living quarters, latrines, offices or remote buildings and vehicles, where the trauma may have taken place. The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace.

But for virtual reality to work, the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality. They have to feel like they are participants, not just observers. “We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them,” Ms. Cole said. As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen, issues are bound to arise.

Mr. McCullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize. His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used.

Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire. “What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?” she said. “What does consent mean in virtual reality? Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldn’t do in real life? If you are using someone’s likeness in virtual reality, do you require their permission? And what about revenge porn? That will be even harsher in virtual reality.”

She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps, drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters.

Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating. It is, after all, much more lifelike than traditional pornography.

But Mr. McCullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that, but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation, not causing it. “There are people who are already lonely, and people who live their lives being alone. They work all day and come home to an empty house,” he said. “This is just offering an alternative to those types of people. They don’t have anyone else.”",Virtual Reality Gets Naughty,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/style/virtual-reality-porn.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The Hamar, numbering 45,000 throughout the valley, are known to be pastoralists. The village was overflowing with cattle. As in Dus, the dwellings were simple, built of sticks and grass, and well ordered. Young men tended cattle while a woman skinned and butchered a goat with the help of her toddler, who hung pieces of the animal on a fence beside an AK-47 and a belt of ammo.

“The AK-47 has replaced the spear,” Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Biwa nodded. “As long as you have AK, you are respected,” he said. “Your family feels safe and proud. Someone with no AK, people look down on them. If you do not have AK your family will go to someone who does.”

They were American-made, I was told, gathered during the war in neighboring Sudan.

But they are not cheap,” Mr. Biwa said.

“How much do they cost?” I asked.

“Five cows,” he said.

Beside firearms, I witnessed few other accommodations to the contemporary world in the Omo. Yet for a place so far off the grid, news traveled fast throughout the valley. While in the Hamar village we heard word of a nearby bull-jumping ceremony. The bull jump is a ritual initiation to manhood for both the Hamar and Karo communities. We headed east.

At the end of a long, deeply rutted road we came upon a dusty village in the midst of a celebration. Old men and women gathered in the shade. Young men painted their faces red and white. Young women were draped in skirts and wore large bells wrapped around their calves. Their hair was ornately done in rings caked with ochre-colored mud. Each carried a small horn and blew it incessantly.

When one young woman turned away from me I noticed fresh welts on her bare back, dripping blood; she seemed unaware and continued to dance. Then I saw her approach a young man, stand close in front of him, and blow her horn in his face. She began to jump up and down, her bells clanging, her horn blaring. The young man bent to the ground and picked up a long switch and raised it over his head. The woman blew her horn more insistently, then suddenly stopped. She stared at the young man. He struck her with the whip, which snapped around her body and lashed across her back with a sharp cracking sound. She did not flinch. She lifted her horn, blew it in his face and danced away, fresh blood rising on her back. The same performance was repeated again and again by many of the young women. Their backs were covered in old scars and new welts, yet none of them displayed any outward signs of pain.

As the sun was setting, a dozen bulls were led to a clearing and aligned flank to flank. The women clustered together and began jumping, their bells ringing out, their horns blasting. Others began to chant. Suddenly a naked young man leapt up on the back of the first bull and raced across the spine of each. He jumped down after the last bull, but then he was up again, racing across their backs in the other direction. He repeated the back-and-forth exercise three times. If he fell it would be a disgrace he would carry for life, Mr. Biwa had warned me. But the youth never faltered — the next morning he would awake a man, able to sit among the elders.

The women continued to blow their horns and the celebration continued on into the night. We drove away under a moonless sky, the Southern Cross hanging low, silence filling our car.

The next morning we headed up river to a small village of the Nyangatom people. Relations between Karo and Nyangatom have long been strained. Intertribal conflicts over cattle rustling and grazing land have kept the valley bristling with internal strife for decades, passed down from generation to generation, Mr. Biwa said.

“Where we are going, this was our land until 15 years ago,” Mr. Biwa said as he throttled our engine through the brown water. “The Nyangatom are fierce fighters. They pushed us across the river. Our women tell us we are weak. Not just with their words. They dance — in front of everyone. It is a shame we wear.”

We passed large crocodiles cooling themselves on the muddy banks, their jaws resting open. Black-and-white colobus monkeys leapt from branches of fig trees. A dugout canoe sat unattended on the riverbank. A Goliath heron lumbered into the air.

In time the heavy foliage lining the river thinned, then grew sparse. Thirty-foot cliffs began to rise up and the landscape turned parched. Ahead, on the west bank, bony cattle were drinking from the river, kicking a choking dust high into the sky and across the sun, casting everything in an eerie patina. Atop the cliff, two men stood sentry. One had an AK-47 slung from his shoulder; the other wore what in a more urban setting might have been called a hipster hat. The tribes wore a mishmash of clothing — brightly colored traditional wraps, animal skins and adornments, mixed freely with Chelsea football jerseys, rakish caps and fatigue shorts — creating an all too apt picture of Africa’s disparate influences, all vying for dominance.

The men on the cliff greeted us with stares, and we set out across the arid land. Distant hills of Kenya were visible to the south. Three young girls with water jugs balancing on their heads silently caught up with us. One carried the designs of scarification — small, raised scars created by rubbing charcoal in deliberately administered cuts, causing the skin to welt in intricate patterns. They made this two-mile walk to and from the river twice daily — in Africa carrying water is women’s work.

At the outskirts of the village, a half-dozen expressionless men loitered. The tallest sported a vaguely military-looking beret, worn at a jaunty angle, and an AK-47. The rest held long sticks. Some wore rubber sandals made from scavenged truck ties; the others were barefoot.

Many Nyangatom are seminomadic and this village appeared haphazardly thrown together, as if built in a rush, without care. There was no central meeting area, no sense of organization. Children did not rush to greet us. We huddled with the men in the scant shade of a scraggly date tree. Cigarettes were passed around and smoked.

Photo

In time, more than a dozen women emerged from the honeycomb-shaped dwellings that looked as if they could neither contain nor shelter life. One old woman began to chant, then just as suddenly stopped. All wore heavy ropes of beaded necklaces piled high and were wrapped from the waist in once colorful cloth, and several held small children. Fatigue hung in the blistering heat. It would have been difficult to imagine daily life clinging closer to the edge of existence.

“The cradle of mankind is no Garden of Eden,” Mr. Jones said softly as we tracked back cross the barren land to the boat.

Back down the river, the mood was more celebratory — a ceremony was underway in Dus. Two hundred men from Mr. Biwa’s Karo community were gathering in a large semicircle on a bluff above the river. Seating was arranged from the youngest to the most senior elder. I was offered a spot in the dirt much too far along the timeline for my liking.

A bull was being roasted over an open fire in the center of the gathering. Three men with machetes hacked the animal to pieces. Chunks of meat and fat, clinging to large bones, were deposited onto small beds of leaves before the assembled. A part of the animal I couldn’t identify was dropped in front of me. The old man beside me with heavily pierced ears and a pointed stick protruding below his lower lip offered me his knife. He watched as I sliced into the mysterious blob, then grinned as I put it in my mouth. Just beyond the circle a dozen hooded vultures gathered.

When the entire animal had been consumed, one of the elders got up and began to speak.

“He is making a prayer for the river to rise,” Mr. Biwa told me.",Up Close With the Tribes of Ethiopia’s Imperiled Omo Valley,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/travel/omo-valley-ethiopia-eco-tourism.html

Mr. Papadopoulos alerted his supervisor and several members of the foreign policy team about his contacts, referring to his “good friend” the professor and a woman he called Mr. Putin’s niece. The campaign supervisor — who was not identified in the documents — said in response that he would “work it through the campaign” and added “Great work.”

The Justice Department said that Mr. Papadopoulos had hurt their investigation.

“Through his false statements and omissions, defendant Papadopoulos impeded the F.B.I.’s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the Campaign and the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,” the documents said.",Trump Campaign Adviser Met With Russian to Discuss ‘Dirt’ on Clinton,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/george-papadopoulos-russia.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

He said the controversy had begun to detract from the work being done to restore power on the island.

Soon after the deal with Whitefish was announced, questions were raised as to how a two-man company from Montana managed to secure such a lucrative contract. The company has ties to the secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, but both sides say there was no wrongdoing.

A House committee is investigating, and the governor has asked the island’s comptroller and the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security to also review the deal.

The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported Monday that F.B.I. agents from the San Juan field office are investigating the contract, but such an investigation could not be confirmed.

The F.B.I. national office referred questions about the report to the Puerto Rico field office. A spokesman there, Carlos Osorio, said the agency could not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation.

A spokeswoman for the power authority said the agency had no information about an investigation, and therefore had no comment.

The governor’s office said it welcomed an inquiry.

“We have not received any information about the F.B.I. looking into the contract, but Governor Rosselló welcomes any investigation by the federal authorities and he has been clear: there should be an investigation on this matter, and if there is any wrongdoing, the persons responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” said Yennifer Álvarez, the governor’s spokeswoman. “That’s why the Governor has asked for investigations by the Comptroller of Puerto Rico and the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, John Roth.”

In a phone interview, Ms. Farha, an independent expert reporting to the United Nations, said it was “very worrying” that she had not been able to obtain clarity on the number of people who were still homeless after the storm. She noted that estimates of the number of houses destroyed ranged from 30,000 to 90,000.

Thousands of engineers had been deployed in Texas and Florida to reconnect homes to the electricity grid after hurricanes hit those states, a number far in excess of the crews deployed to Puerto Rico.

“FEMA is overall responsible,” Ms. Farha said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “I don’t understand why FEMA can respond so quickly and affirmatively in Texas and why they weren’t deployed similarly in Puerto Rico.”

MONDAY PUZZLE — Jay Kaskel takes us another step closer to the most boo-tiful day of the year with a puzzle about a stereotypical witch.

First Witch: When shall we three meet again

In thunder, lightning, or in rain? Second Witch: When the hurly-burly’s done,

When the battle’s lost and won. — Macbeth, Act I, Scene 1

Today’s Theme

Four phrases are reinterpreted as things that might be in the life of a witch. For example, witches cast spells, so “Computer help for a witch?” would be SPELL CHECK. Similarly, WARTS AND ALL at 41A is “How one might be forced to accept a witch?” because a witch has at least one wart. (Practitioners of witchcraft, please do not write to me objecting to this. I know you do not have warts. We’re talking about the cartoon stereotype.)

Tricky Clues

61A: If you are knowledgeable about poetry, KEATS might have been a gimme. I had John DONNE at first, but I know enough about cooking to know that a “Stir-fry vessel” is not a WOD, it’s a WOK.

19D: We’re talking about slang for money here. “Bill worth 100 smackers” is a C SPOT, which must be very rare, since multitudes of relationship experts have written about trying to find it.

Constructor Notes

I originally set out to create a Halloween-themed puzzle that incorporated all the familiar characters associated with Halloween: witches, ghosts, skeletons, vampires and zombies. But the theme never felt tight enough. After a while, I settled on a witch/BROOM HILDA-themed puzzle and sent it off. While Will liked the idea, he felt young solvers might not be familiar with the character. So not only did I have to replace BROOM HILDA at 58-Across, I had to do some serious re-cluing (CHARM SCHOOL, for example, was clued as “Educational institution attended by 58-Across?”) Here’s where things got tricky. One of the original theme entries was WITCH HUNT, which meant I couldn’t use the word “witch” in the clues. “Educational institution attended by a Halloween broom-rider” just didn’t do the trick. It felt too forced. In the end, I simply dropped WITCH HUNT as an answer, and thankfully Will was O.K. with the puzzle having just four main fills. As always, I can’t tell you how much of a treat it is to see one of my puzzles in The New York Times.

The Democrats are undergoing a historic transformation, from being the party that embraced neoliberalism in the early 1990s to one that is rejecting that centrist posture and moving left. There’s plenty about this to cheer — the neoliberal Democratic Party didn’t do nearly enough to try to arrest growing income inequality, among other shortcomings.

There will be necessary internecine fights, and they boil down to loyalty tests on particular positions demanded by the vanguard. Consider the debate within the party on Senator Bernie Sanders’s “Medicare for All” bill, which most (though not all) 2020 contenders rushed to attach themselves to. To fail to sign on to that legislation is to open oneself to criticism, even abuse, although it’s less a piece of legislation than a goal.

Forget about who’s right and wrong in these debates. Time will sort that out. My point is that they tend to consume a party experiencing a shift. The Democratic Party, because it is an amalgam of interest groups in a way the Republican Party is not, has always had a tendency to elevate the candidate who can check the most boxes. The current internal dynamics exacerbate that. It’s also worth remembering that no one besides party activists cares.

So when the party’s leaders tussle over this or that policy, they also need to take a step back, to see the direction the country — the West itself — is heading, and take a stand on it. This isn’t just a matter of high-minded idealism; it’s what separates great politicians from merely good ones.

History tells us that the transformative politicians, the ones who can change the country’s direction and will really matter in the history books, are the ones who can do both. I think there have been four of them in the past century: Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Why Roosevelt and Reagan should be obvious. I know some would dispute my choice of Mr. Clinton, but he rescued a party that had lost three presidential elections in a row and was being read last rites by some pundits in 1991 (the extent to which he changed the country’s fundamental direction is debatable). Mr. Obama made history and redrew the electoral map. All four were able to speak both to their base and beyond it by identifying the challenge of the moment and persuading majorities that they had some answers.

The future of the Western democratic project is the fundamental issue of our era. It’s under attack from Vladimir Putin and Steve Bannon and many people in between (and to the extent that he backs Mr. Bannon’s purge of the Republican Party, from the president himself; think about that).

Democrats can’t duck this question and expect the broader electorate to see them as prepared to lead. To his credit, Mr. Sanders did talk a bit about all this in a foreign-policy speech in late September at the same Missouri college where Winston Churchill gave his Iron Curtain speech, noting an “international order” that is “under great strain.”

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Photo

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

So when the owners of East River Tattoo fired back on Instagram, posting a screen shot of the Yelp review beside a caption that said, “Proud to be shattering your expectations of what a tattoo shop should be, every day of the week,” obviously an army of Sade obsessives rushed to the store’s side.

“All that says is your understanding of the world and what’s happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol,” one wrote.

Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet. But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.

This impact includes tattoos. More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adu’s visage over the last year or so. A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than they’d gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.

The most famous Sade tattoo, however, belongs to Drake. He premiered it on Instagram this March. In it, Ms. Adu’s hair is hidden, Nina Simone-like, beneath a turban.

In February 2017, the street wear brand Supreme put Ms. Adu’s image on a coveted limited-edition T-shirt. In March, Reese Witherspoon’s Type A character on “Big Little Lies” established her remove from pop culture when she hears Sade at a dinner party and mistakes it for Adele.

Demand for T-shirts from Sade’s 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chico’s Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.

Some of this Sade fever can be traced to Patrick Matamoros, 41, a high-end dealer who finds rare T-shirts, distresses them to perfection and then places them on to the backs of celebrity clients such as Rihanna, Diplo and Mark Ronson.

Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sade’s 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West. “I’d sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still don’t understand,” Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.

This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.

He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.

“I used to say to people about Sade, ‘This isn’t going to impress everyone in the room,” Mr. Matamoros said. “Get an Iron Maiden shirt if that’s what you want. Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.”

Photo

Not anymore. Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.

Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name. (Many Americans believe it’s pronounced Shar-day; it’s Sha-day.) In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sade’s disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.

Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.

For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the world’s most prestigious fashion school. To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the band’s “Love Deluxe” and “Lover’s Rock” albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.

She began singing backup in a local band, and moved to frontwoman only reluctantly. “The lead singer left,” she later said.

It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride. They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.

In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.

They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.

“She was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now,” said Susan Blond, a former vice president and publicity director at Epic who now heads an agency where clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.

“She was very young, but she was very sophisticated,” Ms. Blond said. “She didn’t follow anyone else’s style. No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her. She didn’t mind designer clothes, but you’d never ever look at her and say, ‘Oh that’s a Chanel outfit.’ She never looked like a brand. And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.”

In a way, Ms. Adu’s sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.

When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, “Smooth Operator,” she was lamenting what happens when “sentiment is left to chance.”

The saxophone signaled sorrow. Ms. Adu wasn’t asking — as Ms. Jones did — for a guy to “drive it in between.”

Shortly before Sade won the 1986 Grammy for best new artist, she appeared on “Saturday Night Live” with Tom Hanks, who recalled the experience in an email: “It was the first time I did ‘SNL,’ which is a major event an anyone’s life, a heady week of being surrounded by all that history. I’d never been in 30 Rock, much less invited to work on the 17th floor or in Studio 8-H. I thought the big talisman for being on ‘SNL’ was the job of saying ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, Sade.’ which is actually written on a cue card, by the way.’

Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence. Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade. She remains a Smooth Operator, no?”

Dan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sade’s first four albums, said, “There was grace to everything she did.”

Although Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasn’t because she was temperamental or diva-ish.

She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion. She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.

“She never enjoyed promotion of any type,” Mr. Beck said. “It was painful for her. Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal. I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period. I said, ‘You’ll hate it but we’ll get it all done and when you’re done you’re done.’ And she laughed, and that’s what we did for the next two albums after that.”

(She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turner’s career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)

As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer. She wanted to have normal relationships. She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.

Sade’s 1992 album, “Love Deluxe,” arrived four years after “Stronger Than Pride.” Ms. Adu smiled as she told Mr. Beck she might not have gone back into the studio to record — except the guys in the band wanted to return to work, he said. “I thought that was so sweet.” (In a 1992 interview she said, “It’s good that we stopped and didn’t try to make another one off the back of the previous album. You get some perspective on why you’re making a record.”)

Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sade’s videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.

“She said, ‘I don’t mind. I’ll do that for you, but I don’t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,’” Mr. Watson said. “I said, ‘The shoot is for you. You control all the images.’ Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.” Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.

A year later, Sade declined to release a house remix of “Pearls,” perhaps because there was something a little unseemly about people dancing to a song about the Somalian civil war. Then, a bootleg of it began making the rounds to D.J.s such as Junior Vasquez and Frankie Knuckles, who turned it into one of the era’s defining club tracks.

In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended. Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship. For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.

An eight-year stretch between albums yielded “Lover’s Rock,” which had lots about romance but also brought a quiet force to songs about issues facing black people. The video for “King of Sorrow” was a masterstroke of Sade-ness, where she wore ball gowns and a bandanna, scrubbing a child’s shoe clean. Was it a cautionary tale for single parenthood or a fashion spread devoted to it? Who could say. It was lovely.

By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts. With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.

All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew. The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade. The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.

Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.

One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious. Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form. (And the time away only helped build interest. The first tour for her 2001 album, “Lover’s Rock,” grossed $26 million. The second, for “Soldier of Love,” grossed $50 million.)

In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance. She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.

When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.

Ms. Adu can also sometimes be spotted on her cat-loving child’s Instagram. On Mother’s Day this year, this undated portrait was published. Back in January, on the day she turned 58, a recent picture appeared. She looks impeccably happy.

A post shared by Izaak Theo (@caracalonbenzos) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:21am PST

Even with so little of her, you can see her look everywhere. Just last week, T:, The New York Times Style Magazine put Nicki Minaj on a cover, her hair in a black ponytail, a pair of gold hoops dangling.

Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazine’s entertainment director, didn’t hesitate when asked whom they were channeling. “Sade,” she said. “You never know how someone’s going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres. Nicki saw the images and was like, ‘Sade, Oh my God. I love it.’ It felt expensive, cool and timeless.”

There’s talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isn’t sure.

“It’s always like that with Sade,” he said. “Time will go by and she’ll start working on it. For her, it’s like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning. You know you don’t want to do it, but at some point you just do it.”

“When we were having our first success with her, I said, ‘This lady could have a hit album when she’s 90 years old.’ Most artists try too hard,” Mr. Beck said. “And consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isn’t out there waving their résumé at you every five minutes. She’s completely unique.”",Sade’s Quiet Storm of Cool,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/style/sade-sade-sade.html

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

But that last sentence in the instructions bothered me: “When the puzzle is done, six familiar 15-letter phrases will read through the openings across and down.” What could that mean?

On my last night on the job, I drank on the line, like most everyone else. Everything from there is unclear, because — from what I was able to gather — one of the cooks had drugged my drink. Apparently, a crew of colleagues, all but one of them men, took me to a house to “party” after work. I’ve been told that the man who drugged me tried to take me home with him, but the other woman who’d come along prevented this. I got into a bed, and some other guy decided to do what he liked with me.

I do not remember this. I reported the assault to the police, but could never bring myself to ask for specifics. The handprint-shaped bruise I had on my thigh gave me enough to think about.

For a long time, I couldn’t believe I had been so stupid. How could I have missed that I was in a dangerous place?

Here’s how: I bought into the idea that talk in the kitchen was just talk, and that a thick skin would indeed protect me. But it wasn’t and it didn’t, because a sexualized workplace is a dangerous workplace for women. When the entire culture of a place is lewd, it makes it impossible to tell which men are dangerous. The raunchiest man in the kitchen had no part in the assault, but a quieter cook apparently did. In the din of dirty kitchen-speak, I could not have told you the difference between them.

The urgency of this problem was harder to see a generation ago, when kitchens were relatively marginal workplaces. That is no longer the case. Today restaurants are central to our culture and our economy. As the cult of celebrity chefs has grown, annual restaurant sales have more than doubled since 2001 to just under $800 billion. The National Restaurant Association says its industry employs nearly one-tenth of all workers. Last year, restaurant jobs exceeded 9.1 million, more than half held by women. This makes restaurants mainstream, professional workplaces, and that is true for both a social media manager for the Besh restaurants, or a teenage server at an IHOP.

Whatever degree of glamour in a particular job, harassment in restaurants is nearly universal. Two-thirds of female restaurant workers reported experiencing sexual harassment from management in a 2014 survey, and 80 percent reported it from co-workers, according to research from advocacy group Restaurant Opportunities Center United. The most common type reported was the kind of sexual teasing and jokes that had preceded my assault. Most women responded the same way I did: They ignored it.

Women ignore such behavior out of self-preservation, but men ignore it because it is easy and acceptable to do so. It sounds as if that was the strategy for Mr. Bourdain, who gave an interview to Slate last week. Around bro culture, he said, “I was so uncomfortable.” But when it came to being the bad boy, he also “played that role and went along with it.” So have most male chefs and food writers.

Ultimately, the plan would be likely to hurt the finances of the vast majority of Americans. No wonder it is starting to look politically vulnerable. Last week, a precursor bill barely passed the House, receiving 20 no votes from Republicans, many worried about the tax increases.

Republican leaders certainly have a path to passing a tax bill, because nothing unites modern Republicans the way a tax cut does. But the opposition to the recent health care bills also started as an underdog and managed to prevail, by relentlessly talking about the bills’ effects. When enough Americans understood the truth, enough members of Congress felt pressure to vote no.

The same could happen on taxes. It is already starting to. Recent polls suggest the plan’s approval rating is only about 30 percent.

To understand the Trump tax increases, you should first acknowledge the most admirable feature of his plan. It doesn’t aspire to be merely a tax cut. It aspires to be tax reform — both cuts and increases. Some deductions shrink, while rates fall, in the name of simplifying the tax code.

But after this promising start, the plan commits its cardinal sin. It places the highest priority on huge tax cuts for the very wealthy. They get lower rates and get to keep cherished tax breaks, like the “carried interest” loophole. Herbert Hoover’s Republican Party wanted to put a chicken in every pot. Donald Trump’s wants to put a yacht at every private dock.

Having lavished so much money on the wealthy, the tax package — or at least the vague framework that the administration has released — doesn’t have much remaining to spend on middle class and poor families. For them, the package is a mix of pluses and minuses. Many face a lower tax rate, but some face a higher one, and many families lose deductions.

The combination creates a lot of losers. Reduced deductions for children, for example, hurt large families, notes N.Y.U.’s Lily Batchelder. And the deduction for state and local taxes — also a target for cuts — now benefits 30 percent of households nationwide. It was the main reason for last week’s House defections, and the tensions over it haven’t been resolved.

Then there are the long-term problems I mentioned earlier. First, Trump’s plan takes a skimpy approach to inflation adjustments, which will push many families into higher tax brackets over time. Second, the plan would radically increase the federal deficit, and when it comes to the deficit, what goes up must eventually come down. At some point, the government will need to pay its bills, through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.

Virtually any future deficit-reduction plan — except for a repeal of the Trump tax plan — would hurt most families more than his plan helps them. This chain of events has happened before. The Reagan and George W. Bush tax cuts may have at first seemed to help the middle class and poor. But the deficits led to later cuts in education, medical research, transportation and anti-poverty programs that almost surely erased the benefits of a modest tax cut. Already, today’s congressional leaders are talking about sizable cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.

Trump and his allies are feverishly trying to claim their plan really would benefit the middle class. Their latest talking point is the notion that corporate tax cuts will create an indirect windfall for workers. Funny, though, how the wealthy get most of the direct benefits, while everyone else has to hope for indirect ones somehow to materialize.

Wounded Knee was the scene of the last major conflict of the American Indian Wars, in which 350 Lakota men, women and children were massacred by United States troops in 1890.

While his protests won some government concessions and drew national attention and wide sympathy for the deplorable social and economic conditions of American Indians, Mr. Banks achieved few real improvements in the daily lives of millions of Native Americans, who live on reservations and in major cities and lag behind most fellow citizens in jobs, housing and education.

To admirers, Mr. Banks was a broad-chested champion of native pride. With dark, piercing eyes, high cheekbones, a jutting chin and long raven hair, he was a paladin who defied authority and, in an era crowded with civil rights protests, spoke for the nation’s oldest minority.

To his critics, including many American Indians, Mr. Banks was a self-promoter, grabbing headlines and becoming a darling of politically liberal Hollywood stars like Jane Fonda and Marlon Brando. His severest detractors, including law-enforcement officials, said he let followers risk injury and arrest while he jumped bail to avoid a long prison sentence and did not surrender for nearly a decade.

Mr. Banks and Mr. Means first won national attention for declaring a “Day of Mourning” for Native Americans on Thanksgiving Day in 1970. Their band seized the ship Mayflower II, a replica of the original in Plymouth, Mass., and a televised confrontation between real Indians and costumed “Pilgrims” made the American Indian Movement leaders overnight heroes.

In 1972, the two organized cross-country car caravans on “Trails of Broken Treaties.” They converged on Washington with 500 followers to protest Indian living standards and lost treaty rights, occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs and held out for nearly a week, destroying documents and the premises, until the government agreed to discuss Indian grievances and review treaty commitments.

In 1973, after a white man killed an Indian in a saloon brawl and was charged not with murder but with involuntary manslaughter, Mr. Banks led 200 American Indian Movement protesters in a face-off with the police in Custer, S.D. It became a riot when the slain man’s mother was beaten by officers. After he left town, Mr. Banks, who said he had merely tried to ease tensions, was charged with assault and rioting.

It was the last straw. “We had reached a point in history where we could not tolerate the abuse any longer, where mothers could not tolerate the mistreatment that goes on on the reservations any longer, where they could not see another Indian youngster die,” he told the author Peter Matthiessen.

Weeks later, the siege that made Mr. Banks and Mr. Means famous across America began when 200 Oglala Lakota and A.I.M. followers with rifles and shotguns occupied Wounded Knee. About 300 United States marshals, F.B.I. agents and other law-enforcement officials cordoned off the area with armored cars and heavy weapons, touching off a 10-week battle of nerves and gunfire.

Amid wide news media coverage, the significance of the battlefield was not lost on many Americans. Dee Brown’s best-selling book “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West” (1970) had recently explored the record of massacres and atrocities against Native Americans on the expanding frontier, undermining one of the nation’s fondest myths.

Proclaiming a willingness to die for their cause, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means demanded the ouster of Richard Wilson, the elected leader of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, whom they called a corrupt white man’s stooge. The government refused. Shootings punctuated the days of stalemate, leaving wounded on both sides. Two Indians were killed, and a federal agent was shot and paralyzed.

When it was over, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means were charged with assault and conspiracy. After a federal trial, with the defense raising historic and current Indian grievances, a judge dismissed the case for prosecutorial misconduct, including illegal wiretaps and evidence that had been tampered with.

By then, Mr. Banks was a pre-eminent spokesman for Native Americans. He mediated armed conflicts between Indians and the authorities in various states. But his own legal troubles were not over.

Charged with riot and assault with a deadly weapon for his role in the 1973 melee in Custer, he was found guilty in 1975. Facing up to 15 years in prison, he jumped bail and fled to California.

With 1.4 million signatures on a petition supporting Mr. Banks, Gov. Jerry Brown granted him asylum in 1976, rejecting extradition to South Dakota by saying his life might be in danger if he were sent back. Mr. Banks later became chancellor of Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University, a small two-year college for Indians in Davis, Calif.

Deprived of California sanctuary when Governor Brown was succeeded by a Republican, George Deukmejian, in early 1983, Mr. Banks found a new refuge on an Onondaga reservation near Syracuse. Federal officials said he would be arrested only if he left the reservation. But in 1984, weary of his confined life, he returned to South Dakota voluntarily and was sentenced to three years in prison.

Paroled in 1985 after serving only 14 months, he moved to the Pine Ridge Reservation to work as a drug addiction and alcoholism counselor. He also turned his life around, embracing sobriety, giving talks on public service and organizing cross-country events that he called Sacred Runs, which became popular among supporters of Native Americans in later years.

“We were the prophets, the messengers, the fire starters,” Mr. Banks said in an autobiography, “Ojibwa Warrior: Dennis Banks and the Rise of the American Indian Movement” (2005, with Richard Erdoes). “Wounded Knee awakened not only the conscience of all Native Americans, but also of white Americans nationwide.”

Dennis James Banks was born on the Leech Lake Reservation on April 12, 1937. He never knew his father. His mother abandoned him to his grandparents.

When he was 5, he was taken from his family and sent to a series of government schools for Indians that systematically denigrated his Ojibwa (Chippewa) culture, language and identity. He ran away often, until, at 17, he returned to Leech Lake.

Unable to find work, he joined the Air Force and was stationed in Japan, where he married a Japanese woman, had a child with her and went absent without leave. Arrested and returned to the United States, he never saw his wife or child again. After being discharged, he moved to Minneapolis, drifted into crime, was arrested in a burglary and went to jail for two and a half years.

Released in 1968, he founded the American Indian Movement with an Ojibwa he had met in prison, Clyde Bellecourt, and others to fight the oppression and endemic poverty of Native Americans. He became chairman and national director as the group, based in Minneapolis, forged alliances and grew rapidly. After two years it said it had 25,000 members.

Within a year A.I.M., with its flair for guerrilla tactics, joined a lengthy occupation of Alcatraz Island, the former federal prison site in San Francisco Bay.

After his fugitive years, Mr. Banks had a modest movie career. He had roles in Franc Roddam’s “War Party” (1988), Michael Apted’s “Thunderheart” (1992), Michael Mann’s “The Last of the Mohicans” (1992, with Russell Means), and Georgina Lightning’s “Older Than America” (2008), which explored the devastating effects of Indian boarding schools like those Mr. Banks had been forced to attend.

Mr. Banks also appeared in documentaries: “We Shall Remain, Part V: Wounded Knee” (2009), a Ric Burns “American Experience” television film directed by Stanley Nelson; “A Good Day to Die” (2010), directed by David Mueller and Lynn Salt; and “Nowa Cumig: The Drum Will Never Stop” (2011), directed by Marie-Michele Jasmin-Belisle.

Besides his wife and child in Japan, Mr. Banks had many children with other women. In addition to Ms. Banks Rama, he is survived by 19 children, 11 with the surname Banks: Janice, Darla, Deanna, Dennis, Red Elk, Tatanka, Minoh, Tokala, Tiopa, Tacanunpa and Arrow. The others are Glenda Roberts, Beverly Baribeau, Kevin Strong, D. J. Nelson-Banks, Bryan Graves, and Pearl, Denise and Kawlija Blanchard. Mr. Banks is also survived by more than 100 grandchildren, Ms. Banks Rama said.

Mr. Banks was the 2016 vice presidential nominee of the California Peace and Freedom Party, which identified itself as socialist and feminist. The party’s presidential candidate was Gloria La Riva. As a single-state ticket, they won 66,000 votes.

In recent years, Mr. Banks lived with some of his children in Kentucky and Minnesota. He was an honorary trustee of the Leech Lake Tribal College, a two-year public institution in Cass Lake, Minn. Mr. Means, who also appeared in movies and wrote a memoir, died on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 2012 at age 72.

In 1990, both men joined a ceremony at the Pine Ridge Reservation commemorating the centenary of the Wounded Knee massacre.

“Maybe we opened up some eyes, opened some doors,” Mr. Banks told The Los Angeles Times. “And it was at least an educational process here.

But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,” said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. “But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.”

That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing.

“I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,” Mr. Tucker said. “But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.”

If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

The classical pianist Emanuel Ax, whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear.

“I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,” Mr. Ax said. “Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.”

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

DeSe Escobar

Age: 28

Hometown: Pasadena, Calif.

Now Lives: In a small two-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side, with a shower in the kitchen.

Claim to Fame: A multihyphenate artist and social ringleader, Ms. Escobar is the latest in a glamorous line of Warhol-like ambassadors to downtown New York’s nexus of art and night life. Her subversive practice includes retouching Alexander Hamilton’s face on a $10 bill and found-object pieces like “used makeup wipes from nights spent with a former lover,” she said. She is also a D.J. and host of Glam, a monthly party at China Chalet on lower Broadway. “Even though it’s a mixed crowd, we are queer people doing a queer party,” said Ms. Escobar, who is transgender. “Glam is a safe space for sisters to come together.”

Big Break: Although she moved to New York in 2010 to pursue fashion, she soon soured on the industry and “started dabbling in night life a little bit to pay my rent.” Recent gigs include fashion week parties for Diane von Furstenberg and the makeup artist Pat McGrath, and the opening party for the Whitney Biennial. Her late-night credentials have boosted her art-world profile. She was part of a group video show at the Artists Space gallery last year, and starred in a surrealist food-styling cooking show for Dis Magazine.

Latest Project: Nike enlisted Ms. Escobar’s image-making skills for a limited-edition art book about basketball jerseys to be published next year. “I am thankful for trans people having media exposure, but I wish there was more,” she said. “So in that way, I am grateful for the visibility and to work with brands that don’t normally work with trans artists.”",An Artist and Hostess Who Calls Herself an Alt-Kardashian,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/style/dese-escobar-art-glam-party.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The number of such journals has exploded to more than 10,000 in recent years, with nearly as many predatory as legitimate ones. “Predatory publishing is becoming an organized industry,” wrote one group of critics in a paper in Nature.

Many of these journals have names that closely resemble those of established publications, making them easily mistakable. There is the Journal of Economics and Finance, published by Springer, but now also the Journal of Finance and Economics. There is the Journal of Engineering Technology, put out by the American Society for Engineering Education, but now another called the GSTF Journal of Engineering Technology.

Predatory journals have few expenses, since they do not seriously review papers that are submitted and they publish only online. They blast emails to academics, inviting them to publish. And the journals often advertise on their websites that they are indexed by Google Scholar. Often that is correct — but Google Scholar does not vet the journals it indexes.

The journals are giving rise to a wider ecosystem of pseudo science. For the academic who wants to add credentials to a resume, for instance, publishers also hold meetings where, for a hefty fee, you can be listed as a presenter — whether you actually attend the meeting or not.

One of those meetings, held in New York in June by a group called the World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, seemed more like a Potemkin village. On the publisher’s website, the convention promised to be large and lavish.

But when I visited, the only venue was a small windowless room on the sixth floor of a hotel undergoing renovation. A handful of people sat in the room, diligently listening to a talk. Most who were listed on the program were not in attendance.

Participating in such dubious enterprises carries few risks. Dr. Pyne, who did a study of his colleagues publications, reports that faculty members at his school who got promoted last year had at least four papers in questionable journals. All but one academic in 10 who won a School of Business and Economics award had published papers in these journals. One had 10 such articles.

Academics get rewarded with promotions when they stuff their resumes with articles like these, Dr. Pyne concluded. There are few or no adverse consequences — in fact, the rewards for publishing in predatory journals were greater than for publishing in legitimate ones.

Dr. Pyne does not know if what role those studies played in the promotions. But, he said, “I can say that such publications do not seem to hurt promotion prospects.”

Tensions over this kind of scholarship have spilled over Queensborough Community College, part of CUNY, the City University of New York.

Although it is hardly known for its research, college administrators urge the faculty to publish. Recently group of concerned professors complained that nearly a dozen colleagues have repeatedly published in at least one of the dubious journals — and have been promoted and rewarded for it.

Noting that a number of these papers apparently depended on federal and city funds, the professors brought the matter to the attention of the vice chancellor for research and even wrote to the New York State inspector general’s office.

The school referred inquiries to its head librarian, Jeanne Galvin.

“Just as with many colleges, faculty submit their work for publication in a variety of journals based on individual judgment,” she said in an email. “Queensborough offers several advisory resources, such as workshops and individual consultation with expert librarians. The research that I have seen published by our faculty is of the highest quality.”

Some say the academic system bears much of the blame for the rise of predatory journals, demanding publications even from teachers at places without real resources for research and where they may have little time apart from teaching.

At Queensborough, faculty members typically teach nine courses per year. At four-year colleges, faculty may teach four to six courses a year.

Yet “every university requires some level of publication,” said Lawrence DiPaolo, vice president of academic affairs at Neumann University in Aston, Pa.

Recently a group of researchers who invented a fake academic: Anna O. Szust. The name in Polish means fraudster. Dr. Szust applied to legitimate and predatory journals asking to be an editor. She supplied a résumé in which her publications and degrees were total fabrications, as were the names of the publishers of the books she said she had contributed to.

The legitimate journals rejected her application immediately. But 48 out of 360 questionable journals made her an editor. Four made her editor in chief. One journal sent her an email saying, “It’s our pleasure to add your name as our editor in chief for the journal with no responsibilities.”

The lead author of the Dr. Fraud sting operation, Katarzyna Pisanski, a psychologist at the University of Sussex in England, said the question of what motivates people to publish in such journals “is a touchy subject.”

“If you were tricked by spam email you might not want to admit it, and if you did it wittingly to increase your publication counts you might also not want to admit it,” she said in an email.

The consequences of participating can be more than just a résumé freckled with poor-quality papers and meeting abstracts. Publications become part of the body of scientific literature.

There are indications that some academic institutions are beginning to wise up to the dangers.

Dewayne Fox, an associate professor of fisheries at Delaware State University, sits on a committee at his school that reviews job applicants. One recent applicant, he recalled, listed 50 publications in such journals and is on the editorial boards of some of them.

A few years ago, he said, no one would have noticed. But now he and others on search committees at his university have begun scrutinizing the publications closely to see if the journals are legitimate.

“If something gets published in one of these journals and it’s complete garbage, it can develop a life of its own,” Dr. Fox said.

“We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small,” Dr. Seib said.
So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty?","Along with other frailty measures, that meant that “surgery is not going to go very well,” Dr. Robinson said. In a frank half-hour conversation, he explained to his patient that he faced a 30 to 40 percent risk of dying from the surgery. If he survived, he probably would endure a long, difficult recovery and might not regain the functional abilities he had now.

Dilemmas like these will grow more common as the population ages. Already, more than a third of inpatient surgical procedures are performed on patients over age 65.

But about 15 percent of the older population, excluding nursing home residents, meets the criteria for frailty, rising to more than a third of those over age 85. “There’s a much higher prevalence in the Deep South and among African Americans,” said Dr. Jeremy Walston, principal investigator at the Older Americans Independence Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

Geriatricians like Dr. Walston have been publishing research on frailty for nearly 20 years, as measured by tools developed at Johns Hopkins or by a Canadian group, and variants thereof. The Hopkins approach uses tests like grip strength and walking speed; the Canadian index relies on health deficits, including chronic illnesses and dementia.

Both assessments do a good job of identifying patients vulnerable to health problems, regardless of chronological age. A British group has used meta-analyses, for instance, to show that frail older adults are more prone to falls, fractures, hospitalizations, dementia and nursing home placement.

In the United States, though, “it’s the surgeons who have picked up the banner,” Dr. Walston said. They’re starting to use frailty to help make decisions about which procedures make sense for which older patients.

You can see why: Frailty involves decreased physiological reserve, which helps determine how patients respond to physical stress.

Surgery brings plenty of that, said Dr. Carolyn Seib, a general and endocrine surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco. The effects of anesthesia and inflammation, the risk of blood clots or infection, muscle weakness caused by days in bed — all can take a toll.

“The more frail a patient is, the higher the risk of complications,” Dr. Seib said.

Researchers have shown that after major operations — including cardiac and colon cancer surgery and kidney transplants — frail older patients are more prone than others to longer hospital stays, being readmitted within a month of a procedure and winding up in nursing homes after they’re discharged.

They’re also more likely to die.

But a study that Dr. Seib and her colleagues published in JAMA Surgery this month shows that frail seniors face higher complications even after ambulatory surgery, outpatient procedures often considered routine.

Hernia repairs, thyroid or parathyroid surgery, operations for breast cancer — “patients and providers often don’t think twice about these,” Dr. Seib said.

Yet when the researchers looked at 141,000 patients over age 40 in a national surgical database, they found that serious complications were two to four times higher in patients with moderate to high frailty, although complication rates overall were low (1.7 percent, with .7 percent experiencing serious complications).

“We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small,” Dr. Seib said. Although surgeons increasingly screen for frailty, “I wouldn’t say it’s routine yet,” she added.

So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty? Should we do an assessment that indicates how frail she might be?

Unlike some conditions, frailty is something patients and doctors can actually do something about. “There are interventions that can improve or even resolve it,” said Dr. Linda Fried, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and a pioneer in frailty research.

First, many surgical centers offer a “prehabilitation” program, shown to improve patients’ results through exercise, better nutrition and smoking cessation. Undertaken even for a few weeks before an operation, “it improves your bounce-back capability,” Dr. Fried said.

Physical activity, in particular, “seems to be the key to preventing frailty and its progression,” Dr. Fried added — even for those not contemplating surgery.

Second, surgical decision-making is not a binary choice between patients agreeing to the standard operation or doing nothing. Alerted to frailty, a surgeon might opt for a less aggressive approach or a different kind of anesthesia. A patient, understanding that she may be looking at an altered future even if the surgery fixes the physical problem, will have her own priorities to weigh.

With frailty, “I’m going to counsel the patient differently,” Dr. Robinson said. “Maybe change the surgery I do. Maybe find an alternative. There’s a spectrum of possibilities.”

Take his patient with gallstone disease.

After their discussion, the man decided that instead of undergoing what would be, for him, a high-risk operation, he would go home and try to avoid foods that triggered his symptoms. If the pain flared again, Dr. Robinson would insert a tube through his skin to drain the gallbladder, a much safer procedure.

Because the tube, and the bag into which it drained, would be permanent, it might not represent a welcome alternative for a healthier patient. But “for a physiologically vulnerable older adult,” Dr. Robinson said, “it’s a whole different equation.”",One Last Question Before the Operation: Just How Frail Are You?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/health/elderly-surgery-frailty.html

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

Other new one-star restaurants are the newly relocated Rouge Tomate Chelsea; Cote, the Korean steakhouse in the Flatirion district from Simon Kim, whose Piora in the West Village had a star but has been omitted from the guide because it is now closed; and the Clocktower, also in the Flatiron, with the English chef Jason Atherton, a partnership with Stephen Starr.

It’s the first Michelin award for Mr. Starr, the Philadelphia restaurateur who is increasingly a player in New York. But Le Coucou, the highly regarded jewel in his crown (with three stars from Pete Wells of The New York Times), where Daniel Rose is the chef, has yet to be starred by Michelin. “Le Coucou did not quite meet our criteria,” Mr. Ellis said, “But it’s doing very well.”

The guide did not cover the Grill and the Pool, the restaurants that have replaced the Four Seasons restaurant, because Michelin thought “they were not quite ready,” he said.

There were eight restaurants dropped from the one-star list, most because they have closed. Similarly, Soto, which closed, was omitted from the two-star list. Over the last month, Michelin has been releasing results for three other American cities: Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. The company delayed publication of the San Francisco guide by two weeks because of the wine country fires.

Of particular note are some of the San Francisco results. Coi, a seafood restaurant in San Francisco, was elevated to three stars, giving San Francisco a total of seven three-star restaurants, more than New York. The new SingleThread, in Healdsburg in Sonoma County, earned two stars, and Californios, a Mexican restaurant in San Francisco, was also awarded two stars, making it the first Mexican restaurant in the United States to be given that high a ranking.

There were no changes this year in the three-star lineups for Chicago or Washington. The New York City guide will be available starting Friday for $18.99.

Mr. Gates was forced out of that lobbying group in April amid questions about Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.

“As part of the scheme, Manafort and Gates repeatedly provided false information to financial bookkeepers, tax accountants and legal counsel, among others,” the indictment said.

Attempts to reach Mr. Gates on Monday were unsuccessful.

If convicted of money laundering, the most serious charge, Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort could face up to 20 years in prison.

Mr. Manafort had been under federal investigation on suspicion of violating tax law, laundering money and whether he appropriately disclosed his foreign lobbying work. As Mr. Manafort’s business associate, Mr. Gates’s name is listed on documents that are linked to companies Mr. Manafort’s firm established in Cyprus for payments from politicians and businesspeople in Eastern Europe, according to records reviewed by The New York Times.

When the business partners worked in Ukraine, Mr. Gates flew to Moscow for meetings with associates of a Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska.

Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort met years ago when Mr. Gates was interning at Mr. Manafort’s Washington consulting firm, Black, Manafort, Stone, Kelly. The firm was known for running Republican political campaigns and then lobbying the politicians after they won their elections.

In Washington, Mr. Manafort was known for representing dictators and strongmen, such as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines. Mr. Manafort also represented the Trump Organization to lobby the Treasury Department regarding casino transaction rules.

Mr. Gates would later follow Mr. Manafort to a new firm, Davis Manafort, which worked on the campaign of Viktor F. Yanukovych, the pro-Russia former Ukranian president. This work connected the men with Mr. Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Deripaska has been denied a visa to travel to the United States because of allegations that he is linked to organized crime operations, charges Mr. Deripaska has denied.

In 2008, Mr. Gates took over the firm’s duties in Eastern Europe, where he worked on business development and contract negotiations.

And this work could be lucrative. Mr. Manafort was a multimillionaire with vacation homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and the Hamptons.

In 2007, Mr. Gates and his wife sold their home in Richmond, Va., for $700,000 and took out a $1.5 million loan for a house in one of the city’s wealthier neighborhoods, according to public records.

That same year Davis Manafort embarked on a new venture — a private equity fund created to buy small companies in Russia and Eastern Europe. Mr. Deripaska was the biggest investor in the fund, called Pericles.

Mr. Gates has said he read news reports about Mr. Deripaska and his visa problems, but they did not raise concerns for him.

“We thought we had a good business model,” Mr. Gates has said. “We thought we were going to be successful.”

The fund floundered and the one deal with Mr. Deripaska turned into a legal dispute. The fund also raised red flags for investigators, particularly the transactions that flowed through offshore accounts in Cyprus.

According to handwritten ledgers found in a former office of Mr. Yanukovych’s political party, payments totaling $12.7 million were made to Mr. Manafort in undisclosed cash transactions between 2007 and 2012. Other documents suggest that one payment that was earmarked for Mr. Manafort was paid through an offshore bank account.

Mr. Manafort has said that the ledgers are forgeries and that he never received secret cash payments.

Davis Manafort used shell companies to process payments for its political and business activities. Mr. Gates was one of the employees who worked with the Cypriot law firm that registered these companies, according to documents reviewed by The Times.

Russian oligarchs and businesses have been using Cyprus as a tax haven for years. Mr. Gates has said he was told that the firm’s clients instructed Davis Manafort to use accounts in Cyprus for money transfers.

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said Mr. Gates used money from some of these offshore bank accounts to pay for his mortgage, the tuition for his children’s education and decorating his home.

According to public records, Mr. Gates lives in Richmond.

In early 2014, Mr. Yanukovych was ousted from power, sending Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to look for new political clients. The client search ultimately led them to the Republican presidential primary race in the United States.

Mr. Gates followed Mr. Manafort to the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016. Mr. Gates managed many of the campaign’s daily operations and often traveled with Mr. Trump and others working on the campaign.

After the election, Mr. Gates went on to help run Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee and later a lobbying group that raised money to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda.

But federal investigators remained interested in the work Mr. Gates did with Mr. Manafort.

Mr. Mueller said that the men made tens of millions of dollars as a result of their work in Ukraine and that they worked to hide the payments for about a decade.

The two men “laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts,” the indictment read.","Rick Gates, a Protégé of Paul Manafort, Is Indicted Alongside Him",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/rick-gates-russia.html

Trump have buoyed Blumhouse, his hit factory that has made “Get Out,” “Sinister,” “Insidious,” “The Purge,” “Paranormal Activity,” “Split,” “The Gift” and “The Visit.”

Blumhouse also produced the Oscar-winning “Whiplash” and won Emmys for “The Normal Heart” and “The Jinx,” the eerie six-part documentary about Robert Durst that ended with him caught on a hot microphone whispering to himself in a bathroom about his dead wife and dead best friend: “What the hell did I do? Killed them all of course.”

Mr. Blum is now teaming with John Carpenter for the final “Halloween” with Ms. Curtis returning as Laurie Strode.

In the time Mr. Blum and I were having dinner, his latest, “Happy Death Day,” a ghoulish twist on “Groundhog Day,” leapt to No. 1 at the weekend box office.

“I think when people are scared, they like to see movies where the scares are not real,” Mr. Blum says. “The current administration’s been terrific for the scary-movie business. It’s been our best year ever. I think ‘Get Out’ did four times the business it would have done if Hillary had been president.”

Mr. Blum frets about the White House swallowing his former communications chief, Josh Raffel, who left him to become Jared Kushner’s lieutenant, much like the hero of “Get Out” is swallowed by “the sunken place.” He jokes that he wants to rescue Mr. Raffel from the “cult” because “I’m scared Jared is drinking his blood.”

Christopher Landon, the director of “Happy Death Day,” agrees that President Trump “has stirred up all these dark places and dark corners and old shadows of our culture, and horror is so well suited to address these things.”

While Hollywood is in atrophy, endlessly and tediously replicating comic-book franchises, Mr. Blum is able to be original and risky by staying fast and cheap. And once he got successful, he did not jump to blockbusters.

“He has created a business model that works, making films for $5 million or less with clear commerciality and marketability,” says Donna Langley, chairwoman of Universal Pictures, who signed Mr. Blum to a 10-year, first-look film deal. “He’s excitable and exciting to be around.”

Ethan Hawke, an old Blum friend who starred in “Sinister,” says that when you think of a horror impresario you think of a “dour, terrifying person,” but “the big surprise about being Jason’s friend is how much joy he has.”

In a fear-based business, Mr. Blum sprinkles pixie dust, making filmmakers’ dreams come true — on a budget. Mr. Landon calls Mr. Blum “a cross between Willy Wonka and Robert Evans. He has this sort of mad-professor vibe but an old-school charm as well, an energy fluttering about him that is hard to contain.”

Dressed in khaki pants and a blue vest from Zara and wearing a 1987 Rolex, Mr. Blum pulls out his phone to show me some of his old Halloween costumes where he is dressed as a female character.

“My mother always said I should have been born a woman,” he says, laughing. “I have good legs.”

Last year, he was a convincing Wicked Witch of the West and his wife, Lauren Schuker, was Dorothy. Ms. Schuker is a former Wall Street Journal reporter who is co-writing a movie about Gamergate for Amy Pascal’s production company. They have a 2-year-old daughter.

This year, Mr. Blum was Ivanka, in her famous pink sheath dress, and Ms. Schuker was Iraq Jared in his flak jacket. They accessorized with buttons reading: “America’s Scariest Couple.”

Mr. Blum loves to troll Ivanka and her “daddy.” When Ivanka tweeted a FEMA update about the California wildfires, Mr. Blum retweeted her, noting dryly: “It’s fun to play government.” When she tweeted on empowering and investing in women, Mr. Blum retweeted with this acidic comment: “But don’t give them birth control. You are a gross opportunist.”

I ask him about the PC crackdown on costumes. Universities now issue guidelines and hold “social justice” workshops about how to avoid “cultural appropriation.”

A list of instructions circulating on Twitter read: “How to Not Be a Jerk This Halloween: No problematic historical figures; Don’t glorify violence against women; Cultures are not costumes (absolutely no blackface, brownface, yellowface; absolutely no religious garb (i.e. hijabs, bindis, etc.); absolutely no native headdresses; absolutely no gypsy-related costumes); Gender identity is not a costume (don’t dress trans if you’re not trans); Sexual identity is not a costume (don’t dress as a gay figure if you’re not gay.)”

Mr. Blum observes simply: “Halloween is woke, and there’s nothing we can do about it.”

Over a mango lassi at the Bombay Club, he explains how he drove his customized van that doubles as an office down the road to inheriting the mantle of Val Lewton and Roger Corman as a master of shadows.

“My favorite thing about horror is that it attracts this great group of nuts, of which I include myself in,” Mr. Blum says. “I was always kind of an oddball. I collected my fingernails, for instance.

“Halloween was definitely the biggest holiday when I was a kid. We started making our Halloween costumes in August. Me and my mom. My mom was a single mom, it was just her and I.”

He grew up in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. He was 4 years old when his parents got divorced. His mother, Shirley, was an art history professor at SUNY Purchase, and his father was Irving Blum, an art dealer in Los Angeles who was the first to show Warhol’s soup cans.

At Vassar College, Mr. Blum took a course on Hitchcock, which hooked him. His roommate was the future director Noah Baumbach.

“We were best friends,” Mr. Blum says. “When I graduated college, I moved to Chicago and I was roommates with Noah. We lived in this little one-bedroom apartment. I sold cable TV door to door. Noah wrote ‘Kicking and Screaming,’ and we decided together we were going to get that movie made.”

They moved to New York and Mr. Blum got his real-estate license. His father gave the script to one of his clients, Steve Martin, who let the would-be filmmakers use his letter praising it to shop it around. But after Mr. Blum helped get the movie up and running, he says, his friend cut him out. “Noah got what he needed from me and moved on,” he says.

I ask about his five-year stint from 1995 to 2000 working for Harvey Weinstein in Mr. Weinstein’s film acquisition unit.

Looking pained, Mr. Blum says he is “reprogramming” Mr. Weinstein to a different place in his brain and that he knew his boss was dark, just not that dark.

“Before all this, we heard the story, ‘Oh, he was in his hotel room, he was with an actress. He touched her on the leg or did something he shouldn’t have done. He’s a bully. She left. She threatened to sue him and rather than go through litigation, he gave her 100,000 bucks.’ And the settlements were described as ‘People are taking advantage of me because I’m rich.’

“That’s what we all thought, like, ‘Yeah, he’s gross, Harvey’s being a scumbag again’ — not, ‘He was a rapist.’ I was in his hotel room when he was in his robe. He was in his robe all the time when we were traveling at film festivals. He worked 24 hours a day and he was always in his robe.”

When Mr. Blum lost the distribution rights to “Run Lola Run” in a Toronto negotiation, after Mr. Weinstein changed the terms at the last minute, Mr. Weinstein ordered Mr. Blum to run over to the hotel of the rights holders and stay there until they changed their minds.

“I’m 28 years old,” Mr. Blum recalls. “I’m bawling. It’s 3:30 a.m. I’m knocking on the guy’s door, begging him to open the door. And crying. I’m crying, I’m crying. He won’t open the door.” Mr. Weinstein rushed up to Toronto and they went into one of the multiple hotel suites his boss always kept — “there were always endless hotel rooms,” Mr. Blum says — and Mr. Weinstein threw his lit cigarette.

“And the lit cigarette hit me,” Mr. Blum continues. “It bounced off me and bounced on the floor and Harvey knew he shouldn’t have done it and he said, ‘I was going for the garbage can.’ And I was so upset at the other side, and attracted to being abused, that I was fully on Harvey’s side. I was like, ‘Harvey, don’t worry about it. I’m so mad, too. I can’t believe what they did to us.’

“Oh my God, it was total Stockholm syndrome. He bullied me, he threw a lit cigarette at me. And I tried to hide that it happened, trying to protect him. I mean, it was very, very abusive. When he called, you would go into a sweat. Every time he called, I was terrified. And wherever I was, from the time I was under that contract, I was never free. I went into cognitive therapy after I was there 12 months, because I had depression.”

The therapist gave him a self-help book called “The Assertive Option,” which he began using in interactions with the Weinstein brothers, who “were so brutal that everyone else banded together and protected each other against these guys. They weren’t Cain and Abel, because they were both awful. But they also hated each other.”

He said he is struggling “to figure out why I chose to stay in a place for years where I was abused. He didn’t force me to stay there. I could have quit at any time. Why didn’t I quit?”

He agreed with a former colleague at the company who told him recently: “I wish I could go to the hospital and get the part where Harvey existed in my brain taken out of my brain.”

He did learn a lot from Mr. Weinstein, he says, including the frenetic pace and the never-give-up attitude. But in other ways, he has modeled his company to be the reverse of that one. He never micromanages. “Harvey would spend days arguing over a part that was three days long,” Mr. Blum says. “I don’t know who plays those parts. It’s such a waste of time. We give a ton of creative input, but I don’t spend 700 years arguing over something like Nicole Kidman’s nose in ‘The Hours.’

“Harvey would say ‘I’m the best editor in Hollywood.’ He didn’t look at his job as supporting the artists. He looked at himself as an artist. And I look at myself as a curator, blowing a path through to let the artist do their thing. I would be terrible at directing a movie. I don’t have that kind of brain.”

Because of his parents, Mr. Blum understands how to talk to artists, but he also gets the needs of the business side.

He has always made it a practice not to meet with actresses alone. “I just don’t want to be in my office alone with an actress. It might be because of Harvey, because I’m terrified the actress will walk out of the door and say I did something wrong. So there’s no way they can do that if there’s someone else in the room.”

He’s the Mike Pence of Hollywood, I suggest.

“It’s the power dynamic,” he says. “You get a 23-year-old actress sitting in your office, I think they feel like, do they flirt in the meeting, do they not flirt? It’s just uncomfortable. It just lingers in the air. And I don’t want it lingering in the air. And if my head of casting, who is a woman, is sitting there, it’s fine. And I can ask for an actress’s email and it’s not weird. Then I send them a script directly, I don’t go through their agent, and it’s fine.”

Before the Weinstein revelations, Mr. Blum had bought Gabriel Sherman’s book on Roger Ailes to turn into a eight-part series for Showtime, the saga of “the guy who enabled the guy,” the Fox News chief who rolled out the red carpet to the Trump White House.

Mr. Blum says the movie he would most like to do now is a remake of the 1957 Andy Griffith classic, “A Face in the Crowd,” about a wealthy, megalomaniacal television personality who swans about as the voice of the people until he’s exposed as a phony.

Nasty withdrawal symptoms make stopping doubly hard. She spent four and a half months in a New Jersey rehabilitation center before joining the Haven, first as a resident, now as a frequent visitor. She has been clean for a year and a half.

The opioid epidemic has ravaged communities around the nation — deaths from overdoses now outnumber deaths from car crashes — prompting President Trump to establish a federal task force and, on Thursday, to declare a public health emergency, allowing some grant money to be released to combat the problem and some laws and regulations to be eased. The task force is to issue a plan of action this week.

Already on campuses, recovery programs are expanding and multiplying, populated by students who have struggled with dependence on Percocet (oxycodone) and Vicodin (hydrocodone), as well as those who have moved on to fentanyl and heroin, which are far cheaper on the street than prescription pills.

Little data exist on the extent of the problem among college students. But according to a 2016 national survey of them by the University of Michigan, 7 percent of 870 respondents said they had misused opioid painkillers; 4 percent had done so in the previous year. For 19- to 22-year-olds who hadn’t gone to college or had dropped out, which is common when struggling with addiction, close to 13 percent said they had misused painkillers.

Sean Esteban McCabe, a Michigan researcher who has studied student addiction for close to 20 years, said misuse is most prevalent on competitive campuses, where students are more affluent and have better access to prescribed pills. Studies have indicated that athletes in high-contact sports like ice hockey and wrestling, who are often prescribed painkillers, are particularly vulnerable. Campus users, Dr. McCabe said, tend to be white, live in fraternity or sorority houses, and have lower grade-point averages.

Thanks to better prevention education and treatment, heroin use among college students has flattened out, and abuse of painkillers seems to be dropping. A decade ago, 9 percent in the Michigan survey said they had misused within the previous year.

This news has not heartened advocates, though, largely because the number of deaths has actually risen. Public health officials blame a black market flooded with more dangerous options like fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic that is 100 times more potent than morphine. It is the opioid that killed Prince.

Opioid-related deaths among Americans age 24 and under almost doubled from 2005 to 2015, when 3,165 were reported, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of opioid-related emergency room visits by young people also nearly doubled over five years, from 52 per 100,000 patients to 97 in 2014, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

Last May, four students at Johns Hopkins University were hospitalized after overdosing on opioids during a late-night fraternity party. Furman University in Greenville, S.C., lost a student a day before his graduation last spring when he overdosed on fentanyl. A sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who had just spent the weekend with his mother at a Tar Heel football game, was found dead in his bedroom. In his system were traces of the opioids he had tried desperately to kick.

States have urged colleges to take action. New York and Colorado are earmarking millions of dollars to their public colleges for prevention education and research. Maryland now requires colleges and universities to offer arriving students a drug-prevention class that focuses on the risks of opioid use. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who heads the federal addiction task force, announced this year a $1 million increase for recovery dorms on public campuses in his state.

It is not uncommon for stores near campuses, health centers and dorms to stock free overdose reversal kits of naloxone. And the return to school now includes a bustle of overdose-prevention training sessions for residence hall assistants, campus police officers and health care workers.

Last year, West Virginia University, in a state that leads the nation in fatal drug overdoses, started a parent support group. Mothers and fathers of young users gather monthly, some calling in remotely, to tell stories of spoons going missing from kitchen cutlery drawers and students calling home, desperate for money, dropping out of classes or getting arrested. Sometimes the parents cry uncontrollably.

Prescription pills are part of the party mix. Xanax, a highly addictive anxiety drug, has become a popular accompaniment to beer and vodka shots. Adderall is crushed for snorting. And Vicodin is ingested as a relaxant, available from students with prescriptions or on an online black market.

Dr. Joseph Lee, medical director for youth services at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, says that students act as mixologists, creating dangerous drug and alcohol cocktails for themselves and friends. “They are alarmingly familiar with what they can do to get high, but not the danger,” he said, “and they don’t know where to get help.”

Students in recovery confirm this. Many of them say that in high school and college they were purposeful about their drug use, smoking pot to calm down and taking stimulants to speed up. The technique worked well, until overuse and mixed use began to alter the impact. Drugs that were supposed to do one thing did another.

Bart Arconti, a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, got hooked on prescription painkillers in the basement of his best friend’s townhouse in a Baltimore suburb. He was 17. His friend had bought hydrocodone from a neighbor. They crushed a pill on the washing machine lid and snorted it. It became his favorite high.

Mr. Arconti hopes his story might inspire others to get help. He stopped taking opioids four and a half years ago after several stints in rehabilitation. He says users destined to become addicts generally experiment until they find the drug they want. “There is a lot to choose from,” he said.

It should not be a surprise that today’s 20-somethings have developed a taste for prescription pill cocktails. Pills are ubiquitous in homes, schools and offices. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2015 found that 119 million Americans, 12 and older, take prescription painkillers, tranquilizers, sedatives or, increasingly among children and young adults, stimulants like Adderall. That’s nearly half the population.

Painkillers in particular have surged. The sale of opioids quadrupled between 1999 and 2010, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. By 2012, doctors were writing 259 million opioid prescriptions a year, enough for every American adult to have his or her own bottle. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has been encouraging doctors to reduce the number of addictive pills they hand out. Parents are being told to dispose of unused painkillers, and drug companies are producing opioids in gel forms, so they can’t be crushed to snort.

Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the co-director of Opioid Policy Research at Brandeis University’s Heller School for Social Policy and Management, describes the drug surge as “a pill-for-everything culture,” which he says has significantly affected how young people feel about prescription pills when they go off to college. Multiple studies have shown that the more available pills are to young people, the more likely they are to use them.

“Today, if you grow up in a home where pills are used for every little problem,” he said, “you are likely to leave for college with a lot less fear about them.”

Throughout October, a wall of painted sneakers has greeted visitors to the University of North Carolina’s student union. It’s part of an exhibit entitled “Step Into the Soles of Recovery,” sponsored by the university’s four-year-old recovery program. Alongside the shoes are the personal accounts of the students who decorated them. The laces of one sneaker are wrapped tightly around it. On a piece of paper nearby, the student wrote: “For me, addiction always felt suffocating.”

Frank Allison used heroin and drank heavily until he was 40; now 51, he heads the U.N.C. recovery program. He said the exhibit was a way for some of the four-dozen students in his program to talk candidly with the campus about their struggles, part of a push to destigmatize addiction and shift attitudes about treatment.

Mr. Allison wants to see a move away from a “moral model” that treats students with substance issues like failures with no self-control instead of like people with a chronic illness, which is how the American Society of Addiction Medicine defines it. Physicians believe that this viewpoint will help frame the opioid problem for parents and educators, and help funnel recovery and prevention funds onto campuses.

U.N.C. offers a cadre of services that largely depend on where students are in their recovery — six months substance-free or 60 months substance-free. Two years ago, Mr. Allison persuaded administrators to offer beds on a drug- and alcohol-free dorm floor. Three of his students currently live there. Some choose to be closely monitored, through breathalyzers and urine tests. The university helps them find therapists and coaches who accompany them to multiple recovery meetings a week. Others have chosen more autonomy but attend Mr. Allison’s workshops on meditation, mindfulness and balanced living.

Like others in the movement, he refers to addiction as a “substance use disorder” and refuses to use the word “failure” when referring to relapses.

“People don’t misuse substances because they are bad people,” he said. “I wasn’t a bad person. I was a sick person. Having a substance use disorder is like having diabetes or a heart condition.”

Mr. Arconti, now 26 and pursuing a degree in Asian studies, says that Mr. Allison’s vision is reflected in the recovery community. The group, mostly male, consists of former frat boys, rock climbers and hip-hop fans, many not yet of legal drinking age. While some arrived in the program after too much dorm-room pot smoking, Mr. Arconti’s addiction lasted years. At the height of it, he made frequent “runs” to a drug-infested neighborhood in West Baltimore. Some of his friends have since died. Others are in jail. That was before he woke up one morning in a seedy hotel room and decided his body was spent. He committed to stopping.

When there are U.N.C. basketball games Mr. Arconti watches with his recovery friends. Together, they go to Durham Bulls games and amusement parks. But it is at weekly meetings where the recovery ethos shines. Students talk about sober dating, relapse temptations and struggles to make time for studying and recovery. When they speak specifically about their addictions, they are quick to play down the drugs they gravitated toward. Instead, they focus on the illness they share, and the future.

During a recent meeting, when it was his turn to talk, Mr. Arconti said: “I’m happy to be here. I’m mentally and spiritually feeling well.”

Nationally, more students are seeking treatment. Last year, about one in two patients at the Minnesota youth treatment center of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation were being treated for opioid addiction. In 2010, one in six were. And the number of opioid-related claims for coverage by Blue Cross Blue Shield has almost doubled since 2010 for college-age patients.

The Haven at Drexel is part of a network called the Haven at College, which started in 2012 with one residence, at the University of Southern California, where young people could bond over a common struggle. Now there are five — four on or near California campuses and the one at Drexel — housing more than 50 young adults.

The umbrella organization is run by two former users — alcohol and heroin were their drugs of choice. The cost is $1,900 to $3,800 a month, which can be defrayed by financial aid, alumni funds earmarked for recovery and Haven work-study. Students who live in the houses receive meals, coaching from a licensed clinician and support from a house manager who monitors their whereabouts. There are curfews for newcomers, penalties for missing them and chores for everyone.

But mostly, students say, there is camaraderie.

Most of the houses are near dorms or fraternity houses, in what Holly Sherman, a founder and the executive director, calls the “war zone of party central.” Still, or perhaps because of this, it is not uncommon to have dozens of people show up for the Saturday night meeting.

Ms. Sherman says students arrive on campus and wonder: “‘How am I going to stay sober if I can’t find a sober community?’ What we do is work with the university to establish that community for them.”

Matthew, a 24-year-old former varsity athlete, sometimes attends the meetings. A May graduate of Albright College in Reading, Pa., he asked that his last name not be used because he wants to work as a financial adviser or analyst at a Fortune 500 company. But the opioid obsession he developed in college is getting in the way. He hopes the experiences of other students, many of whom know well the allure of opioids but have managed to kick the habit, will rub off on him.

He was handed a “Perc” freshman year by an older teammate he looked up to. At the time, he was at a small Catholic college in a Philadelphia suburb. “I’m in college,” he recalled thinking. “Let’s experiment, let’s party. He’s cool. I want to be cool.”

Soon after, a dealer introduced him to heroin. He began snorting before class, while doing homework and instead of going to parties and drinking. The heroin made all the drudgeries — homework, dining hall food, boring classes — seem manageable. “During Accounting 101, I’m in the bathroom snorting heroin, thinking: ‘I’ve got to get back to class.’”

When he transferred to Albright College, he dialed back on the heroin and returned to Percocet. Last summer, shortly after graduating, he went to a rehabilitation center in Florida.

“I’m not ready to just throw my life away for a stupid blue pill,” he said, perched on a weathered coach in the recovery center living room. Still, he acknowledged, he struggles to kick the habit. “I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. I’ve got really big goals.”",Opioids on the Quad,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/education/edlife/opioids-college-recovery-addiction.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“Chefs are part of that trend now, too,” Mr. Ottenhoff said. “They’re starting to say, ‘Look, people are in need of not just food but good food, and we know how to serve large quantities of good food very quickly.’”

Kimberly Grant, the chief executive of Mr. André’s Think Food Group, which runs 27 restaurants, put it like this: “Who else can take raw ingredients that are seemingly unassociated and make them into delicious food and do it under extreme pressure?”

Restaurateurs have long offered food when trouble hit their communities.

Kitchens near the World Trade Center in New York served thousands of meals each day to emergency workers after 9/11. In response to the 2004 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, the celebrity chef Cat Cora started Chefs for Humanity. Competition barbecue teams that headed to Joplin, Mo., after the 2011 tornadoes organized themselves into Operation BBQ Relief, a nonprofit group that has since responded to more than 40 disasters.

Two weeks ago, a food writer in Northern California tapped the region’s best chefs to provide a steady stream of meals for people who had lost homes to wildfires. The restaurateur and TV personality Guy Fieri, who had to evacuate his Santa Rosa residence, organized a team of volunteers and began serving mashed potatoes and pork loin to firefighters and others in a parking lot.

Mr. Andrés helped out after Hurricane Sandy, but his first big lesson in emergency food relief came in August, when he rallied local chefs in Houston to help feed survivors of Hurricane Harvey.

Other Houston chefs and caterers started a website called “I Have Food I Need Food” and used social media to create a system to organize donations, cook food and get it delivered. They codified their effort in a manual and send it to chefs in Miami who were staring down Hurricane Irma, which landed 16 days later.

Mr. Andrés went to Houston in part to study how to expand the scope of World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit association of chefs he established in 2011 after helping Haiti earthquake victims a year earlier. The idea was to learn how he and Brian MacNair, World Central Kitchen’s executive director, could add emergency food relief to an agenda that already included building school kitchens, organizing culinary training and offering other forms of support in several countries.

But nothing prepared Mr. Andrés for what he faced in Puerto Rico. After taking one of the first commercial flights to the island after the storm, he realized that things were worse than anyone knew.

He found his friend Jose Enrique, the chef who has been leading Puerto Rico’s farm-to-table resurgence. Mr. Enrique had no electricity to run his Restaurant Jose Enrique, in the Santurce district of San Juan. Rain poured through the roof. But he had food in the freezer. Other chefs did, too. Someone had a generator.

“We decided we would just start cooking,” Mr. Enrique said.

The next morning, Mr. Andrés went to a food distributor and loaded up his car. “I was already smart enough to know I would need aluminum pans, so I bought every aluminum pan I could,” he said.

They began cooking big pots of the classic island stew called sancocho on the street in front of Mr. Enrique’s small restaurant. Word spread and the lines grew. They sent food to people waiting in 10-hour lines at gas stations. They heard that workers at the city’s biggest medical clinic were going hungry, so they added it to what was now a makeshift delivery schedule. “Every day it would just double,” Mr. Enrique said.

Mr. Andrés didn’t realize that his was the biggest hot-food game on the island until a week or so after they started. Someone from the Salvation Army pulled up and asked for 120 meals.

“In my life I never expected the Salvation Army to be asking me for food,” he said. “If one of the biggest NGOs comes to us for food, who is actually going to be feeding Puerto Rico? We are. We are it.”

More cooks arrived to help. Partnerships were forged with other aid groups and large food companies. Sandwiches and fruit were added to their repertory of rice dishes.

The team moved its base of operation to the island’s largest arena. To pay for it all, at least in the beginning, they used Mr. Andrés’s credit cards, or cash from the pockets of the Orvis fly-fishing vest he wore like a battle jacket.

Mr. Andrés left the island only a few times, the first after 11 days on the ground. He had lost 25 pounds and became dehydrated.

His team deployed food trucks, like a strike force, to isolated neighborhoods and towns that needed help. Agents of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, were serving as emergency workers, and staying in the same hotel as Mr. Andrés’s crew. The chef persuaded them to load food into their vehicles every morning as they headed out to patrol.

With limited ability to communicate, the crew organized everything with satellite phones, WhatsApp and a big paper map of all the feeding stations on the island, which Mr. Andrés carried like a general at war.

He negotiated with a chain of vocational schools around the island to let culinary students cook there. During visits to his kitchens, 18 in all, he admonished volunteers to add more mayonnaise to sandwiches, keep the temperature up on the pans of rice or serve bigger portions.

The Compass Group, a giant American food-service operation that Mr. Andrés recently partnered with, sent someone who understood what it takes to feed several thousand people at a time.

Mr. Andrés recruited his own chefs, too. David Thomas, accustomed to making $540 suckling pigs as the executive chef at Mr. Andrés’s Bazaar Meat restaurant in Las Vegas, suddenly found himself trying to figure out how to make meals out of donations that might include 5,000 pounds of lunch meat one day and 17 pallets of yogurt the next.

The operation grew so big that at one point you couldn’t find any sliced cheese in all of Puerto Rico. The team had bought it all up for sandwiches.

Eventually, the effort would cost World Central Kitchen about $400,000 a day, paid for by donations from foundations, celebrities and a flood of smaller donors, as well as two Federal Emergency Management Agency contracts — one early on to cover the cost of 140,000 meals, and another for $10 million to cover two weeks’ worth of meals while Mr. Andrés’s team scaled down the operation.

Mr. Andrés, who often rolls right over regulations and ignores the word “no,” clashed more than once with FEMA and other large organizations that have a more-seasoned and methodical approach. In meetings and telephone calls, FEMA officials reminded him that he and his people lacked the experience needed to organize a mass emergency feeding operation, he said.","José Andrés Fed Puerto Rico, and May Change How Aid Is Given",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/dining/jose-andres-puerto-rico.html

In fact, MANAFORT and GATES had: selected Company A and Company B; engaged in weekly scheduled calls and frequent emails with Company A and Company B to provide them directions as to specific lobbying steps that should be taken; sought and received detailed oral and written reports from these firms on the lobbying work they had performed; communicated With Yanukovych to brief him on their lobbying efforts; both congratulated and reprimanded Company A and Company B on their lobbying work; communicated directly with United States officials in connection with this work; and paid the lobbying firms over $2 million from offshore accounts they controlled, among other things. In addition, court-authorized searches of MANAFORT and GATES’ DMI email accounts and MANAFORT’S Virginia residence in July 2017 revealed numerous documents, including documents related to lobbying, which were more than thirty-days old at the time of the November 2016 letter to the Department of Justice.

In July, Mr. Mueller’s team and the F.B.I. executed an unusual search warrant at Mr. Manafort’s home in Virginia in which, rather than knocking on his front door, they picked the lock and burst inside, seizing documents and copying computer files. Such an unannounced intrusion is permitted only when prosecutors convince a judge that a defendant may destroy evidence if given any warning.

The indictment suggests what was behind the raid. After questions arose about whether Mr. Manafort had failed to register as a foreign agent for Ukraine, his firm denied the allegations but also told federal investigators in November 2016 that they had no records about the work because their policy is to destroy emails after 30 days.

This line in the indictment shows what prosecutors found in that raid: documents related to his lobbying for Ukraine that Mr. Manafort’s lobbying company had told federal investigators did not exist — one of the bases for charges of making false statements.

Hiding foreign bank accounts

Furthermore, in each of MANAFORT’s tax filings for 2008 through 2014, MANAFORT represented falsely that he did not have authority over any foreign bank accounts. MANAFORT and GATES had repeatedly and falsely represented in writing to MANAFORT’s tax preparer that MANAFORT had no authority over foreign bank accounts, knowing that such false representations would result in false MANAFORT tax filings. For instance, on October 4, 2011, MANAFORT’S tax preparer asked MANAFORT in writing: “At any time during 2010, did you [or your wife or children] have an interest in or a signature or other authority over a financial account in a foreign country, such as a bank account, securities account or other financial account?” On the same day, MANAFORT falsely responded “NO.” MANAFORT responded the same way as recently as October 3, 2016, When MANAFORT’S tax preparer again emailed the question in connection with the preparation of MANAFORT’s tax returns: “Foreign bank accounts etc.?” MANAFORT responded on or about the same day: “NONE.”

Americans who hold assets in offshore bank accounts are required to disclose information about those holdings to the federal government, including for tax purposes. The indictment alleges that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates violated those laws.

Defrauding lenders

After MANAFORT used his offshore accounts to purchase real estate in the United States, he took out mortgages on the properties, thereby allowing MANAFORT to have the benefits of liquid income without paying taxes on it. Further, MANAFORT defrauded the banks that loaned him the money so that he could withdraw more money at a cheaper rate than he otherwise would have been permitted.

The indictment shows how the investigators’ deep scrutiny of Mr. Manafort’s financial dealings helped them uncover additional alleged offenses that resulted in charges. For example, Mr. Manafort “used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income,” according to the indictment, by having his overseas entities buy real estate and then taking out mortgages on those properties, freeing up cash.

The indictment details several such transactions in which Mr. Manafort is accused of falsely telling the bank he was either living in the properties or was using the borrowed funds for construction, thereby gaining access to a lower interest rate.

Conspiracy against the United States

From in or about and between 2006 and 2017, both dates being approximate and inclusive, in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, the defendants PAUL J. MANAFORT JR., and RICHARD W. GATES III, together with others, knowingly and intentionally conspired to defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful governmental functions of a government agency, namely the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury, and to commit offenses against the United States, to wit, the violations of law charged in Counts Three through Six and Ten through Twelve.

The first charge against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates is conspiracy, a powerful tool used by prosecutors. Two people are guilty of the crime of conspiracy if they agreed to commit a crime and took any step toward that goal. Conspiracy charges also permit prosecutors to hold each defendant responsible for the actions of the others within a plot. Here is a primer on how conspiracy charges may fit into the Trump-Russia probe.

An unusual basis for money laundering charges

(a) transport, transmit, and transfer monetary instruments and funds from places outside the United States to and through places in the United States and from places in the United States to and through places outside the United States, with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity, to wit: a felony Violation of the FARA, in Violation of Title 22, United States Code, Sections 612 and 618 (the “Specified Unlawful Activity”), contrary to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(a)(2)(A); and (b) conduct financial transactions, affecting interstate and foreign commerce, knowing that the property involved in the financial transactions would represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, and the transactions in fact would involve the proceeds of Specified Unlawful Activity, knowing that such financial transactions were designed in whole and in part (i) to engage in conduct constituting a Violation of sections 7201 and 7206 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and (ii) to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of the proceeds of the Specified Unlawful Activity, contrary to Title 18, United States Code, Section 19S6(a)(1)(A)(ii) and l956(a)(1)(B)(i).

Money laundering charges require that the financial transactions involved be designed to conceal that funds came from an underlying unlawful activity. Typically, such charges are pegged to a crime like drug trafficking. Here, prosecutors say, the underlying activity is instead the failure by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to register as a foreign agent while conducting lobbying activities for Ukraine that were otherwise lawful in and of themselves. That is an aggressive move by Mr. Mueller’s team.

Mueller is going after Manafort’s assets

52. Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim, P. 32.2, notice is hereby given to the defendants that the United States will seek forfeiture as part of any sentence in accordance with Title 18, United States Code, Sections 981(a)(1)(C) and 982(a)(1) and(a)(2), and Title 28, United States Code, Section 2461(c), in the event of the defendants’ convictions under Count Two of this Indictment.

As part of the pressure Mr. Mueller and his team are putting on Mr. Manafort, they are signaling in this indictment that if he is convicted of various charges, the government will seek to seize various properties and a life insurance policy linked to those charges — or any other assets he may have, if those are no longer available. This gives Mr. Manafort an additional incentive to cooperate as part of a plea deal that could allow his family to keep some of those assets.

Where will Mueller go next?

Photo

Mr. Mueller’s personal signature appears at the end of this indictment, a rare direct acknowledgment of his work. Little has been heard in public from Mr. Mueller since he took the assignment of special counsel, even as political commentary about him and his work has raged — especially from President Trump, who has called the special counsel investigation a “witch hunt” and on Monday reiterated on Twitter that there was “no collusion” with Russia and said of the indictment, “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.”

The indictment, though undoubtedly significant, also raises the question of what Mr. Mueller’s next step will be. But it is widely believed that Mr. Mueller is hoping to pressure Mr. Manafort into flipping and becoming a cooperating witness, providing information about the central subject of his investigation: the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia.",What It Means: The Indictment of Manafort and Gates,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/special-counsel-indictments.html

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season?","Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.

In the first episode of the new season of “Stranger Things,” we saw a mysterious, inflamed storm bearing down on Hawkins. By the end of the nine-episode run its identity had been revealed: Puberty.

That strangest thing of all shared screen time, of course, with the latest disaster to emerge out of the Hawkins Lab, which loosed malevolent vines and “Demodogs” upon the luckless town and again made poor Will Byers, who really has had a terrible year, captive to an otherworldly demon. Hopper almost died at least once, and Joyce was again pushed to the brink by both her boyfriend Bob’s brutal Demomauling and her son’s tribulations.

via Giphy

But the success of the very good second season of “Stranger Things” is largely thanks to the equal tribute it paid to the often scary convulsions of adolescence, whether it was a heartbroken Mike being a pill to everyone or an equFally despondent Eleven shattering windows with her angst.

The nerds left the basement and looked for love amid the monsters, dividing Dustin and Lucas as each pined after the new girl Max. Nancy and Jonathan took their relationship to the next level, with the help of a vodka-swilling conspiracy cupid. Eleven went through a rebellious phase, running away and dabbling in shoplifting as she questioned her own identity, before returning with a moody new “MTV punk” look.

The attention given to their growth and struggles elevated a season that, while suspenseful, was pretty repetitive from a plot standpoint — the lab screwed up, Will was victimized, monsters escaped, Eleven saved the day. For all of the 1980s blockbuster references and “Stranger Things 2” Hollywood sequel marketing, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer clearly get that in TV, investing in your characters what makes viewers invest in your show.

As with last season, the story got going efficiently. Will beheld a tentacled shadow monster in the Upside Down and Dustin took in a slimy creature whose true nature wasn’t revealed until it feasted on the family pet. (“I’m sorry,” Dustin told Dart as he locked it in the cellar. “You ate my cat.”)

Nancy mourned Barb, getting smashed on Halloween party punch and setting out with Jonathan to get proof of the lab’s complicity in her death. At the rustic Chez Hopper, the chief and Eleven ate TV dinners and had fights fueled by past traumas: She chafed at her captivity by a domineering father figure, shades of Papa Modine, while he fretted about losing another little girl.

Things intensified after Will got terrible advice from Bob about how to deal with monster — basically, face it and tell it to go away — which resulted in the boy becoming part of it instead. The show cleverly played with Will’s connection to the menace, revealing him to be not a “spying” asset but rather a double-agent liability, a threat to manage with tricks and a series of hypodermic needles. (Again: Will’s had a tough time.)

The monster lacked the horrifying, Gothic edge of last year’s Demogorgon. So it was a big spidery storm beast that controlled wicked vines and devil dogs? Or what? And aren’t we full up on smoke/shadow monsters after “Lost,” “Game of Thrones” and probably others I’m forgetting? But its amorphousness did make for some of the season’s most terrifying scenes, such as the moment at the end of the third episode when it invaded Will’s body.

Noah Schnapp in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

As Will, Noah Schnaap was the linchpin of the season after being offscreen for most of the first one. He was a marvel, by turns heartbreaking, explaining to Joyce the hold the monster had on him, and creepy. (“He likes it cold.”) With his sensitive, soulful eyes and bowl-cutted fragility, Will looks like the result of someone at the Hawkins lab splicing D.N.A. of Elliott from “E.T.” and Danny Torrance from “The Shining.” But by the end he was in full Linda Blair mode, raging convincingly against the space-heater exorcism that eventually set him free (for now, at least).

The rest of the kids retained their power to charm even as the show asked more of them, too, this time around, splitting them into subplots that were more emotionally demanding than last year’s bike-bound adventures.

Finn Wolfhard was prickly and tender as Mike, a boy who didn’t know what do to with all of his feelings, culminating in his meltdown with Hopper. Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas) gave a fine portrayal of a fraught rite of passage: The first time your loyalties are torn between your pals and your crush. As Dustin, Gaten Matarazzo carried entire stretches of the show by himself. His fraternal bond with Steve (Joe Keery) — whose redemption was as delightful as it was unexpected — was maybe the most touching love story of the season.

Millie Bobbie Brown proved that she wasn’t a one-season wonder, telegraphing Eleven’s varying shades of pain with great nuance and holding her own with David Harbour through the push-and-pull of their complex, evolving relationship. (Will someone please wipe her bloody nose though?) And while the kids get most of the attention, the show simply doesn’t work without Mr. Harbour’s and Winona Ryder’s deeply felt performances.

The newcomers were more of a mixed bag. Sadie Sink (Max) was a spirited addition to the “party” (the term refers to a team of players collaborating within a role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons). Brett Gelman was sublimely obnoxious as the investigator Murray Bauman. Sean Astin’s flair for openhearted, St. Bernard-like devotion was ideal for Bob the sacrificial galoot.

Dacre Montgomery in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

But after Billy’s (Dacre Montgomery) strong Scorpions-fueled arrival, the show seemed to lose sight of what to do with him. By the end he was an unfocused denim-wrapped bundle of rage and tire squeals. (I did enjoy his final episode moment with Mrs. Wheeler, though.)

Then there was the ill-advised detour into a Pat Benatar video. After Eleven went down the mental misery hole with her addled mother, she was moved to seek out the other lab refugee she saw in the flashbacks, and who we saw, in the season-opening scene, using telepathy to thwart the Pittsburgh police. This was Kali, and it turns out she was not part of a robber gang, as it initially seemed, but was leading a crew of misfits on a revenge quest against those who had persecuted her at the lab.

Kali was the Darth Vader to Eleven’s Luke Skywalker, urging her to give in to her hate and draw her power from the dark side of the Upside Down force. While Eleven flirted with the notion, she ultimately realized that revenge meant orphaning others, the way she had been, and decided to head home and save her friends instead.

It was perhaps worthwhile, from a character development standpoint, to have Eleven confront and make uneasy peace with her anger, and see what she might have become had she not found such loving support in Hawkins. But from the on-the-nose opening musical cue — Bon Jovi’s “Runaway” as she was literally running away — the episode was a mishmash of bad barrel-fire ’80s urban cliché and overwrought conflict. It didn’t help that the vengeful and manipulative Kali, with her sinister eyeliner, was a clear callback to “Temple of Doom” (Kali ma!), which took heat even in 1984 for its ghoulish depiction of Indian culture. (Tone-deaf exoticism is one reference the Duffer Brothers should have left in the ’80s.)

Eleven got a sweet makeover out of it, at any rate, returning to Hawkins looking like Trinity from the “Matrix.” She arrived just in time to close the interdimensional gate — did we really need Will to give us this obvious bit of strategy? — and get a birth certificate of her very own, completing her transformation from a gifted but tormented science project to Jane Hopper, a real-live girl with a mother and father. Whatever transpires in future “Stranger Things” installments, she’ll have that going for her.



One surprise was how long it took Eleven to rejoin her crew from the first season. They didn’t get together until the very end and even then, spent only minutes in each other’s company. It was an audacious and unexpected choice, as well as a slightly disappointing one given their shared chemistry. (There’s always next year, I guess, as promised by the final shot of a still-raging Upside Down.)

But it was of a piece with a season that throughout poignantly gestured at that fraught time when we all leave the basement and face life’s terrors and thrills on our own, as glimpsed in the culminating sequence at the Snow Ball ’84. After the four boys assembled on the fringes, one by one they left for new frontiers on the dance floor, with mixed results. (Oh Dustin, your time will come.)

It was a remarkable little scene and the perfect ending, capturing the anxiety, excitement, terror and occasional heartbreak that follows when you leave the cocoon of your party and enter a world that only gets stranger.

A Few Thoughts While We Enjoy a Baby Ruth

• “What’s at the X?” Bob wondered as he looked at Will’s map. “Pirate treasure?” You may recall that as Mikey in “The Goonies,” one of the ur-texts of “Stranger Things,” Sean Astin led the hunt for One-Eyed Willy’s loot. It was one of several fun meta moments this season. (See also: Max dismissing Lucas’s description of last season’s events as “a little derivative in parts.”)

• In the premiere recap I doubted that Dr. Owens was truly on Joyce’s side, as he said, but it turns out he more or less was. I probably should have guessed the Duffers would upend expectations attached to the lab doctors, after Matthew Modine’s evil turn, and Paul Reiser, who played a duplicitous character in “Aliens,” another of this series’ touchstones.

• “Mistakes have been made,” Dr. Owens told Nancy and Jonathan. “You killed Barbara,” Nancy countered. “Abundant mistakes,” he replied.

• R.I.P. Barb, finally.

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season? Were you fine with Eleven being away from the main action for so long? How many puffs of Farrah Fawcett Hair Spray does it take you to achieve Harrington-like coif perfection?

Your wife is still angry with you, still feels aggrieved and mistrustful. You’ve gone to counseling, but she hasn’t reconciled herself to a husband who, early in a marriage, was swapping sexual pics with another woman. You think she’s being unpleasantly manipulative; she may think she’s reminding you that you’re on probation, that you have further to go to earn back her trust.

It’s often said that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. In this case, your marriage is now on its sickbed. One issue here is how much you and your wife value it. That’s hard for an outsider to assess. Anger, like love, isn’t a voluntary emotion; you can’t simply decide to dial it up or down. But surely your wife isn’t the only angry spouse in your marriage. You say you felt emotionally abused by your wife even during the affair (a serious complaint); you think your relationship isn’t healthy, “but it’s what I’ve got” — not exactly a Hallmark sentiment. Do you truly think that getting rid of those pics would fix what’s wrong here? If your counselor made a list of what was rotten in your marriage, I doubt your wife’s vengeful lock screen would make the Top 10.

I have been divorced for many years. My ex-husband is now married to a dentist. As part of our divorce agreement, I am responsible for the children’s health insurance, including dental coverage. There were no issues until I had a brief period of unemployment. When I got a new job, it included health and dental insurance, but there was a waiting period for coverage. To cover that brief period, I bought health insurance for myself and my children but did not purchase dental insurance.

During that time, my ex-husband took our daughter to the dentist for a checkup. The dental practice my daughter visits is her stepmother’s office. When my ex-husband sent me the bill for this visit, which came to $400, I asked if the visit could be postdated by just a day, so I could submit it for insurance. He told me that doing so was illegal and that I needed to pay, and that he didn’t appreciate the fact that I didn’t have any dental coverage.

I asked my daughter why she didn’t let me know about the appointment so I could let her know our dental insurance ended. She said she thought that because it was her stepmother’s office, she was fine.

Since that time I have been receiving bills from this dental practice. I have had conversations with their accounts-payable department to let them know that my daughter is the dentist’s stepdaughter. But no understanding was reached; I have not paid, as I believe it’s wrong to have charged me when it was known that I didn’t have company insurance at the time. I am now getting bills from a collection agency for the $400.

So my question for you is: Do I pay it just to make it go away or try again to reason with my ex-husband and his wife to please drop these fees? Name Withheld

Communication between ex-spouses can be like pulling teeth. So it’s not surprising that you didn’t warn your husband that it would be financially inconvenient for your daughter to have dental treatment at that time. Given that you are in charge of medical insurance, you could reasonably think it odd that your child was taken for a dental visit without your knowledge. But again, not so surprising, especially if your daughter’s teeth are normally looked after at her stepmother’s office.

While your husband is correct that it would be wrong and could be illegal to file a false claim, he and his wife might have been able to help you by agreeing to lower the costs or to spread them out. The fact that the charge was sent to a collection agency also sounds less than cordial. Still, if I understand the situation correctly, you were in breach of your divorce agreement, even if your reasons were entirely understandable. Absent any information from you to the contrary, then, he was entitled to assume that your daughter was covered. You’re asking him and his wife to cover costs that you are liable for.

One of the bright lights in this celebration has been the series of crosswords made by celebrity and veteran constructor teams, paired up by crosswords editor Will Shortz.

All of the celebrities that created puzzles for The New York Times were avid solvers, but none had undertaken the task of constructing a crossword before, except for former president Bill Clinton, who had a slight advantage after making one with constructor Cathy Allis (then Millhauser) for The New York Times Magazine in 2007 (answers to that puzzle are here). Each celebrity expressed surprise at how difficult it was to create a New York Times-worthy crossword, but they all had this in common: they stuck with it and they are now published New York Times Crossword constructors.

10 Places That Define New York City, Reimagined

New York is a city of landmarks: world famous skyscrapers, grand monuments and cultural icons. But many of its must-see places each came shockingly close to becoming something completely different, some for better, some for worse. Visiting the sites of these remarkable unbuilt schemes can heighten the enjoyment of touring the things that actually got built. You could see dozens of unbuilt plans at the new Queens Museum exhibition , and in the book “Never Built New York” (Metropolis Books, 2016). Or roam the city, with these visions in the back of your mind.

Central Park

Central Park is, in every sense, the “Clearing in the Distance” that Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux originally imagined it should be. It is a bucolic idyll hemmed in by an uproarious metropolis.

Now spread out on the Great Lawn and imagine a completely different landscape : perfectly symmetrical, flattened formal gardens composed of topiaries patterned as stars and spirals and paisley flowers.

That was the engineer John Rink’s 1857 rigidly whimsical vision for the park, one of the entries submitted to the city-sponsored competition. A few years later, the architect Richard Morris Hunt argued that what the “silent stretch of rural landscape…” lacked was the “artistic grandeur of Paris.”

Image John Rink’s plan for Central Park Credit New York Historical Society

Hunt’s dream was to position a series of gates throughout the park, including the “Gate of Peace,” a huge semicircular terrace framing a 50-foot-high column leading to a pair of stair-stepped cascades that would feed a basin below, on the southeast end of the park. It had all the grandiloquence, Calvert Vaux sneered, of Napoleon III.

Farther west along 59th Street, at the intersection of Sixth Avenue, might have been home to yet another reimagined Central Park – this, from the fecund pen of Ernest Flagg , the noted architect, circa 1904. The park would have been drastically cinched. He proposed a slender mall that would run the entire length of Manhattan, subsuming a thin strip of the park and Sixth Avenue, too.

Of course Olmsted and Vaux’s pastoral vision won out (as it did in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park), and their creation is today considered hallowed ground that not even the most determined designer would dream of altering.

Grand Central Terminal

Grand Central Terminal, with its celestial ceiling and unshakable aura of Beaux-Arts magnificence, is arguably the grandest space in New York. But it almost suffered the same fate as its exceptional sibling, Penn Station, whose above ground structure, designed by McKim, Mead & White, was demolished to heighten the value of air rights amid the railroads’ decline. As pressure to use the air rights above Grand Central Station mounted, developers tried time and again to propose lofty alternatives.

Image I.M. Pei’s Hyperboloid Credit Pei Cobb Freed

The gutsiest was I.M. Pei’s Hyperboloid, sponsored by the developer William Zeckendorf, in 1956. The hourglass-shaped design, whose altitude would have surpassed that of the Empire State Building, was light years ahead of its time, incorporating a weblike steel exoskeleton to support the open floors within. Squint and you’d think you were in Dubai, 2016.

More than a decade later, the developer UGP Properties proposed Marcel Breuer’s 175 Park Avenue, a modernist slab — mirroring Walter Gropius’s Pan Am Building just north — that would have rammed right through the station’s Grand Concourse (and in a later plan, would replace its facade). Preservationists, led by none other than Jacqueline Onassis, fought the project all the way to the Supreme Court, winning a battle that finally gave the fledgling movement much-needed momentum.

The city renewed its love affair with Grand Central, and almost 20 years later the station was renewed with the completion of a $200 million restoration, highlighted by a thorough cleaning of Paul César Helleu’s magnificent gold-leafed Zodiac mural on the ceiling of the Main Concourse.

Ellis Island

There are few places as evocative as the Great Hall of Ellis Island, where thousands upon thousands came to the New World. After the federal government decommissioned the island in 1954, it opened the site to developers, who proposed all manner of projects, from a resort to a university to a prison.

The highest bid came from the Damon Doudt Corporation, which commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to sketch a city-within-a-city called the Key Plan, consisting of stacked living spaces arranged around a large open plaza surrounded by bubble-shaped buildings containing theaters, a planetarium and much more. The plan was conceived by Frank Lloyd Wright, but the drawings were executed by his successor firm, Taliesen Associated Architects.

Wright, not surprisingly, would have designed every square inch of the development, including the boats to get there. None of the proposals were accepted, and later the National Park Service commissioned Philip Johnson to turn the site into a nostalgic landmark. Vines would have overgrown what would become a neglected ruin; side by side with Johnson’s 130-foot-tall, ziggurat-shaped tower dedicated to the millions of immigrants who had first disembarked there.

Instead, Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc , and Beyer Blinder Belle , restored the main building of the station over the course of eight years, and it reopened as home to the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration in 1990. It has received more than 40 million visitors since.

Columbus Circle

Crossing into Columbus Circle on foot is daunting. Cars, buses and cabs decidedly have the upper hand. It’s much simpler to circumnavigate it rather than wade into the circle itself.

Travel backward in time to 1948, however, and in an alternate universe you might have encountered a genuinely futuristic construct that allowed you to cross the circle, in style. Matthew Nowicki, a Polish émigré architect, hoped to encircle the vexing roundabout with an elevated linear accelerator-cum-shopping center.

His promenade, lined by stores and cafes, would have been a sleek, white, 60-foot-wide saucer with two loops. One, facing the Columbus Monument, was an exterior colonnade whose “columns” were the exposed steel arcs supporting a poured-in-place concrete roof. The other, outer loop, was enclosed by 20-foot-high floor-to-ceiling glass windows tilted toward the surrounding streets. You could have walked the 1,100-foot circumference, master of the streets below, levitated two stories above the roadway.

It was never built. A full renovation of Columbus Circle completed in 2005 included a new fountain, benches and green space. By far the largest development on the circle is the Time Warner Center, which contains CNN’s studios, the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Jazz at Lincoln Center and some of the fanciest shopping and dining in the city. Around the circle, the Museum of Arts and Design (MAD) opened inside Edward Durell Stone’s refaced Huntington Hartford Gallery of Modern Art.

Times Square

In recent years Times Square has become a syrupy sweet haven for tourists and a hated destination for everyone else. But what if the land that has been transformed from porn empire to outdoor mall had an entirely different precedent?

Just before the Great Depression, the designer Joseph Urban proposed the Reinhardt Theater, an Art Deco masterpiece “wedding beauty and ballyhoo” with a black glass facade offset with intricate golden metalwork. “A theater is more than a stage and auditorium,” Urban wrote in his 1929 book, “Theaters.” “It is a place to experience a heightened sense of life.” If only that were the case for Times Square today.

Another ambitious, but unrealized, precedent for the area would have been Ely Jacques Kahn’s Dowling Theater, a postwar fusion of Modernism with Art Deco’s bursts of neon color, texture and light.

Years later, Venturi Scott Brown proposed a tower for 42nd Street and 8th Avenue that would have announced itself with a fiery starburst, making Times Square’s omnipresent billboards a key element of the building’s design.

Times Square is still a constant work in progress. Its latest iteration is more pedestrian-friendly, thanks to five plazas that span almost two acres of space formerly occupied by bumper-to-bumper traffic.

Madison Square

When you think of Madison Square today, what springs to mind are recent staples like Shake Shack and Eataly, and immortal landmarks like the Flatiron Building and the clock tower of the Metropolitan Life building.

The area’s stately character would certainly have been stretched skyward had it not been for the Great Depression, which reduced the size of Henry Wiley Corbett’s Metropolitan Life North Annex from more than 100 stories to a scant 29. From Madison Square Park, consider the bulky stump and its relatively short size, and now hypothesize whether Lower Manhattan’s canyons would have been replicated here after its completion.

Another severe downturn, The Great Recession, killed Rem Koolhaas’s 24-story building at 23 East 22nd Street. Hoping to take advantage of the neighboring air rights, Koolhaas proposed a building that stepped its way out and up from its site, its cantilevered units containing glass bottoms. Another building killed by that downturn was Daniel Libeskind’s One Madison, an ethereal, vegetation-laced tower built on stilts, hovering above what is now the Credit Suisse Tower.

The Flatiron district is now booming — perhaps too quickly. Two of the newest towers erected in recent years are CetraRuddy’s 621-foot-tall One Madison, a vertical line of stacking cubes, and KPF’s 777-foot-tall 45 East 22nd Street, which cantilevers over an adjacent building.

Rem Koolhaas has set his sights on the area again: he is now planning his first New York residence down the street, 121 East 22nd Street.

Washington Square Park

It is the stomping ground of academics and potheads, hustlers and innocents, dissidents and wing-tipped businessmen, poets and folk singers.

Despite the domineering formality of the neo-Classical arch honoring the 100th anniversary of George Washington’s inauguration, Washington Square Park is certainly one of the city’s most deeply informal public spots.

But if you take a seat by the fountain, you are occupying a spot that would have been smack in the middle of the mini-freeway that the city’s former construction czar, Robert Moses, planned to build, slicing the park in half. As you looked through the arch, you’d have been watching cars speeding beneath its marble entablature, along a newly extended Fifth Avenue pushing south into Lower Manhattan.

Image Robert Moses' vision of what land use at Washington Square Park. Credit M.T.A. Archives

If Moses’s wider vision had been fulfilled, the lengthened artery would have served a whole new neighborhood of superblock apartment buildings he had designated to replace the “blighted slums” along the blocks south of the park to Houston Street. The historic streets eviscerated, Washington Square blanched and bloodless, you would have wondered why it was you’d decided to visit the park in the first place.

While Washington Square is in fact gleaming from a recent $30 million update, it has, like the village around it, lost much of its bohemian character. Now the major issue here is not blight, but gentrification.

Lincoln Center

Obligatory photos in front of Lincoln Center’s famous fountain would have been quite different if Wallace K. Harrison’s ambitious proposals for the Metropolitan Opera hadn’t been quashed by untold layers of bureaucracy. Before Harrison’s plans, sites for the Metropolitan Opera had been proposed near Columbus Circle, Rockefeller Center, the Museum of Modern Art and Washington Square.

None of those came to be, either. But once Lincoln Square was settled on, Harrison, the lead designer of the United Nations, proposed more than 50 designs. Most of them featured experiments with sculptural concrete, each more dazzling than the next; more evocative of the Sydney Opera House or J.F.K.’s TWA Terminal than the Rubik’s cubes of Lincoln Center.

But a consortium of officials wagged their heads at these plans, for budgetary and aesthetic reasons. The blandest design of all is the one that got built.

Lincoln Center completed a major overhaul, led by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, in 2010, but one of its most ambitious plans — a redesign of David Geffen Hall by Thomas Heatherwick and Diamond Schmitt Architects — was recently abandoned.

American Museum of Natural History

As you climb the subway steps to Central Park West, looming overhead is the faceted red-granite American Museum of Natural History, whose rusticated walls and 150-foot-tall towers look like a Brobdingnagian brownstone .

Race up the south entrance stairs, pause beneath the arches of the loggia, run your hands along the soft limestone pillars, and imagine a metamorphosis occurs: The vermilion walls peel away, fine dentils recede into flatness, turrets and towers, with their finials and conical caps, transform themselves into concise pyramids. The entire 77th Street front would butter itself over with a thin veneer of sober gray limestone.

The building, Aymar Embury’s 1942 conception, would be a windowless two-story base pierced by an entrance spaced precisely in the middle of a blank wall. The final effect: unenchanting institutional modernism indistinguishable from a government office building.

Since this proposal to wrap the museum in austere facing failed (as did Embury’s plan across town to replace the Metropolitan Museum’s steps with a circular driveway), the museum has continued to grow by accretion. In 1992 Kevin Roche built an eight-story library; in 2000, Polshek Partnership (now Ennead Architects) completed the Rose Center for Earth and Space; and now Studio Gang is planning the Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation.

Battery Park

Battery Park, at the southernmost tip of the city, might be the ideal starting point for an imaginary journey into Manhattan. A stroll along the bayside offers vistas of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and the Jersey skyline, and a view uptown of the seemingly unending escarpment of skyscrapers implanted on formerly Dutch colonial farmland.

The primo location has made the area the number one spot for unbuilt ventures. At least a half-dozen “watergates,” elaborate landings for dignitaries arriving by sea; a floating airport, by the genius industrial designer, Norman Bel Geddes; a bridge landing for the Brooklyn-Battery Bridge, in 1939; a Ferry Terminal building, with a giant big-screen clock by the postmodernist architects Venturi, Scott Brown ; the list goes on.

Image A proposed bridge would have connected to Battery Park. Credit Brooklyn Public Library

But none can match, for sheer bravado, the Obelisk by the architect Eric Gugler, in 1929. At 800 feet, the “Gateway to America,” would have dwarfed the Washington Monument by 250 feet. On axis with Broadway, the tower would have risen on 16 acres of landfill, extending Manhattan in a broad paved arc 400 feet into the bay. From Broadway, looking south, the obelisk would have stood out. From its observation deck, nearly 65 stories up, Brooklyn, Bayonne, Sandy Hook, Far Rockaway – the very curvature of the Earth – would have been within view.

These days Battery Park, with its unobstructed views of New York Harbor, is best known as the place to queue up to catch the ferry to Ellis Island or the Statue of Liberty. And while Louis Kahn never built his planned Holocaust Memorial on this site, it is also home to Kevin Roche’s ziggurat-shaped Museum of Jewish Heritage.

But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,” said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. “But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.”

That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing.

“I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,” Mr. Tucker said. “But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.”

If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

The classical pianist Emanuel Ax, whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear.

“I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,” Mr. Ax said. “Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.”

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

“If I’m like a field, I must be a field,” she says with annoyance, as he tries to explain the comparison. But the metaphor — or rather, the very idea of metaphor — lodges in her imagination. And she finds herself increasingly hungry for words that would capture the ineluctable — a puddle that’s clear instead of muddy, the shaking of leaves on a tree — in a landscape where “things change every day.”

On an errand for her husband, she meets the play’s third character, Gilbert Horn (Devin E. Haqq), the miller, who is both necessary to and despised by the crop-tending villagers. Gilbert owns books and, more important, a pen. And when the woman takes that pen in her hands, it seems to acquire a frenzied will of its own.

Mr. Takacs and his movement director, Yasmine Lee, who previously collaborated to haunting effect on Philip Ridley’s “Tender Napalm,” give expressive life to the physical relationships among these characters. There are a few moments in which the staging is confusing in conveying plot twists, although a lyrical ambiguity often feels appropriate.

The production is punctuated by a series of erotic pas de deux that suggest the satisfactions and limitations of sex. They are enacted, fittingly, within the claustrophobic confines of Steven C. Kemp’s rustic wooden set, lighted with hints of a mysterious world beyond by Dante Olivia Smith.

Dressed in rough garments (by Sydney Gallas) that evoke the early days of the Western frontier, the cast speaks in largely uninflected American accents (though Ms. Kerr is identified as Jamaican Scottish in her program biography). The performances are precisely focused without being intensely emotional.

Nonetheless, the sum effect of their talk and actions is deeply emotional. “I have no name for the thing which is in my head,” the Young Woman says at one point, with a wondering greed.

At that moment, which follows her first experience with pen and paper, you know exactly what she means.

“When I go to someone’s house, and they don’t have pictures, it’s not alive,” Mrs. Vanderpool said. “I like to see a family. I like to see a story.”

For her story, Mrs. Vanderpool points to pictures of herself and her husband lounging on a cruise ship, and in costume at Comic Con, where she dressed as the “Harry Potter” character Hermione Granger, and he as a colonel. There are pictures of each child’s first bath and first day of school, others with them playing video games or napping with their father.

Mr. Vanderpool’s absence had an immediate impact on Noel’s behavior. He got in fights at school, one provoked by a classmate who had mocked him for praying that his father would return to life.

“His grades were terrible,” Mrs. Vanderpool said. “He started failing. He wasn’t paying attention. It was a struggle to send him to school.”

Mrs. Vanderpool got Noel a Yorkshire terrier named Jack to provide him with much-needed companionship, and she also sought to find Noel a confidant outside the family.

In May, Noel, now 14, was matched with a big brother through Catholic Big Sisters & Big Brothers, an affiliate of Catholic Charities, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.

“My thinking of it is just to give him another outlet to talk to someone else, if he wants,” Mr. Green, 35, said. “I don’t push any agenda. If he wants to talk about something, I’m there to listen and help him think through stuff. Or to not talk and just wander around.”

Noel recently started his freshman year at New Design High School. Mrs. Vanderpool says Noel is on time for appointments and engaged in his studies, a difference she credits to Mr. Green and his active role in Noel’s life.

“I haven’t gotten one single call yet,” Mrs. Vanderpool said.

“I just paid the teachers off,” Noel joked.

The family faced another setback last year when Mrs. Vanderpool learned she had kidney cancer. Doctors performed surgery to remove a tumor, and she spent three and a half months away from her job.

Mrs. Vanderpool works in social services and earns $42,000 a year. Her monthly bills include $541 in rent and $500 for food, as well as a number of other expenses, including helping her mother, who has multiple sclerosis, with her bills. Additionally, Mrs. Vanderpool owes about $60,000 in student loans.

Catholic Charities used $340 from the Neediest Cases Fund at the start of the academic year to buy Noel new school clothes, including a winter coat and sneakers, and to buy work clothes for Mrs. Vanderpool. Additionally, Catholic Big Sisters & Big Brothers gave Noel a new backpack filled with school supplies.

Noel usually meets with Mr. Green every other week. Mr. Green, who works for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, chose the New York Transit Museum as one of their first outings. Other activities have included a bike ride near the South Street Seaport, a visit to the Irish Hunger Memorial in Battery Park City and an exploration of Green-Wood Cemetery and its mausoleums in Brooklyn.

“After you’ve been here a few years, your circle of the city shrinks,” Mr. Green said. “So it’s good for both of us to go out and explore neighborhoods.”

So far, Mr. Green has chosen all of the activities, but he expects that Noel will begin proposing ideas as he continues to emerge from his shell.

Unlike so many educators, Ms. Lenard seemed to understand that education isn’t just about presenting facts. It’s about connection. It’s about a specificity that will yank at some crucial part of you and draw — maybe even charm — you in. You will learn on your own terms.

For my 12-year-old self, a young woman who loved clothes, was frustrated by school pressures and ran around Paris like she owned it was a perfect role model. At that age, I could no more relate to the milquetoast individuals in other French textbooks than I could to, say, someone going through a midlife crisis.

“Jeunes Voix” achieved for me another of education’s primary goals: It opened up an enthralling new world, something to which I could aspire. Yvone Lenard’s characters lived life with all the Frenchness we Americans love to think they do. In her hands, the French-speaking universe seemed coated with fairy dust. So enchanted was I that, years later, I would fly off to Paris to study French at the Sorbonne for my own little Christine moment (I even brought a dress like one Christine wore). There, my French reached a fluidity, if not fluency, and my interest in other worlds led me to pursue a career as a travel writer.

Adult life being what it is, my French went unattended, but recently, with a milestone birthday approaching, I’ve decided to study for and take the French Ministry of Education’s proficiency exam, a horrifyingly intimidating test that certifies you as someone who has at least a respectable grasp of the language. Turning to my old, beloved textbook as a study guide, I started wondering about Yvone Lenard, who she was and how she came up with her characters. Could I even find her, now that the book was almost 50 years old?

An obsessive search through the warps and wefts of the internet yielded an email response within 48 hours:

Dear Ms. Lichterman,

I am deeply touched and appreciative of your kind words about ‘Jeunes voix’ and would be happy to meet you. I think we live close to each other so would you come for a very informal lunch . . . I am sure we’ll have much to talk about.

Yvone

Ms. Lenard, now 96, stood smiling, arms extended, on the walkway of her home, less than nine miles from where I live, in a Southern California city where neither of us is a native (I’m a product of New York City, she of southwestern France) and where each of us happened to move in our adulthoods.

Elegant, perfectly coifed, one of those people who seem lit from within, she greeted me, her perfect English enhanced by a distinctive, silky French accent. “I am so happy to meet you,” she said as she took both my hands in hers and led me to an outdoor table where she, her husband and I would eat courses of French food as I asked questions about “Jeunes Voix,” too shy to speak French.

It was her idea, she said, to focus on young people. “I had been dissatisfied,” she said, “not only with the way existing texts taught French, but with their illustrations, stock snapshots of anonymous people, locations, or the equivalent of tourist postcards.”

Christine Eustrade, I learned, was actually Christine Eustratiades, an 18-year-old French model who they “discovered” in a 1964 Life magazine spread titled “So Young, So Young,” featuring that fall’s collection. Not quite 15 when she first hit the modeling scene, Ms. Eustratiades was a star in the fashion world when Ms. Lenard’s husband, a professional photographer named Wayne Rowe, photographed her in Paris for “Jeunes Voix.”

Dr. Rowe would go on to teach photography at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, and Ms. Lenard to write more than a dozen books.

“Perhaps you could come over one afternoon, and we could sit here and speak French?” Ms. Lenard suggested as I got up to leave almost four hours later. And that’s when I realized something about her and, really, about all great teachers: It’s always about the connection.

While virtual-reality pornography may feel like something out of a science fiction movie, it already has a formidable, if underground, presence. According to website Pornhub, views of VR porn are up 275 percent since it debuted in the summer of 2016. Now the site is averaging about 500,000 views (on Christmas Day in 2016, this number shot up to 900,000.)

By 2025 pornography will be the third-largest VR sector, according to estimates prepared by Piper Jaffray, an investment and management firm. Only video games and N.F.L.-related content will be larger, it predicted, and the market will be worth $1 billion.

“We’re getting more and more of it every day,” said Mark Kernes, a senior editor at AVN Media Network, which covers the industry. “We are leading the technology in this area. Sex sells, and where there is money to be made, there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it,” some by offering it for free to increase clicks.

Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press, and spurred developments in the internet, online payment systems and other technology. Now it’s time for virtual reality, Mr. Kernes said: “I’m pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.”

Headsets Are Just the Beginning

Ms. Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3, a conference for the video-game industry. Excited by the pornography possibilities, she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star. Before long, Ms. Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles.

She was one of the first VR webcam women, according to Mr. Kernes. She then started a company named VRTube.xxx, which now employs over 40 performers.

Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate, considering the potential for abuse, disease and exploitation, the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues. For example, can you use someone’s likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality?

“Virtual reality is like the Wild Wild West,” said Bryony Cole, the host of “Future of Sex,” a podcast that explores technology and sexuality.

At this year’s AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas, the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display.

CamSoda, a website that specializes in live sex videos, had an exhibit featuring pornography stars dressed in plunging bathing suits and waving visitors into the booth. They were showing off OhRama, a small canister that attaches to virtual reality headsets and releases scent during the action. “Believe it or not, the scents were created by the girls,” said Mr. Kernes, who was there. “It’s sweet and musty. They know what they like.”

Photo

There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience.

Another big player is CamasutraVR, a start-up using 142 cameras that all look at one person, or one body part. “They are creating images from that, which they are hoping will be indistinguishable from an actual person,” Mr. Kernes said. “I’m sure those people wished they had been using that VR system at home.”

Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material. “As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator,” he said.

One of the most buzzed-about inventions has been the sex robot. The first one, Harmony, was introduced in May by a company named Realbotix. In seductive videos posted on YouTube, Harmony shows off her long legs, her firm breasts, her full lips, her lifelike hand gestures, even her intellect.

“How do you feel about sex?” an unknown presenter asks her in one video.

“Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world,” she responds in a raspy voice. “I don’t see anything wrong with it.” Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space; she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching.

“It’s a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi,” said Matt McMullen, the C.E.O. and creative director of Realbotix. The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality. “Based on our experiences with thousands of clients,” Mr. McMullen said, “people do use them for sex, but there is something more that exists. We focus on companionship.”

Virtual reality has been nicknamed the empathy machine because it allows people to feel like they are truly connected to the action. “It’s neurological,” said Holly Richmond, a somatic psychologist based in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. “You aren’t just watching and thinking about it. You are feeling it, and it’s not just your genitals. There is literally a mind-body connection.”

When Ms. Darling does live X-rated performances, users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen. “The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off,” she said. “They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.”

Many sex therapists and educators are interested in the new technology, just as a dentist might be with the latest plaque-detection gizmos. Ms. Richmond worked with BaDoinkVR, a virtual-reality company in Rochester, N.Y., to create Virtual Sexology, a series of free videos that help men and women overcome common sex problems.

A recent video, updated in June, takes women into the bedroom where they see how one blond, busty woman arouses herself before sex. She sits in front of her partner massaging her arms, her legs, her breasts. As her breathing heats up, a voice-over says that some women need to be physically touched before feeling any desire for sex. The first video, aimed at men, was the most downloaded video on BaDoinkVR.com in 2016 — an impressive feat considering it was competing with noneducational pornography.

Ms. Cole, the podcast host, is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education.

“What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?” she said. “Or they can be in a room with someone who said, ‘I contacted herpes and this is my experience.’ That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.”

Indeed.

Barbara Rothbaum, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emory’s Veterans Program, is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma.

The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks, tents, private living quarters, latrines, offices or remote buildings and vehicles, where the trauma may have taken place. The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace.

But for virtual reality to work, the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality. They have to feel like they are participants, not just observers. “We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them,” Ms. Cole said. As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen, issues are bound to arise.

Mr. McCullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize. His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used.

Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire. “What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?” she said. “What does consent mean in virtual reality? Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldn’t do in real life? If you are using someone’s likeness in virtual reality, do you require their permission? And what about revenge porn? That will be even harsher in virtual reality.”

She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps, drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters.

Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating. It is, after all, much more lifelike than traditional pornography.

But Mr. McCullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that, but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation, not causing it. “There are people who are already lonely, and people who live their lives being alone. They work all day and come home to an empty house,” he said. “This is just offering an alternative to those types of people. They don’t have anyone else.”",Virtual Reality Gets Naughty,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/style/virtual-reality-porn.html

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

73,"['love', 'aging', 'cleopatra', 'world', 'lie', 'antony', 'juliet', 'woman', 'life', 'choice', 'sex']","So here’s the subtle lie: a lonely aging woman, in an unhappy marriage, described as beautiful, cannot find an interesting lover.
Strauss’s subtle lie is that a wise aging woman will naturally make a staggeringly inappropriate erotic choice, jettisoning the search for love in a desperate burst of sexual eagerness.
The lie is that it is only in this form — where the aging woman makes a terrible choice, and then comes to her senses and renounces that choice — that an audience will accept the representation of the sex life and emotions of an aging woman.
Aging love always has baggage.
For Antony and Cleopatra, love is comic because of its bodily and temporal particularity.","And yet. The first lie of Strauss and his librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal — the one I will call “the obvious lie” — concerns inevitability. For women, according to the opera, getting old means surrender and renunciation. The Marschallin’s life, as she ages, must end up as sexless as the convent girl’s life from which it emerged. Audiences typically swallow the lie and applaud her sage retreat. Strauss plays a double game: He gains a reputation for daring by broaching the unusual theme, and yet he comforts his audience by saying something utterly conventional about it.

Now, however, we come to a more subtle lie. Why do audiences accept the inevitability of the Marschallin’s resignation? Consider her erotic choice. This is a woman who was taken from the convent into a loveless marriage, with a husband who is off hunting throughout the entire opera and doesn’t even bother to put in an appearance. So, if the Marschallin really is the wise woman she is supposed to be, what might she look for in a lover? Sex certainly, but that is not the exclusive offering of teenage boys. She would very likely also be looking for conversation, for humor and for real personal love. Instead, she turns to a boy who is no more than 17. She seeks a relationship that is based entirely on his infatuated sexual eagerness; it offers absolutely no possibilities of conversation or genuine personal intimacy, since Octavian, so far as we are allowed to know him, is a very stupid teenager, albeit with pretty manners.

The 18th-century Vienna in which the opera takes place surely contained many men of greater interest, many of them interested in love affairs with married women, since the world the opera depicts is permissive. So what has this wise woman with what one critic calls “acute sensibilities” and “profound understanding” done? Out of all the men around, she has chosen one who is interested in sex alone, who has no capacity for intelligent conversation, and who has no interest at all in her as a person, except as a sex teacher. Why did she make this choice? No plausible motive is suggested. And this absence of motive, particularly in one so wise, creates the lie: the implicit explanation is that this is the only option she has.

This “choice,” of course, explains why the demise of the relationship is felt as inevitable. There’s nothing to sustain it, and so Octavian may as well do as society expects and go marry the rich heiress, his fiancée, Sophie, to whom he has nothing interesting to say either. Soon it will be him off hunting in the countryside, and Sophie will be alone, living out the “inevitable” in her own generation.

The mismatch, of course, has nothing to do with age difference per se (as most commentators oddly suggest that it does). The inappropriateness concerns the fact that Octavian (besides being stupid) is much too young for a mature relationship.

So here’s the subtle lie: a lonely aging woman, in an unhappy marriage, described as beautiful, cannot find an interesting lover. All she can find is a hormonal boy who would sleep with anyone, and she takes what she can get. Strauss’s subtle lie is that a wise aging woman will naturally make a staggeringly inappropriate erotic choice, jettisoning the search for love in a desperate burst of sexual eagerness. And then, being wise, she will give that up and become resigned to a sexless life — apparently because no male not totally preoccupied with teenage hormonal excess will look in her direction. That’s not just a lie, it’s a generative lie, since when people come to believe it, it informs life.

Now we arrive at a third lie, the subtlest of all. The lie is that it is only in this form — where the aging woman makes a terrible choice, and then comes to her senses and renounces that choice — that an audience will accept the representation of the sex life and emotions of an aging woman. In other words, the aging woman has to be punished — and doubly punished, first by being thrust into a stupid and shallow relationship, and then by being made to give it up with high-minded talk about time and inevitability. It is very like the old days in which gay male relationships in fiction had to end with a death. Audiences wanted to punish gay men; they disapproved, and wanted novelists to register that disapproval. Audiences then and now want to punish the aging woman, and thus, aided by Strauss, they construct an aesthetic fiction of the “inevitability” of her renunciation and the “profound wisdom” of her acceptance.

Is this third lie, however, a lie? Is it really possible, audiences being what they are, to represent the sexual/romantic choices of an aging woman attractively, showing her making a good and interesting choice, and then being happy in that choice? To see that the answer to this question is “yes,” we need only turn to Shakespeare, and “Antony and Cleopatra” (1606). Of course, Shakespeare had history at his back, and Cleopatra is one of history’s most fascinating women. Her love affair with Antony was real, and lasted until death. Shakespeare had lived by then through the remarkable reign of a female monarch, Elizabeth, who died in 1603, and who was believed by many to have had a longtime lover; so he knew he could carry his audience with such a tale.

Unlike the dreamy abstractions of the youthful love in “Romeo and Juliet,” “Antony and Cleopatra” depicts what we might call mature love — love between people who enjoy being grown-ups together and who have no desire to transcend human life, because they are having too much fun in life as it is.

Romeo and Juliet don’t eat; Antony and Cleopatra eat all the time. Romeo and Juliet have no occupation; Antony and Cleopatra are friends and supportive colleagues with a great deal of work to do running their respective and interlocking empires. Romeo and Juliet have no sense of humor; Antony and Cleopatra live by elaborate jokes and highly personal forms of teasing. (“That time, — Oh times! — I laugh’d him out of patience …”) Romeo and Juliet, utterly absorbed, pay no attention to others around them; Antony and Cleopatra love to gossip about the odd people in their world, spend evenings wandering the streets, watching the funny things people do, structuring love through daily life. Romeo and Juliet speak in terms of worshipful hyperbole. Antony knows how to make contact with Cleopatra through insults, even about her age; she knows how to turn a story about a fishhook into a running joke that renews laughter each time it is mentioned.

The love between Antony and Cleopatra lasts for at least a decade, and the texture of time past, present and future seasons it. The human body is a river of time, and these two pay attention to one another’s real bodies, not idealized images of the body. And the body is always seen as animated by a lively, searching and idiosyncratic mind that makes contact with another particular mind through intimate conversation.

Cleopatra is clearly supposed to be attractive, but the play, unlike Shakespeare’s sources, plays down this aspect. It is her complicated personality, full of surprises, to which Shakespeare most draws our attention. (“Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.”) Her mode of seduction is above all mental. “Cunning past men’s thought,” as Antony notes, she ingeniously elaborates a whole battery of stratagems to keep herself in the forefront of his attention: flirtation, capricious annoyance, the constant private teasing, frustrating allusions to significant undelivered information; but also, shared ambition, trusting collaboration, sincere deeply felt admiration for his achievements, insistence on her own equality.

Shakespeare’s teenage lovers seem unaware that every human being has flaws and personal vulnerabilities that real love needs to handle gently and respectfully. Not so our aging lovers. In the scene after the devastating battle of Actium, in which their combined military forces were decisively defeated, Cleopatra displays a delicate attunement to Antony’s self-esteem, intuiting what should and should not be said.

And then there’s Octavia, Antony’s lawful wife, and Cleopatra’s outsize jealousy. Aging love always has baggage. Baggage can be a source of richness; it can be a source of pain. It can be both at the same time. What is certain is that living with a partner’s whole past and present life is a challenge that young lovers typically do not have to face. Facing it well requires many qualities — a sense of one’s own limits, humor, altruism, endurance, humility, self-knowledge — that young lovers have not yet been called upon to develop.

Romeo and Juliet’s love transfigured the world by raising love into the heavens: Juliet is the sun, and, as with the sun, we have no idea what, if anything, makes her laugh. Antony and Cleopatra transfigure the world from within, making each daily experience more vivid, funny and surprising. Without each other, they both feel, the world is sadly boring. “Shall I abide in this dull world,” she asks as he dies, “which in thy absence is no better than a sty?” What’s piggish to her is the absence of interesting conversation. So the world does need to be transfigured by love, but the transfiguration is human and particular, rather than celestial and abstract.

What do we learn from this woman, who, unlike the Marschallin, makes a deep, satisfying and mature choice? We see that mature love is both sexual and personal and that its sexuality is itself personal, based upon memory, humor, shared history. For that reason it has a depth that youthful love can’t have, and that the Marschallin’s vain attempt to find love with a 17-year-old could never deliver. For the Marschallin, love brings neither comedy nor tragedy, only polite resignation. For Antony and Cleopatra, love is comic because of its bodily and temporal particularity. And for that reason it is also tragic, open to huge and irreparable loss.

Lies don’t always endure. Finally, in recent years, Hollywood and television, prodded by a group of extraordinary aging actresses (Helen Mirren, Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton among them) are just beginning to move away from stereotypes and to explore the truths that Shakespeare articulated. But that is a story for another day.

The factory had no rear exit, and many victims were trapped at the back of the building as they tried to escape. Many victims, like Surnah, were burned beyond recognition.

The police are continuing to investigate the fire. The factory owner, the welder and the operations director could face criminal charges, said Fredy Yudha, a police official in Tangerang, where the factory was located.

On the morning of the fire, Surnah’s uncle, Uncin, 21, said he heard an explosion and rushed to the factory, where he joined the police and neighbors in trying to break through the back wall.

They created a hole large enough for three people to escape, he said. But there was no sign of Surnah.

Mr. Uncin said they worked for another half-hour trying to break down the wall and could hear people on the other side calling out.

Then there was a second explosion.

“After that, there were no voices anymore,” he said.

The factory, PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses, was in a poor neighborhood of Tangerang, a city of about two million just west of Jakarta, the capital.

It was built two months ago in an open field near a junior high school, neighbors said.

Surnah and Evih were close friends, their parents said. Evih was inspired to apply for a job at the factory after Surnah started working there, her father said.

The police were able to identify Surnah relatively quickly because of the braces on her teeth. After a DNA comparison with her mother confirmed her identity, they delivered a sealed coffin to the family.

Her funeral was held Saturday. Among the pallbearers was the Tangerang police chief, Harry Kurniawan, whose department is investigating the fire.

While school costs are not exorbitant, many poor families in Indonesia cannot afford to send their children beyond sixth grade.

Surnah lived with her grandparents, an aunt and uncle and a cousin in a one-bedroom house. Her mother, who has remarried, lives with her new husband.

“Surnah said, ‘It is better if I work than if I stay at home and play,’” her mother said. “Surnah said it is better for her to have income herself.”

The factory employed mostly women. Surnah worked in a group of five that had a quota of 1,000 packages a day. If they fell short, their pay would be reduced.

Like Surnah, her friend Evih wanted to be independent and to contribute to her family, her father said.

The Hamar, numbering 45,000 throughout the valley, are known to be pastoralists. The village was overflowing with cattle. As in Dus, the dwellings were simple, built of sticks and grass, and well ordered. Young men tended cattle while a woman skinned and butchered a goat with the help of her toddler, who hung pieces of the animal on a fence beside an AK-47 and a belt of ammo.

“The AK-47 has replaced the spear,” Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Biwa nodded. “As long as you have AK, you are respected,” he said. “Your family feels safe and proud. Someone with no AK, people look down on them. If you do not have AK your family will go to someone who does.”

They were American-made, I was told, gathered during the war in neighboring Sudan.

But they are not cheap,” Mr. Biwa said.

“How much do they cost?” I asked.

“Five cows,” he said.

Beside firearms, I witnessed few other accommodations to the contemporary world in the Omo. Yet for a place so far off the grid, news traveled fast throughout the valley. While in the Hamar village we heard word of a nearby bull-jumping ceremony. The bull jump is a ritual initiation to manhood for both the Hamar and Karo communities. We headed east.

At the end of a long, deeply rutted road we came upon a dusty village in the midst of a celebration. Old men and women gathered in the shade. Young men painted their faces red and white. Young women were draped in skirts and wore large bells wrapped around their calves. Their hair was ornately done in rings caked with ochre-colored mud. Each carried a small horn and blew it incessantly.

When one young woman turned away from me I noticed fresh welts on her bare back, dripping blood; she seemed unaware and continued to dance. Then I saw her approach a young man, stand close in front of him, and blow her horn in his face. She began to jump up and down, her bells clanging, her horn blaring. The young man bent to the ground and picked up a long switch and raised it over his head. The woman blew her horn more insistently, then suddenly stopped. She stared at the young man. He struck her with the whip, which snapped around her body and lashed across her back with a sharp cracking sound. She did not flinch. She lifted her horn, blew it in his face and danced away, fresh blood rising on her back. The same performance was repeated again and again by many of the young women. Their backs were covered in old scars and new welts, yet none of them displayed any outward signs of pain.

As the sun was setting, a dozen bulls were led to a clearing and aligned flank to flank. The women clustered together and began jumping, their bells ringing out, their horns blasting. Others began to chant. Suddenly a naked young man leapt up on the back of the first bull and raced across the spine of each. He jumped down after the last bull, but then he was up again, racing across their backs in the other direction. He repeated the back-and-forth exercise three times. If he fell it would be a disgrace he would carry for life, Mr. Biwa had warned me. But the youth never faltered — the next morning he would awake a man, able to sit among the elders.

The women continued to blow their horns and the celebration continued on into the night. We drove away under a moonless sky, the Southern Cross hanging low, silence filling our car.

The next morning we headed up river to a small village of the Nyangatom people. Relations between Karo and Nyangatom have long been strained. Intertribal conflicts over cattle rustling and grazing land have kept the valley bristling with internal strife for decades, passed down from generation to generation, Mr. Biwa said.

“Where we are going, this was our land until 15 years ago,” Mr. Biwa said as he throttled our engine through the brown water. “The Nyangatom are fierce fighters. They pushed us across the river. Our women tell us we are weak. Not just with their words. They dance — in front of everyone. It is a shame we wear.”

We passed large crocodiles cooling themselves on the muddy banks, their jaws resting open. Black-and-white colobus monkeys leapt from branches of fig trees. A dugout canoe sat unattended on the riverbank. A Goliath heron lumbered into the air.

In time the heavy foliage lining the river thinned, then grew sparse. Thirty-foot cliffs began to rise up and the landscape turned parched. Ahead, on the west bank, bony cattle were drinking from the river, kicking a choking dust high into the sky and across the sun, casting everything in an eerie patina. Atop the cliff, two men stood sentry. One had an AK-47 slung from his shoulder; the other wore what in a more urban setting might have been called a hipster hat. The tribes wore a mishmash of clothing — brightly colored traditional wraps, animal skins and adornments, mixed freely with Chelsea football jerseys, rakish caps and fatigue shorts — creating an all too apt picture of Africa’s disparate influences, all vying for dominance.

The men on the cliff greeted us with stares, and we set out across the arid land. Distant hills of Kenya were visible to the south. Three young girls with water jugs balancing on their heads silently caught up with us. One carried the designs of scarification — small, raised scars created by rubbing charcoal in deliberately administered cuts, causing the skin to welt in intricate patterns. They made this two-mile walk to and from the river twice daily — in Africa carrying water is women’s work.

At the outskirts of the village, a half-dozen expressionless men loitered. The tallest sported a vaguely military-looking beret, worn at a jaunty angle, and an AK-47. The rest held long sticks. Some wore rubber sandals made from scavenged truck ties; the others were barefoot.

Many Nyangatom are seminomadic and this village appeared haphazardly thrown together, as if built in a rush, without care. There was no central meeting area, no sense of organization. Children did not rush to greet us. We huddled with the men in the scant shade of a scraggly date tree. Cigarettes were passed around and smoked.

Photo

In time, more than a dozen women emerged from the honeycomb-shaped dwellings that looked as if they could neither contain nor shelter life. One old woman began to chant, then just as suddenly stopped. All wore heavy ropes of beaded necklaces piled high and were wrapped from the waist in once colorful cloth, and several held small children. Fatigue hung in the blistering heat. It would have been difficult to imagine daily life clinging closer to the edge of existence.

“The cradle of mankind is no Garden of Eden,” Mr. Jones said softly as we tracked back cross the barren land to the boat.

Back down the river, the mood was more celebratory — a ceremony was underway in Dus. Two hundred men from Mr. Biwa’s Karo community were gathering in a large semicircle on a bluff above the river. Seating was arranged from the youngest to the most senior elder. I was offered a spot in the dirt much too far along the timeline for my liking.

A bull was being roasted over an open fire in the center of the gathering. Three men with machetes hacked the animal to pieces. Chunks of meat and fat, clinging to large bones, were deposited onto small beds of leaves before the assembled. A part of the animal I couldn’t identify was dropped in front of me. The old man beside me with heavily pierced ears and a pointed stick protruding below his lower lip offered me his knife. He watched as I sliced into the mysterious blob, then grinned as I put it in my mouth. Just beyond the circle a dozen hooded vultures gathered.

When the entire animal had been consumed, one of the elders got up and began to speak.

For Facebook and Google, the discovery of Russian influence by way of their sites has been a rude awakening.
The company said it planned to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.","The Russia-linked posts were “an insidious attempt to drive people apart,” Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook who will appear at the hearings, said in his prepared remarks. He called the posts “deeply disturbing,” and noted they focused on race, religion, gun rights, and gay and transgender issues, in attempts to spread discord among Americans.

Facebook, Mr. Stretch said, was “determined to prevent it from happening again.”

The new information also illuminated when Facebook knew that there had been Russian interference on its platform. Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations.

Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users’ News Feeds everyday. Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook.

Google, in a prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria. This replicated the efforts found on Twitter and Facebook to foment societal division with hot-button topics.

Google said it had found 18 channels that were “likely associated” with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube. All told, those accounts — now suspended — uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017. Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts; only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers.

The internet search giant also confirmed earlier reports that the Internet Research Agency had purchased search and display ads from it. Google said the group had bought $4,700 in ads but none of them had targeted users by their political leanings, which was a targeting tool that Google added before the election.

Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those had not been related to the Kremlin.

“While we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable,” wrote Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel. The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.

For Facebook and Google, the discovery of Russian influence by way of their sites has been a rude awakening. The companies had long positioned themselves as spreading information and connecting people for positive ends. Now the companies must grapple with how Russian agents used their technologies exactly as they were meant to be used — but for malevolent purposes.

That has led to thorny debates inside the companies. For Facebook, the problem is less straightforward than finding Russia-linked pages and taking down content. Executives worry about how stifling speech from non-American entities could set a precedent on the social network — and how it could potentially be used against other groups in the future.

So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity — or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such — as a reason for taking down the accounts.

“Many of these ads did not violate our content policies,” Elliot Schrage, vice president of policy and communications at Facebook, said in a company blog post earlier this month. “That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.”

Earlier this month, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner introduced a bipartisan bill to require internet companies to identify those who paid for political ads on the tech companies’ platforms.

Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill. Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network.

The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures. Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate. The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year.

Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads. The company said it planned to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.

The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Google’s AdWords — for example, web search ads — and YouTube. Google also said it will identify the advertisers paying for political advertisements within a link accessible from the ad.

But Google said it planned on taking no further action against state-backed Russian news channel RT, which has built a massive online audience through YouTube. The American intelligence community has described RT as the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet”, but Google said the organization had not violated any of its policies or misused the service.

Last week, by contrast, Twitter said it would ban RT and Sputnik, another Kremlin-backed news organization, from advertising on its service.",Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Even if the new coalition can best Negan and begin the long process of restoring order, the world it inherits may not be worth the struggle it took to win.

The concluding note, when Morales cocks his gun with Rick in the cross hairs, may be necessary for the episode’s statement on the hazards of pity. But that doesn’t change how narratively unsatisfying it is. The writers have fallen back on bad habits, toying with the viewership’s trust and eroding its patience. Morgan gets shot and collapses to the ground, only to wake up seemingly unharmed moments later. The scene is shot in such a way as to imply that he’s dead, which makes the revelation that he isn’t feel a bit crass. It’s a classic boy-who-cried wolf scenario; after casually pseudo-killing and reviving Morgan for no other reason than sheer kicks, the writers can’t expect the audience to take Eric’s apparent death seriously.

The bitter ground war with Negan has only begun, and with Maggie and Rick at ideological odds about their plan of attack, more characters are bound for reckonings with their moral limits. It’s in their best interest — and the show’s — to do so quickly and move forward under a single banner. Negan’s great strength comes from his dictatorial rule, having the full allegiance of his disposable grunts; if the heroes assembled hope to stand a chance against their foe, they’ll have to reconcile some deep-seated differences and form a united front.

A Few Thoughts While We Survey the Wreckage

• The episode begins and ends with a lugubrious montage of facial close-ups for our assorted heroes. These sequences prove ineffective and non-affecting as bookends, as artistically blank the first time as the second.

• Harnessed as weapons by Negan’s crew, the zombies continue to saunter farther away from relevancy this season. Once the primary antagonists, they’ve now been reduced to a substitute for water, forming a “moat” in a fenced-in perimeter around the Savior compound. Outgrowing its fundamental premise has been the main factor in the growing pains this series has experienced over the past few seasons.

• We last saw Gabriel in dire straits, trapped with Negan, doom all but certain. He makes no appearance whatsoever in this week’s episode, which would seem to suggest the worst, but Negan is conspicuously absent as well. Perhaps next week will provide resolution for them both, and even upend the grim assumptions about the character’s fate that his last sighting invited.

• The count of C.G.I. tiger maulings currently stands at one, an auspicious start to what we can only hope will be the most tiger-maulingest season yet.","‘The Walking Dead’ Season 8, Episode 2: The Hazards of Pity",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/arts/television/the-walking-dead-recap-the-damned.html

I am a man. Six-foot-two, 200 lbs. Able-bodied, and physically fit. I move through the world with the privilege of never even considering the idea of being sexually assaulted or harassed. (Men are also sexually assaulted and raped, but the scale of those occurrences is dwarfed by scale of those problems for women.)

This is one of my male privileges, and I have to check it.

More important, I must follow the advice on sexism that I proffer on racism: If you are not actively working to dismantle it, you are supporting it. It is not sufficient to simply not be a sexist yourself if you are a man. You must also recognize that you benefit from the system of sexism in ways to which you may not even be aware.

Every man must become a feminist. Every man must work as hard as every woman to elevate gender equality and to eliminate gendered violence.

And yes, I understand how hard this can be. Constant outrage is exhausting, even about your own oppression. I am a black man in America. I’m worn threadbare dealing with the oppressions that men who look like me endure, from racially skewed mass incarceration to being the targets of police violence.

I understand that all oppressions are, in some way, intersectional and connected to all other violence, that the empathic connections of ally-ship are multidirectional and reciprocal.

And yet, it remains a stubborn fact that it is hard to stay fully immersed in another person’s pain. No matter how many times you hear them talk about their struggle, and even when you feel deeply moved by their expression of it, unless you have experienced that same pain yourself, a gap remains.

This is a very human limitation, even for the egalitarian and well intentioned. Keeping someone else’s struggle and strife top of mind is hard to do.

But acknowledging this deficiency — to yourself and to others — is a healthy and helpful first step. There is no magical solution here for the infinite and permanent expansion of empathy and awareness. It is work: hard work.

We have to stop, listen and receive other people’s experiences, validate those experiences and honor the feeling with which they are expressed. And we have to center the speaker and not the listener, center the person who lacks the privilege and not the one who possesses it.

I can’t know what women experience in this country and indeed in this world — not on a gut level or an experiential level — but I can learn the facts of those experiences. I can be eager to listen. I can advocate for cultural and policy changes that would make women’s lives better. And, I can forgive myself, I believe, for being shocked and saddened when something that I deeply understand intellectually is illustrated in ways that make me deeply understand it emotionally.

When I was in college, there was a popular T-shirt that read, “It’s a black thing, you wouldn’t understand.” I never bought one because I disagreed. Others may not be able to fully know your plight as a lived experience, but they can absolutely be made to understand, particularly if they have an earnest desire to do so.

Ultimately, the plan would be likely to hurt the finances of the vast majority of Americans. No wonder it is starting to look politically vulnerable. Last week, a precursor bill barely passed the House, receiving 20 no votes from Republicans, many worried about the tax increases.

Republican leaders certainly have a path to passing a tax bill, because nothing unites modern Republicans the way a tax cut does. But the opposition to the recent health care bills also started as an underdog and managed to prevail, by relentlessly talking about the bills’ effects. When enough Americans understood the truth, enough members of Congress felt pressure to vote no.

The same could happen on taxes. It is already starting to. Recent polls suggest the plan’s approval rating is only about 30 percent.

To understand the Trump tax increases, you should first acknowledge the most admirable feature of his plan. It doesn’t aspire to be merely a tax cut. It aspires to be tax reform — both cuts and increases. Some deductions shrink, while rates fall, in the name of simplifying the tax code.

But after this promising start, the plan commits its cardinal sin. It places the highest priority on huge tax cuts for the very wealthy. They get lower rates and get to keep cherished tax breaks, like the “carried interest” loophole. Herbert Hoover’s Republican Party wanted to put a chicken in every pot. Donald Trump’s wants to put a yacht at every private dock.

Having lavished so much money on the wealthy, the tax package — or at least the vague framework that the administration has released — doesn’t have much remaining to spend on middle class and poor families. For them, the package is a mix of pluses and minuses. Many face a lower tax rate, but some face a higher one, and many families lose deductions.

The combination creates a lot of losers. Reduced deductions for children, for example, hurt large families, notes N.Y.U.’s Lily Batchelder. And the deduction for state and local taxes — also a target for cuts — now benefits 30 percent of households nationwide. It was the main reason for last week’s House defections, and the tensions over it haven’t been resolved.

Then there are the long-term problems I mentioned earlier. First, Trump’s plan takes a skimpy approach to inflation adjustments, which will push many families into higher tax brackets over time. Second, the plan would radically increase the federal deficit, and when it comes to the deficit, what goes up must eventually come down. At some point, the government will need to pay its bills, through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.

Virtually any future deficit-reduction plan — except for a repeal of the Trump tax plan — would hurt most families more than his plan helps them. This chain of events has happened before. The Reagan and George W. Bush tax cuts may have at first seemed to help the middle class and poor. But the deficits led to later cuts in education, medical research, transportation and anti-poverty programs that almost surely erased the benefits of a modest tax cut. Already, today’s congressional leaders are talking about sizable cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.

Trump and his allies are feverishly trying to claim their plan really would benefit the middle class. Their latest talking point is the notion that corporate tax cuts will create an indirect windfall for workers. Funny, though, how the wealthy get most of the direct benefits, while everyone else has to hope for indirect ones somehow to materialize.

Asked about the possibility of a pardon for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Trump, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said: “I haven’t had any conversations with him about that. I think we should let the process play through before we start looking at those steps.”

The New York investigations focus in part on Mr. Manafort’s relationship with the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, a small lender that provided him some big loans. The bank, which received a subpoena but is not itself under investigation, is led by Stephen M. Calk, a onetime economic adviser to Mr. Trump.

Mr. Vance’s office is questioning whether Mr. Manafort misled the bank when applying for the loans, the people briefed on the investigation said, a previously unreported development that hews closely to the federal indictment announced on Monday. In examining the loan documents, Mr. Vance’s office is seeking to determine whether Mr. Manafort used the loan money for an unauthorized purpose, which could amount to filing a false business record, a crime in New York State.

The New York prosecutors are also seeking to trace cash that Mr. Manafort moved in and out of American bank accounts, partly to verify whether he paid state taxes on income earned overseas, the people said. Investigators working for the New York prosecutors have obtained documents suggesting that at least some of the money came from a bank in Cyprus, the Mediterranean nation considered a tax haven and a magnet for Russian money.

This is another area of inquiry that overlaps with Mr. Mueller’s case, a 12-count indictment that accused Mr. Manafort and a business partner of conspiracy to launder money from accounts in Cyprus and elsewhere.

The overlap will most likely mean that Mr. Mueller’s case will take priority over Mr. Vance’s and Mr. Schneiderman’s.

And while Mr. Vance’s office is continuing to investigate Mr. Manafort, Mr. Schneiderman has deferred his inquiry into the former Trump campaign chairman, at least temporarily, so as to not interfere with the federal case, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. Mr. Schneiderman would most likely resume his investigation if Mr. Manafort received a presidential pardon, the person said.

This year, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported the existence of Mr. Vance’s investigation and his subpoena of the Chicago bank, while The New York Times and others have reported Mr. Manafort’s extensive financial ties to Cyprus and Mr. Calk’s relationship with the Trump campaign.

The status of Mr. Schneiderman’s investigation, and the focus of Mr. Vance’s, were not previously known. A spokeswoman for Mr. Vance declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman.

Mr. Schneiderman has clashed with Mr. Trump or his associates on a number of occasions. He sued the Trump administration to preserve an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, and he sued Trump University, contending that it used high-pressure sales tactics and false claims to woo students. Mr. Trump settled the case after winning the election.

Mr. Trump has called Mr. Schneiderman a “lightweight,” but Mr. Schneiderman has denied that politics play any role in his investigations.

“I think we’ve got an extraordinary record of having gone after many, many Democrats since I’ve been in office,” he said in an interview with MSNBC in September.

Prosecutors were not the first to call attention to Mr. Manafort’s New York real estate dealings. Those transactions came to light on a blog, 377union.com, written by two New York lawyers who used public mortgage documents to piece together Mr. Manafort’s real estate transactions, some of which now appear in the federal charges against Mr. Manafort.

Over the last several years, the blog noted, limited liability companies linked to Mr. Manafort bought residential properties using cash, only to later take out big loans using the properties as part of the collateral. Initially, the loans came from big banks, but by late 2016, Mr. Manafort turned to the Federal Savings Bank in Chicago.

In November, the Chicago bank provided a $9.5 million loan to Summerbreeze L.L.C., a shell company tied to Mr. Manafort, using a home in the Hamptons as collateral, The Times previously reported. Two months later, the bank provided another two mortgages, totaling about $6.5 million, for a brownstone that Mr. Manafort owns in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn.

These were no small loans for Federal Savings, which typically focuses on affordable mortgages for military veterans. Mr. Manafort’s loans amounted to about 5.4 percent of the bank’s total assets, according to public reports.

Publicly filed documents classified the Brooklyn mortgages as a “building loan” and a “project loan,” the type of mortgages that owners generally can use to upgrade their properties. Mr. Vance’s office is questioning whether Mr. Manafort actually used the money for repairs to the Brooklyn property, or if he misrepresented the purpose of the loans and instead spent it on repaying other debts, the people briefed on the investigation said.

The loans from the Chicago bank arrived when Mr. Manafort was digging out from foreclosure proceedings that another lender, Genesis Capital, filed on the Brooklyn property, court records show. One of the loans from the Chicago bank was for $5.3 million, the same amount of money that Genesis pledged to lend before filing for foreclosure.

Mr. Manafort has also indicated that he was taking out loans at that time to salvage property investments he made in California with his son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai, whose real estate business filed for bankruptcy. In an affidavit filed in the bankruptcy case, Mr. Manafort said he had decided to “assist with additional funding to protect my existing investments.”

It is unclear whether Mr. Manafort used some of the loan money from the Chicago bank for that purpose. Mr. Yohai’s investment activities are separately under investigation by Mr. Schneiderman’s office.

In questioning whether Mr. Manafort misled his lenders, the New York authorities are stepping into an area of focus for Mr. Mueller. Mr. Manafort, the federal indictment said, bought multimillion-dollar properties in the United States, and then borrowed millions more against the homes, “thereby obtaining cash in the United States without reporting and paying taxes on the income.” The indictment added that “in order to increase the amount of money he could access in the United States,” Mr. Manafort “defrauded the institutions that loaned money.”

The indictment did not specify the lenders; however, it refers to a loan on the Brooklyn property that matches the time in early 2016 — and dollar amount — of the loan that Genesis Capital provided Mr. Manafort. The indictment notes that “after promising the bank” that part of the money “would be used solely for construction,” Mr. Manafort instead diverted some of it to making a down payment on another property in California.

Like Mr. Mueller, Mr. Vance and Mr. Schneiderman also examined the flow of money in and out of Mr. Manafort’s bank accounts in the United States — and so far, they have traced some of that cash to accounts in Cyprus, the people briefed on the investigations said. It is unclear whether he paid New York State taxes on that income.

Mr. Mueller’s charges outline a similar scheme involving Cyprus accounts, alleging that all of the money that Mr. Manafort used to originally buy the Brooklyn property came from an entity in Cyprus. Mr. Manafort, the indictment also said, “funneled millions of dollars in payments” that he had earned from Ukranian clients into companies and bank accounts based in foreign countries such as Cyprus. Mr. Manafort then “used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income.”",Investigations of Manafort in New York Are Beyond Trump’s Power to Pardon,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/business/trump-manafort-pardon-new-york-state-vance.html

Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner, apologized Sunday night for what he said “would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior” after the actor Anthony Rapp made an accusation about his sexual conduct with him 31 years ago, when Mr. Rapp was 14 years old.

Mr. Spacey, who has long been fiercely private about his personal life, said in a statement that he did not remember any such encounter, but added that Mr. Rapp’s accusation “has encouraged me to address other things about my life.” He then disclosed that he had “loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man.”

The rapid cycle of accusation and apology began Sunday evening, when BuzzFeed published an article in which Mr. Rapp alleged that Mr. Spacey “was trying to get with me sexually” after a party at Mr. Spacey’s apartment in 1986. After all the other guests had left, Mr. Rapp said that Mr. Spacey, who appeared intoxicated, “picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don’t, like, squirm away initially, because I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ And then he lays down on top of me.”

Mr. Rapp, who is best known for playing the character Mark Cohen in the original Broadway production of “Rent,” confirmed the contents of the article and said he had decided to speak out at a time when several women have accused the producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault.

“I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out, to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me,” Mr. Rapp said in an emailed statement. “Everything I wanted to say about my experience is in that article, and I have no further comment about it at this time.”

His statements constitute yet another troubling quantum of evidence that the Trump campaign may have known about and encouraged the Russian intrusion on our elections — so-called collusion.","Just hours after the revelation of federal indictments against President Trump’s former campaign chairman and chief strategist, Paul Manafort, and his former campaign deputy, Rick Gates, the administration’s first response came in the form, of course, of a tweet from the president: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”

Expect to hear this line repeatedly from the president and his defenders: The indictments, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy, are a vindication of President Trump because he was not charged and because of the absence of allegations about campaign collusion with Russia. But they’re wrong — the president should be very worried.

For one thing, it is now clear that President Trump closely relied upon Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates while they were engaged in alleged criminal activity. That is a damning indictment of the president’s judgment. Their prosecution will hang over him and his administration for the foreseeable future, since these proceedings will continue for many months, and perhaps years. And these are unlikely to be the last of the charges pursued by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, who is also reported to be looking at other actors, including the president himself.

The idea that Mr. Manafort’s indictment vindicates Mr. Trump also ignores how complex criminal investigations typically proceed, and the attendant peril Mr. Trump now faces. In our half century of collective experience prosecuting and defending criminal cases, we have watched repeatedly as prosecutors charged lower-level individuals with readily provable offenses that are distinct from the core conduct and targets that are the primary focus of the prosecutor’s investigation.

It’s also significant that Mr. Mueller threw the book at Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates. Because the federal sentencing guidelines recommend a significant prison sentence for money-laundering offenses and are largely driven by the dollar amounts involved in the crime, this indictment, which involves millions of dollars, puts tremendous pressure on them to make a cooperation deal with the special counsel’s office to try to reduce the lengthy prison sentences each could face.

The power of this “squeeze play” approach is demonstrated by the other filing released today, reflecting a guilty plea by George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser who admits to communications with foreign individuals during the campaign, including at least one about the Russians’ possessing “dirt” concerning Hillary Clinton “in the form of ‘thousands of emails.’ ” Mr. Papadopoulos lied about these engagements when questioned, and was caught doing so.

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

Health experts widely agree that most of us should sit less, especially at work. Prolonged sitting has been linked with higher risks for diabetes and heart disease, among other conditions. While treadmill and standing desks have grown in popularity, they provide a clear impact on our health but perhaps not on our work itself. We know that most people type better when they sit still than when they stand up or move about. But do they also think better?

Most studies of prolonged sitting have looked at the benefits from breaking up sitting time on blood sugar and blood pressure. For an innovative new study published recently in The Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, researchers at Arizona State University in Phoenix recruited nine sedentary, overweight men and women and asked them to show up at a simulated office space at the university.

During one visit, the volunteers sat continuously for eight hours (apart from bathroom breaks), while using a computer and talking on the phone, as if it were any workday. Twice during the day, they also completed computerized measures of many thinking skills, including working memory and decision making.

Then, during three other faux workdays, the volunteers broke up their sitting time by variously standing, walking at a treadmill desk or pedaling a modified stationary bicycle placed beneath their desks for at least 10 minutes once an hour. The exercise was gentle — a walking pace of one mile per hour or comparable effort while pedaling — and the volunteers typed and chatted during these breaks. They also repeated the tests of thinking twice each day, immediately after standing or exercising.

The researchers had wondered whether standing or exercising might impair the ability to concentrate and think, much as it did with typing proficiency, says Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise and health promotion at Arizona State who oversaw the study.

While virtual-reality pornography may feel like something out of a science fiction movie, it already has a formidable, if underground, presence. According to website Pornhub, views of VR porn are up 275 percent since it debuted in the summer of 2016. Now the site is averaging about 500,000 views (on Christmas Day in 2016, this number shot up to 900,000.)

By 2025 pornography will be the third-largest VR sector, according to estimates prepared by Piper Jaffray, an investment and management firm. Only video games and N.F.L.-related content will be larger, it predicted, and the market will be worth $1 billion.

“We’re getting more and more of it every day,” said Mark Kernes, a senior editor at AVN Media Network, which covers the industry. “We are leading the technology in this area. Sex sells, and where there is money to be made, there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it,” some by offering it for free to increase clicks.

Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press, and spurred developments in the internet, online payment systems and other technology. Now it’s time for virtual reality, Mr. Kernes said: “I’m pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.”

Headsets Are Just the Beginning

Ms. Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3, a conference for the video-game industry. Excited by the pornography possibilities, she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star. Before long, Ms. Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles.

She was one of the first VR webcam women, according to Mr. Kernes. She then started a company named VRTube.xxx, which now employs over 40 performers.

Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate, considering the potential for abuse, disease and exploitation, the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues. For example, can you use someone’s likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality?

“Virtual reality is like the Wild Wild West,” said Bryony Cole, the host of “Future of Sex,” a podcast that explores technology and sexuality.

At this year’s AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas, the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display.

CamSoda, a website that specializes in live sex videos, had an exhibit featuring pornography stars dressed in plunging bathing suits and waving visitors into the booth. They were showing off OhRama, a small canister that attaches to virtual reality headsets and releases scent during the action. “Believe it or not, the scents were created by the girls,” said Mr. Kernes, who was there. “It’s sweet and musty. They know what they like.”

There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience.

Another big player is CamasutraVR, a start-up using 142 cameras that all look at one person, or one body part. “They are creating images from that, which they are hoping will be indistinguishable from an actual person,” Mr. Kernes said. “I’m sure those people wished they had been using that VR system at home.”

Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material. “As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator,” he said.

One of the most buzzed-about inventions has been the sex robot. The first one, Harmony, was introduced in May by a company named Realbotix. In seductive videos posted on YouTube, Harmony shows off her long legs, her firm breasts, her full lips, her lifelike hand gestures, even her intellect.

“How do you feel about sex?” an unknown presenter asks her in one video.

“Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world,” she responds in a raspy voice. “I don’t see anything wrong with it.” Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space; she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching.

“It’s a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi,” said Matt McMullen, the C.E.O. and creative director of Realbotix. The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality. “Based on our experiences with thousands of clients,” Mr. McMullen said, “people do use them for sex, but there is something more that exists. We focus on companionship.”

Virtual reality has been nicknamed the empathy machine because it allows people to feel like they are truly connected to the action. “It’s neurological,” said Holly Richmond, a somatic psychologist based in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. “You aren’t just watching and thinking about it. You are feeling it, and it’s not just your genitals. There is literally a mind-body connection.”

When Ms. Darling does live X-rated performances, users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen. “The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off,” she said. “They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.”

Many sex therapists and educators are interested in the new technology, just as a dentist might be with the latest plaque-detection gizmos. Ms. Richmond worked with BaDoinkVR, a virtual-reality company in Rochester, N.Y., to create Virtual Sexology, a series of free videos that help men and women overcome common sex problems.

A recent video, updated in June, takes women into the bedroom where they see how one blond, busty woman arouses herself before sex. She sits in front of her partner massaging her arms, her legs, her breasts. As her breathing heats up, a voice-over says that some women need to be physically touched before feeling any desire for sex. The first video, aimed at men, was the most downloaded video on BaDoinkVR.com in 2016 — an impressive feat considering it was competing with noneducational pornography.

Ms. Cole, the podcast host, is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education.

“What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?” she said. “Or they can be in a room with someone who said, ‘I contacted herpes and this is my experience.’ That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.”

Indeed.

Barbara Rothbaum, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emory’s Veterans Program, is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma.

The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks, tents, private living quarters, latrines, offices or remote buildings and vehicles, where the trauma may have taken place. The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace.

But for virtual reality to work, the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality. They have to feel like they are participants, not just observers. “We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them,” Ms. Cole said. As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen, issues are bound to arise.

Mr. McCullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize. His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used.

Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire. “What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?” she said. “What does consent mean in virtual reality? Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldn’t do in real life? If you are using someone’s likeness in virtual reality, do you require their permission? And what about revenge porn? That will be even harsher in virtual reality.”

She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps, drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters.

Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating. It is, after all, much more lifelike than traditional pornography.

But Mr. McCullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that, but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation, not causing it. “There are people who are already lonely, and people who live their lives being alone. They work all day and come home to an empty house,” he said. “This is just offering an alternative to those types of people. They don’t have anyone else.”",Virtual Reality Gets Naughty,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/style/virtual-reality-porn.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The Democrats are undergoing a historic transformation, from being the party that embraced neoliberalism in the early 1990s to one that is rejecting that centrist posture and moving left. There’s plenty about this to cheer — the neoliberal Democratic Party didn’t do nearly enough to try to arrest growing income inequality, among other shortcomings.

There will be necessary internecine fights, and they boil down to loyalty tests on particular positions demanded by the vanguard. Consider the debate within the party on Senator Bernie Sanders’s “Medicare for All” bill, which most (though not all) 2020 contenders rushed to attach themselves to. To fail to sign on to that legislation is to open oneself to criticism, even abuse, although it’s less a piece of legislation than a goal.

Forget about who’s right and wrong in these debates. Time will sort that out. My point is that they tend to consume a party experiencing a shift. The Democratic Party, because it is an amalgam of interest groups in a way the Republican Party is not, has always had a tendency to elevate the candidate who can check the most boxes. The current internal dynamics exacerbate that. It’s also worth remembering that no one besides party activists cares.

So when the party’s leaders tussle over this or that policy, they also need to take a step back, to see the direction the country — the West itself — is heading, and take a stand on it. This isn’t just a matter of high-minded idealism; it’s what separates great politicians from merely good ones.

History tells us that the transformative politicians, the ones who can change the country’s direction and will really matter in the history books, are the ones who can do both. I think there have been four of them in the past century: Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Why Roosevelt and Reagan should be obvious. I know some would dispute my choice of Mr. Clinton, but he rescued a party that had lost three presidential elections in a row and was being read last rites by some pundits in 1991 (the extent to which he changed the country’s fundamental direction is debatable). Mr. Obama made history and redrew the electoral map. All four were able to speak both to their base and beyond it by identifying the challenge of the moment and persuading majorities that they had some answers.

The future of the Western democratic project is the fundamental issue of our era. It’s under attack from Vladimir Putin and Steve Bannon and many people in between (and to the extent that he backs Mr. Bannon’s purge of the Republican Party, from the president himself; think about that).

Democrats can’t duck this question and expect the broader electorate to see them as prepared to lead. To his credit, Mr. Sanders did talk a bit about all this in a foreign-policy speech in late September at the same Missouri college where Winston Churchill gave his Iron Curtain speech, noting an “international order” that is “under great strain.”

The key to finding the blue bird of happiness was education, and the sacred center of Soviet education was Alexander Pushkin. “We spoke of Pushkin as if he were alive,” wrote Lydia Libedinskaia, who attended the Moscow Exemplаry School in the 1930s. “We kept asking each other if Pushkin would like our metro, our new bridges that spanned the Moskva, the neon lights on Gorky Street.”

After ushering in the New Year of 1937, the 16-year-old Libedinskaia and her friends went to the Pushkin Monument in the center of Moscow. According to her memoirs, they gathered around Pushkin’s statue and took turns “reading his poems to him — one after another, on and on.”

Suddenly, in the frosty silence of that New Year’s Eve, a boy’s voice, trembling with excitement, rang out: While freedom kindles us, my friend, While honor calls us and we hear it, Come, to our country let us tend The noble promptings of the spirit. It sounded like a vow. That is how, in solemn silence, warriors take their oaths. Happy are those who had such moments in their youth ... The snow kept falling, melting on our flushed faces and silvering our hair. Our hearts were overflowing with love for Pushkin, poetry, Moscow, and our country. We yearned for great deeds and vowed silently to accomplish them. My generation! The children of the 1920s, the men and women of a happy and tragic age! You grew up as equal participants in the building of the Soviet Union, you were proud of your fathers, who had carried out an unheard-of revolution, you dreamed of becoming their worthy successors ...

Many of these boys and girls would be killed during World War II, better known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War. Some would be arrested and sent into exile. Some, like Libedinskaia, would go on to welcome Khrushchev’s thaw and then Gorbachev’s Perestroika. Most would continue to be proud of their fathers. None would consider themselves their spiritual successors.

Bolshevism — and Marxism in general — had a remarkably flat conception of human nature: A revolution in property relations was the only necessary condition for a revolution in human hearts. The dictatorship of the proletariat would automatically result in the withering away of whatever got in the way of Communism, from the state to the family. Accordingly, the Bolsheviks never worried much about the family, never policed the home, and never connected the domestic rites of passage — childbirth, marriage and death — to their sociology and political economy.

No one knew what a good Communist home was supposed to look like, and no one came to check whether Nina Avgustovna Didrikil and her husband, the commander of the assault on the Winter Palace and later president of Red Sports International, Nikolai Ilyich Podvoisky, were reading Marx, Engels and Lenin to their children. They were not, and they were not expected to. They were reading Goethe, Heine and Tolstoy instead.

Most millenarian sects that survive the death of the first generation of believers are those that preserve the hope of salvation by maintaining a strict separation — physical, ritual and intellectual — from the outside world. The Bolsheviks, secure in their economic determinism, assumed that the outside world would join them as a matter of course, and embraced non-Communist art and literature as both prologue and accompaniment to their own. Even at the height of fear and suspicion, when anyone connected to the outside world might be subject to sacrificial murder, Soviet readers were expected to learn from Dante, Shakespeare and Cervantes.

The children of the Bolshevik millenarians never read Marx, Engels or Lenin at home, and, after the educational system was rebuilt around Pushkin, Soviet children stopped reading them in school, too. At home, the children of the Bolsheviks read what they called the “treasures of world literature,” with an emphasis on the Golden Ages analogous to their own (the Renaissance, Romanticism and the realist novel, especially Balzac, Dickens and Tolstoy).

What most of these books had in common was their anti-millenarian humanism. Some particular favorites, including “A Tale of Two Cities” and Anatole France’s “The Gods Are Athirst,” were expressly anti-revolutionary; most did the opposite of what the Bolsheviks preached by embracing the folly and pathos of human existence. The point of the golden ages, as opposed to the silver ones and any number of modernisms, is the affirmation of “really existing” humanity.

The books proclaimed as models at the First Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934 and imbibed religiously by the children of the original Bolsheviks were profoundly anti-Bolshevik, none more so than the one routinely described as the best of them all: Tolstoy’s “War and Peace.” All rules, plans, grand theories and historical explanations were vanity, stupidity or deception. Natasha Rostova, Tolstoy’s protagonist, “did not deign to be intelligent.” The meaning of life was in living it.

Something else all those books had in common was that they were “historical” in the sense of being self-consciously concerned with the passing of time and with the past as a foreign country. The children of the Revolution did not only live in the past — they loved it for being the past and, like most readers and writers of historical fiction, tended to focus on lost causes: Scott’s Scots, Boussenard’s Boers, Cooper’s Mohicans, Sienkiewicz’s Poles, Mayne Reid’s Seminoles, Mérimée’s Corsicans, Pushkin’s Pugachev, Gogol’s Taras Bulba, Stendhal’s Napoleon and everything Dumas’s Musketeers pledged to preserve, from Her Majesty’s honor to the head of Charles I.

Even the great socialist classics, Raffaello Giovagnoli’s “Spartacus” and Ethel Voynich’s “The Gadfly,” were about Romantic self-sacrifice. And, of course, no one doubted that the greatest of them all was the one that focused on the most hopeless of lost causes: the pursuit of historical causality. Tolstoy did not deign to be intelligent.

Revolutions do not devour their children; revolutions, like all millenarian experiments, are devoured by the children of the revolutionaries. The Bolsheviks, who did not fear the past and who employed God-fearing peasant nannies to bring up their children, were particularly proficient in creating their own gravediggers.

The parents had their faith; the children had their tastes and knowledge. The parents had comrades (fellow saints who shared their faith); the children had friends (pseudo-kin who shared their tastes and knowledge). The parents started out as sectarians and ended up as priestly rulers or sacred scapegoats; the children started out as poets and ended up as professionals and intellectuals. The parents considered their sectarianism the realization of humanism — until their interrogators forced them to choose, and to die, one way or the other. The children never knew anything but humanism and never understood their parents’ final dilemma.

“In my family, you have to get the curtains right away. You can’t have people looking in at you. Maybe it’s a Southern thing,” said Ms. Mathis, whose mother was raised in North Carolina.

Several months later, she bought a dining set. Several months after that, they got a couch. But if the rent was a stretch, it was worthwhile. She loved the hardwood floors and the dining room, which is divided from the living room by pocket doors. And the building felt like home, with her mother across the hall and her aunt living upstairs.

So did the neighborhood. “I see faces that I grew up around,” Ms. Mathis said.

The only thing she lacked was a lease, but over the next decade the rent never went up. Then, in late 2014, the building sold to new owners, Mendel and Chananya Gold, who offered tenants buyouts to get them to leave. Those who stayed endured months of construction as the other apartments were renovated.

Name: Lisa Mathis Age: 57 Occupation: Court clerk specialist in New York State Surrogate’s Court, where she runs the administration department.Rent: Formerly $1,200 a month, which Ms. Mathis learned was more than the legally allowable rent when she discovered the unit was rent stabilized. After reaching a settlement with the landlord addressing the overcharges, Ms. Mathis now pays less, but said she was not at liberty to disclose the terms.The cost of living Brooklyn in the 1960s and 70s: “When I was growing up, Manhattan was expensive. We talked about, ‘Oh, you’d have to live up in Harlem to afford it.’ But in Brooklyn, it used to be that you could always find a place. It might not be the poshest place, but you could find one.” On the changes in Crown Heights: “There have been changes for the better, and that’s good, but not when you’re pushing people out.”Getting to know the neighbors: Ms. Mathis said that the hardship in the building has brought the tenants closer. “The first winter, a gentleman from upstairs knocked on my door with hand warmers. He said, ‘Do you need a space heater?’”

Reached on the phone, Chananya Gold said, “No comment. No comment at all.”

Ms. Mathis didn’t want to move. Her son, Derek, a graphic designer who is now 26, was living with her, and she suspected that her daughter, a college student, might need to move back in when she graduated. She also knew that her aunt, who intended to stay in the building, had a rent-stabilized unit, so she went to see a lawyer. (Her mother had since retired to North Carolina.)

The lawyer discovered that not only was Ms. Mathis a rent-stabilized tenant as well — lease or no — but she had been charged more than the legally allowable rent all those years. It felt like a victory. But before long, she realized that fighting for her right to stay was only the first of many skirmishes.

In the fall of 2015, the heat never came on. The landlord told tenants the heating system needed to be replaced, but the winter passed without heat — at least for the rent-stabilized units: The five market-rate units were renovated with working heat that was billed to those tenants.

The heat didn’t come on in Ms. Mathis’s apartment the following year either, and a solution that involved installing furnaces in the rent-stabilized apartments didn’t pass muster with city inspectors. By now, Ms. Mathis has spent two winters in an unheated apartment, huddled under electric blankets.

“The first year without heat, my aunt was 79. To do that to someone of that age — I might have considered leaving if she wasn’t in the building,” Ms. Mathis said. “But she’s on fixed income and wouldn’t be able to stay in the neighborhood if she left. She and my mom were really close, so I felt like I have no choice but to stay and fight.”

She continued: “It really affects the quality of life not to have heat: It’s hard to clean. It’s hard to do anything. I like to cook and have family over, and I lost two Thanksgivings and two Christmases.”

Photo

There have also been frequent gas leaks, Ms. Mathis said, one of which revealed that one of the five market-rate apartments in the building had been paying for the cooking gas of the three rent-stabilized units. Another leak caused the building’s hot water and cooking gas to be shut off for a month last spring.

As a result of the shared hardships, the tenants — old and new — have banded together to file several lawsuits against the landlord, including for the illegal destabilization of the renovated apartments, which have been carved into four- and five-bedrooms that rent, per room, for nearly as much as Ms. Mathis pays for her entire apartment. And last spring, they organized a rent strike.

“God has been very benevolent in putting the people in this building together,” Ms. Mathis said. “Some are good at social media, some are good at writing, a few people are union organizers and some are arts-inclined — they made the signs that we put up in the window.”

Ms. Mathis is optimistic that she’ll finally have heat this winter, after reaching a housing court settlement with the landlord. Large metal heating ducts, installed the previous winter, hang from her hall ceiling, and the furnace that was once mounted inside her front door has been moved to the basement.

The yearslong ordeal has had one unexpected benefit. “We’re a very tight-knit building now,” Ms. Mathis said. “I don’t know if we’d have this kind of connection otherwise.”","Staying in Crown Heights, Even as It Gentrifies",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/realestate/staying-in-crown-heights-even-as-it-gentrifies.html

Much like this improvised field trip, his artistic endeavors don’t adhere to any prescribed path. “I don’t think my life conforms to that narrative,” he said with a moody shrug. “Things come out when they come out, but it doesn’t correlate with when decisions were made.”

It’s fitting then, that “Half-Light” is a slippery, elusive album concerned with memory and dreams. It’s elegiac and eclectic, a long way from the erudite indie rock that he helped write, play and produce for Vampire Weekend.

In 2016, he shocked fans when he announced via Twitter that he’d be venturing out on his own. “There is so much amazing music — all of it dear to me — on its way to you,” he wrote then. “It’s an exciting time and I feel lucky to share it with you.”

Mr. Batmanglij made good on his promise. He has produced songs with a wide range of performers since, including Frank Ocean, Solange Knowles, Carly Rae Jepsen and the sisterly trio Haim, making him a sort of consigliere to the slightly hipper edge of the pop music scene.

“A lot of what being a producer is, is giving people space,” he said of his ability to work with such a varied roster. “Like psychologically being there to help them realize what they’re trying to do.”

It also helps to have an outsider’s perspective. The son of Iranian immigrants, he was raised in Washington, D.C., and came out as gay with little fanfare in a 2010 Rolling Stone article. (He was already out to his parents and to his college friends.) All those elements inform, but do not necessarily define, his work.

In that way, he is part of a growing vanguard of artists like Mr. Ocean and Dev Hynes, making music that is, by virtue of its creator, a commentary on race, sexuality and identity.

“I certainly think that my music is a response to my experience as a person who doesn’t identify as straight, as a person who grew up American,” he said. “I’ve always had a complex relationship towards my identity as an American.”

Mr. Batmanglij walked north along Diamond Street, and passed a large building with prewar flourishes on a sleepy stretch of Meserole Avenue, where Halloween skeletons and pumpkins adorned the entrance. He studied it for a moment.

“Maybe it was this building,” he said. “I’m trying to remember the building that I lived in.” After deciding this wasn’t it, he kept walking, looking about. The neighborhood no doubt has changed in the decade since he lived here, but he was surprised by its consistency. “This street’s not different at all,” he said to himself, half-smiling.

Mr. Batmanglij has a tendency to speak slowly and cautiously, and is unafraid to give a succinct answer followed by a inscrutable laugh. He won’t say what model car he drives, whether he is involved with anyone romantically, or who makes his gray jeans. (“They’re French,” he said.)

He thought he had revealed too much as is. “In my next phase I’m not even going to tell people where I live,” he said.

He approached Cafe Grumpy, a coffee shop he lived above many years ago (and the one made famous in the TV show “Girls”). “Ah, it smells the same,” he said, entering. Freelance types pecked away at their laptops.

“What’s the matcha cider like?” he asked the barista.

“Its like cider, with matcha,” the barista replied flatly, before adding, “It’s not my personal favorite.”

Mr. Batmanglij opted for a mint tea before continuing on his way.

His recent sold-out show at the Music Hall of Williamsburg hosted a diverse crowd. “Some people said, ‘I was surprised at how many hetero guys were at your show,’” he said. “And other people said, ‘You were definitely the soundtrack to a lot of gay couples making out.’”

If Mr. Batmanglij wears his sexuality lightly, it’s partly because he recognizes that gay life has been integrated into the larger culture. “The idea of the gay experience, it feels like a relic,” he said. “I felt like in the ’90s when we were watching the gay characters on ‘The Real World,’ there was definitely a gay experience that was distinct from a straight experience. If you talk to high schoolers in 2017, I don’t know that is as much a part of how they experience a social dynamic.”

Still, it’s refreshing to hear Mr. Batmanglij playfully sing about “two boys, one to kiss your neck and one to bring you breakfast,” in the song “Bike Dream.”

As he turned a corner, Mr. Batmanglij put his blue shirt back on and stopped before a two-story beige building on an industrial block.

“That was a pretty good place to live,” he said, pointing to a rather sad-looking window on the second floor. He had furnished that apartment with a rented upright piano, which he ended up buying and bringing to Los Angeles. “Recorded a lot of music there,” he said, before continuing his walk.","Rostam Batmanglij, Formerly of Vampire Weekend, Gets Lost in Brooklyn",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/style/rostam-batmanglij-half-light-vampire-weekend-brooklyn.html

Ms. Drake hopes that by the end of 2018, the writer will have told a story of the world that others can see themselves in.","When she initially conceived of the “52 Places” job and worked with video, interactives, and masthead editors to develop its duties, Ms. Drake thought of it as a sort of “grown-up gap year,” a reflection of the growing popularity, over the last few decades, of Wanderjahr-like jaunts. “This is the way that people travel now,” Ms. Drake said. “A lot of people work remotely, so they don’t travel for weeks, but for months.”

But applicant beware: The task will be no vacation. It’s a given that the successful candidate will have to be an expert traveler, with the stamina to spend a full year navigating the world. Fluency in multiple forms of storytelling — words and images, but also more inventive means afforded by social media and interactive technology — is also a must. Ms. Drake’s team has always approached the yearly lists as a sandbox to play with new storytelling techniques; the new job will push that creative spirit yet further.

And forget about staying at the Ritz all year. The writer won’t be staying exclusively at hostels, but accommodations will be location- and budget-appropriate. Such limitations serve a purpose: journalistic quality control in an environment where breezy relationships between travel bloggers and sponsoring brands are common — and difficult to see.

“If you’re reading somebody on Instagram, it’s sort of hard to tell why they picked a certain place,” Ms. Drake said. That perfectly composed shot may better represent the generosity of a hotel’s public relations department than it does the average traveler’s experience. A Times correspondent, however, cannot accept gifts in trade, so any destination featured will be on its merits alone, regardless of platform.

Most important, the job is not to take exhaustive inventory, but rather to tell a coherent and comprehensive story of a place, even when things go wrong — a major challenge that affects how Ms. Drake reads applications. “There are some people who can technically do this job, but we want more than that,” she said. “We want someone compelling enough they can find a way to tell that story. It’s kind of like casting.”

Ms. Drake hopes that by the end of 2018, the writer will have told a story of the world that others can see themselves in. “Having one person recount the experiences of all of them could make it seem like it’s more within your reach,” she said, adding what candidates might take as advice: “Make it universal.

Sergeant Walters suggested that commanders never would have sent their own men from the battalion on such a high-risk patrol.
But as he left the witness stand and walked past the defense table, he shot Sergeant Bergdahl a withering glare.","“I’m admitting I made a horrible mistake,” the sergeant said on the witness stand. “It was never my intention for anyone to be hurt, and I never expected that to happen.”

As a candidate, Mr. Trump repeatedly called Sergeant Bergdahl a traitor and suggested that he should be executed or returned to the Taliban. On Oct. 16, Mr. Trump seemed to endorse those earlier sentiments, declining to say anything new about the case but adding, “I think people have heard my comments in the past.”

An Army investigator initially recommended that there be no jail time for Sergeant Bergdahl, who was held and tortured by the Taliban for five years. But anger — on the part of politicians and members of the military — over the sergeant’s actions may have contributed to the fact that he now faces the possibility of a long sentence.

In sentencing, mitigating factors weigh in favor of leniency while aggravating factors tip the scales toward harsher punishment. The judge’s decision means he will weigh Mr. Trump’s comments along with other mitigating factors presented by the defense, including evidence that Sergeant Bergdahl had a severe mental disorder and suffered torture in captivity.

Colonel Nance will also consider aggravating factors presented by the prosecution, including injuries suffered by several service members during the search for Sergeant Bergdahl, as well as the negative impact they say the search had on the military’s overall war effort in Afghanistan.

Anger over the injuries has driven much of the testimony in the case so far, as service members vividly described a rescue operation that exposed them to enemy fire. Shannon Allen, the wife of Sgt. First Class Mark Allen, who was shot in the head took the stand on Monday.

Sergeant Allen, a national guardsman from Georgia, had part of his brain removed during surgery, and is now unable to speak, walk, or take care of himself. His wife has said little publicly, but in a Facebook post after Sergeant Bergdahl was freed, she blamed him for causing her husband’s incapacitation.

“Instead of being his wife, I have become his caregiver,” Ms. Allen testified on Monday.

Last week, Staff Sgt. Jason Walters testified that his six-man team had only just arrived in Afghanistan when they were sent to search for Sergeant Bergdahl. They had little time to prepare for the rugged terrain of Paktika Province, and little intelligence to go on.

On the second morning of the search, “an insane amount of fire came out of nowhere,” Sergeant Walters said. Militants had them surrounded. In minutes, half the team had been wounded. Sergeant Walters turned to see “a cloud of blood” spraying from the head of Sergeant Allen.

“I started treating his wounds, talking to him, telling him to hang on,” Sergeant Walters said.

The battle subsided only after F-15 fighter jets and Apache helicopters arrived overhead.

Only later would the troops learn that the battalion responsible for the area believed that 150 Taliban fighters were near the village where the soldiers were resting when they came under fire.

“My words can’t take away what people have been through,” Sergeant Bergdahl told the court on Monday. “Offering condolences is not enough. People went through things they shouldn’t have had to go through. I grieve for those who have suffered and their families.”

The Army’s investigation of the rescue operation described faults with its planning, preparation, equipment and intelligence. Sergeant Bergdahl’s defense team has also argued to the judge that the Taliban — not their client — were directly responsible for Sergeant Allen’s wounds.

Prosecutors have sought to show that the attack would have played out similarly even without the problems cited. Increased risks were acceptable, they say, if the missing soldier was thought to be near.

But in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the investigation showed, some of Sergeant Allen’s comrades were upset with the officers who ordered the operation.

“We should have never went out there in the first place, and we would not have lost three of our guys in the process,” said Staff Sgt. Travis Scott Elmore, referring to the wounded. He was one of the six-member Embedded Training Team, or E.T.T. He had been told only afterward that the battalion responsible for that area believed there were 150 Taliban fighters nearby.

“We didn’t have the manpower, and that was the first mission that our E.T.T. team has ever conducted” with Afghan troops, he said in a sworn statement to Army investigators.

Sergeant Walters suggested that commanders never would have sent their own men from the battalion on such a high-risk patrol.

“They treat us like a redheaded stepchild whose only purpose there is to be used at their convenience and for the missions they don’t want to risk their own men on,” he wrote in his statement.

In court, Sergeant Bergdahl gave details about his captivity, saying that he had once used a nail sharpened with a rock to pick the locks on his shackles and escape. He had planned to subsist on grass, he said, but because the area was heavily populated by herds of sheep and goats, there was little available.

He fell off a cliff into a dry riverbed, he said. After eight days at large, he would “black out and fall over” when he tried to stand up.

When he was recaptured, the Taliban beat him and placed him in a cage that would be his home for the next four years, he said.

Another search for Sergeant Bergdahl, this one conducted at night, was recounted last week by Jimmy Hatch, who was a Senior Chief Petty Officer and member of a Navy SEAL special operations team. After helicopters dropped off his team, Chief Hatch sent his military working dog after two people he suspected were enemy fighters. One shot the dog in the head. The other sprayed his gun wildly.

The muzzle flashes allowed American troops to locate and kill the fighters — but not before one shot Chief Hatch, shattering his thighbone, he said. He would later have 18 surgical procedures, and still walks with a pronounced limp.

“I was worse than useless,” Chief Hatch said, recalling his fear that his screams might endanger fellow troops.

Track Your Sleep

The second most useful app I have on my phone (after my food tracker) is Sleep Cycle. I turn it on when I’m about to fall asleep, and it tracks the duration and quality of my rest. Modern technology — what a world!

Of all the aspects of the quantified self I engage in, analyzing my sleep patterns is by far my favorite. In the same way a food tracker forces you to look at what you put into your body, tracking your sleep makes you realize you’re probably not getting nearly as much sleep as you should.

Of course, you can always go low-tech and keep a sleep diary — and to help you out, here is the handy NYT sleep diary you can print for all your tracking needs.

Figure Out if You’re a Morning Person

While we’re listening to our bodies, let’s be honest: Do mornings just not work for you? It’s fine if they don’t! But knowing is half the battle, and by not listening to your natural rhythms you might be trying to create certain sleep habits that simply aren’t a fit for your life.

Here’s the NYT quiz to find out whether you’re a morning person or a creature of the night.

If You’re Tired During the Day, Take a Nap

My personal favorite bit of sleep advice: If you’re tired, take a nap. Research has shown that midday naps can help improve your productivity at work and, assuming you don’t take them too late in the afternoon, they generally don’t negatively affect your sleep schedule. (And perhaps you’ve picked up on our theme here: Listen to your body!)

Belgium is virtually the only national government in Europe that has been even remotely sympathetic to Mr. Puigdemont’s pleas for mediation, not least perhaps because the country has faced separatist tensions of its own led by Flemish hard-liners.

Awkwardly, Brussels is also the headquarters of a European Union bureaucracy that has held the Catalan secessionists at arms’ length, for fear of upsetting Spain, one of the bloc’s largest member states, and stoking forces of fragmentation in other parts of the Continent.

On Monday, while there was no official confirmation that Mr. Puigdemont had gone to Brussels, the Belgian and Spanish news media variously suggested that he had arrived for consultations, to seek political asylum, or to even declare a Catalan “government in exile.”

The speculation kicked into high gear not long after Spain’s attorney general, José Manuel Maza, called around noon in Madrid for the prosecution of Mr. Puigdemont and another 19 Catalan politicians, stopping short of ordering their immediate arrest.

Mr. Maza said he wanted them Catalan politicians to appear “urgently” in court in Madrid. A decision would be left to Spanish judges whether to charge or jail them. The politicians could face 30 years in prison for the most serious of the potential charges, which included rebellion and sedition.

Officially, the Belgian government said they had no knowledge of Mr. Puigdemont’s presence in their country.

But the statements of some officials seemed to hint at an openness to accepting Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan officials if they chose exile.

“It is not unrealistic, if you see the situation at this moment, and the repression from Madrid and the prison sentences with which they are threatening, that the question is whether such a person still has a chance to a fair trial of course,” Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, told VTM News, a Belgian television station, over the weekend.

“That’s where we enter into a difficult diplomatic situation with the Spanish government,” he added.

Mr. Francken is a member of the New Flemish Alliance party, which favors Flemish independence from the rest of Belgium and has historically had strong links to the Catalan separatists as a kindred movement. Earlier this month, members of the alliance hung the Catalan independence flag — the Estelada —in the Belgian Parliament, in a gesture of support.

But Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel, has dismissed the possibility of granting asylum to Mr. Puigdemont, saying it “is absolutely not on the agenda” and called on Mr. Francken “not to fan the flames.”

Mr. Puigdemont’s arrival presents a direct challenge to Mr. Michel, a Federalist, who as the leader of a delicate government coalition, will have to keep separatists in his own government in check while trying to maintain good diplomatic relations with Spain.

Spanish media had reported that Mr. Puigdemont had left Catalonia with five other deposed members of his cabinet, by car to the southern French city of Marseille, and then by plane to Brussels.

Officials from Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s conservative Popular Party said their priority on Monday was to make sure Mr. Puigdemont did not try to stay in office, by insisting he remained leader of Catalonia, rather than worry about him escaping the country.

Fernando Martínez-Maíllo, a senior Popular Party official, characterized Mr. Puigdemont’s departure as “a desperate act.”

Albert Rivera, the leader of the Ciudadanos party, which is strongly opposed to secession, accused Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist leadership of “fleeing the country” while leaving his Catalan civil servants to resist and continue to break Spanish law.

Indeed, the forcible steps by the central government have now left Catalan civil servants and politicians with the painful choice of sticking to their secessionist plans and defying Madrid’s direct administration or facing the potential of criminal charges.

Not least, there was the important decision for separatist parties about whether to take part in regional elections called by Madrid or to risk sidelining themselves.

The two main Catalan parties — including Mr. Puigdemont’s Catalan European Democratic Party — said on Monday they would run in the elections, which are scheduled for Dec. 21, although perhaps no longer as part of the coalition that won the most parliamentary seats in 2015.

Germà Bel, a separatist Catalan lawmaker, said Mr. Puigdemont’s possible hopes of running a government from exile was “symbolic.”

“I don’t know of anyone who’s run a government from overseas,” he said. “Even Charles de Gaulle didn’t run a government from overseas.”

But he argued that it would be hard for Mr. Rajoy’s government to maintain control over Catalonia for an extended period.

The decision by pro-independence parties to take part in the December elections meant that they “at least implicitly” accept they are still part of Spain — no small concession.

“This election has been called by the Spanish government under Spanish law — and it will be an election run within the state,” Mr. Bel said.

With the emergency measures taken over the weekend, Mr. Rajoy opted not to appoint a caretaker leader of Catalonia.

Instead, the country’s deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, took over the management of the Catalan administration from Madrid, and dispatched a senior central government official to Barcelona on Monday.

Juan Ignacio Zoido, the Spanish interior minister, said on Monday that the takeover of the Catalan police force, known as the Mossos, had gone smoothly. He fired the Mossos police chief, Josep Lluís Trapero, over the weekend and appointed the deputy leader of the force, Ferran López, to the post.

Under the emergency measures allowed by Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the provision invoked by Mr. Rajoy to take control of Catalonia, the national government could replace the 17,000 officers of the Mossos with Spanish police officers.

But Mr. Zoido said that “at no point did we consider eliminating the Mossos police corps.”

Mr. Zoido called on separatist leaders to remove their personal belongings from their offices on Monday and to leave, focusing solely on preparing for the December elections, as candidates.

At least one member of Mr. Puigdemont’s ousted cabinet, Josep Rull, defiantly went to work Monday morning, after the region’s president sent a message over the weekend urging Catalans to peacefully oppose Madrid’s takeover and the removal of a democratically elected regional government.

After spending one hour in his office, Mr. Rull, the Catalan minister for planning and sustainability, left in a waiting car, but without his police detail, telling reporters that he had not removed his belongings from his office.

“Today I came to my office to carry out the work that the Catalan people entrusted to us,” he said. “And now I will continue, normally, with my agenda.”

The possibility that separatist leaders might be charged with rebellion has prompted a major dispute among Spanish lawyers.

Track Your Sleep

The second most useful app I have on my phone (after my food tracker) is Sleep Cycle. I turn it on when I’m about to fall asleep, and it tracks the duration and quality of my rest. Modern technology — what a world!

Of all the aspects of the quantified self I engage in, analyzing my sleep patterns is by far my favorite. In the same way a food tracker forces you to look at what you put into your body, tracking your sleep makes you realize you’re probably not getting nearly as much sleep as you should.

Of course, you can always go low-tech and keep a sleep diary — and to help you out, here is the handy NYT sleep diary you can print for all your tracking needs.

Figure Out if You’re a Morning Person

While we’re listening to our bodies, let’s be honest: Do mornings just not work for you? It’s fine if they don’t! But knowing is half the battle, and by not listening to your natural rhythms you might be trying to create certain sleep habits that simply aren’t a fit for your life.

Here’s the NYT quiz to find out whether you’re a morning person or a creature of the night.

If You’re Tired During the Day, Take a Nap

My personal favorite bit of sleep advice: If you’re tired, take a nap. Research has shown that midday naps can help improve your productivity at work and, assuming you don’t take them too late in the afternoon, they generally don’t negatively affect your sleep schedule. (And perhaps you’ve picked up on our theme here: Listen to your body!)

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.","When Annalisa Marchionna was a child, she and her parents vacationed in the Italian coastal town of Casalbordino Lido. One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

Faced with numerous real and undeniable atrocities, it was futile to postulate crimes that appeared to have no foundation and could be construed as propaganda.

Nevertheless, decades later, denunciations from Neruda’s former driver, Manuel Araya, mentioning a lethal injection administered to the poet hours before his death led a Chilean judge to exhume the author’s body and seek help from foreign forensic organizations to determine the true cause of death. And now 16 experts have announced that Neruda died of a bacterial infection rather than of cancer cachexia, as fraudulently stated on his death certificate.

Although they offered no evidence of foul play, their research has caused a certain amount of speculation. Contrasting with the inevitable circumspection of the forensic professionals, many Chileans — pundits, politicians, intellectuals, joined by one of Neruda’s nephews — take it as a given that an execution took place.

These renewed conjectures are bolstered by the circumstance that some years after Neruda’s death, former President Eduardo Frei Montalva died under suspicious circumstances in the same room at the very clinic where the great poet had expired.

It took many years of investigations, but the Chilean courts ruled that Frei was killed by a group of secret service agents. You could see why they murdered him: Frei, after initially supporting the military takeover, had become the valiant leader of the opposition to Gen. Augusto Pinochet.

Eliminating him was a way of getting rid of a figure who could rally and unify those who wanted democracy restored. A similar motive was behind the assassination in Washington of Orlando Letelier, the popular and charismatic minister of foreign affairs in Allende’s government.

But murdering Neruda still seems to make little sense. Why would Pinochet’s minions risk killing a poet who was already dying, a Nobel Prize winner revered by Chileans of all stripes and allegiances? Wasn’t he sick and weak, about to go into exile in Mexico, where he would have soon wasted away anyway?

Whatever the truth about his death, its effect was stunning. Neruda’s funeral on Sept. 26, 1973, became the first act of public defiance against Chile’s new rulers.

Braving the soldiers in the streets and the fear in their hearts, thousands of patriots accompanied Neruda’s coffin to the Cementerio General, saying goodbye to the poet who had told their story and the story of a Latin America in search of liberation. How could they fail to accompany on its final journey the body of the poet who had celebrated the human body in all its sensual desires and deepest despair?

These were the people who had learned from his verses how to shape their dreams and dream their love, and forlorn and enraged, they chanted that their bard was alive inside them. They promised that Allende, our dead president, would not be forgotten; they vowed that Chile would not succumb to tyranny.

The significance of the event did not lie only in the symbolism of so many men and women and even children endangering themselves to express their need for liberty. That funeral was also a blueprint for how the resistance would eventually defeat Pinochet in the arduous years to come: by taking over every tiny and large space available, by pushing back the limits of what was permissible, by stating, in the face of bayonets and bullets, that silence would not prevail.

In his most famous lines from “Canto General,” Neruda spoke to the anonymous dead of Latin America, writing, “Sube a nacer conmigo, hermano,” asking those forgotten and desecrated by history to be born again. “Rise up and be born with me, my brother.”

The renewed conversation around Neruda’s death allows us to remember him once more, see him yet again as a prophet in the battle against darkness and doom and oblivion. Just as yesterday when he was alive, our Pablo now continues, from beyond death, to send humanity a message of hope, encouraging the struggle for justice and freedom in our dire times.

It may take a long time, but the crimes of the past will not be suppressed. It may take a long time, Neruda’s memory is telling us, but there will, finally, be a reckoning. It may take a long time, Neruda’s poetry is telling us, but the victims of history will surely find a way to be born again.","Neruda, Pinochet and Rumors of Murder",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/pablo-neruda-murder.html

“The only thing we are asking is to move our bodies rhythmically. That’s it,” said one club owner.

8. One of our most-read stories for days is from the Irish town of Tuam, where the bones of 796 children were discovered near what used to be a home for unmarried mothers and their children.

People who lived in the home as small children — and a woman who grew up nearby and helped bring the tragedy to light — discussed it in this video. “There was no love. There was no care,” one man recalled.

Above, some of the children dressed up for their First Communion around 1950.

While coming out is often met with support by peers, fans and gay rights activists, the response was far different for Mr. Spacey.

“Coming out stories should not be used to deflect from allegations of sexual assault,” Sarah Kate Ellis, president and chief executive of Glaad, a gay rights organization, said in a statement. “This is not a coming out story about Kevin Spacey, but a story of survivorship by Anthony Rapp and all those who bravely speak out against unwanted sexual advances.

George Takei, who has used his large social media following to advocate social-justice causes, said in an emailed statement that Mr. Rapp’s accusations were about power, not sexuality.

“Men who improperly harass or assault do not do so because they are gay or straight — that is a deflection,” he said. “They do so because they have the power, and they chose to abuse it.”

Zachary Quinto, an actor, said in a statement that Mr. Spacey had come out not “as a point of pride” that could inspire children but “as a calculated manipulation to deflect attention from the very serious accusation that he attempted to molest one.”

“I am sorry that Kevin only saw fit to acknowledge his truth when he thought it would serve him — just as his denial served him for so many years,” he said.

In 2010, Kevin Sessums, a journalist, pressed Mr. Spacey on his sexuality in an interview for The Daily Beast.

“We gay men have always proudly claimed you as a member of our tribe, and yet you don’t proudly claim us back,” Mr. Sessums said. “Why?”

Mr. Spacey responded: “Look, I might have lived in England for the last several years but I’m still an American citizen and I have not given up my right to privacy.”

Mr. Sessums continued the line of questioning, but Mr. Spacey pivoted to a discussion of bullying without addressing his own sexuality.

The plea was unsealed on the same day that Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, and his longtime associate, Rick Gates, were indicted on charges of money laundering and conspiracy.

Mr. Papadopoulos was first interviewed by the F.B.I. in January, as the bureau was investigating connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. In that interview, Mr. Papadopoulos said that he began communicating with the professor and the Russian woman before he became a foreign policy adviser to the campaign.

The trial of Mr. Madsen is expected to begin in March. He has also been preliminarily charged with abuse of a corpse and “sexual relations under aggravating circumstances.”

During a court hearing in September, the prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen said the police had found a hard drive belonging to Mr. Madsen with videos showing the torture and killing of women. The videos did not appear to have been made by the inventor, Mr. Buch-Jepsen said.

“The videos indicate that one may have an interest in fetish, torture and murder,” he said in court. “These are some very grave videos with women recorded abroad.”

Ms. Wall, 30, was a freelance journalist from Trelleborg, a port town in southern Sweden. She studied at the London School of Economics and at Columbia University in New York, and her articles had appeared in several publications, including The New York Times.

Back Story

We begin Halloween with a ghost story.

Stingy Jack invited the devil for a drink.

As Irish folklore goes, Jack didn’t want to pay for the drinks, and instead convinced the devil to turn himself into a coin that could be used to settle the tab.

The devil agreed, but Jack ditched the tab and kept the coin. When he finally died, Stingy Jack was denied entry to both heaven and hell and instead was given a burning coal to light his way as he roamed the earth for eternity. He placed the coal in a carved-out turnip, turning it into a lantern.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Stingy Jack became known as “Jack of the Lantern,” or Jack-o’-Lantern, by the late 17th century. Elsewhere in Europe, making lanterns out of potatoes and beets was part of a fall harvest celebration. Lights were also thought to ward off evil spirits.

By the end of the 19th century, European immigrants in America switched their carving tradition over to pumpkins.

“The fortunate pumpkin is a noble fruit, a joy in the mouth of mankind, a paean of Autumn on the happy palate,” a 1942 Times article proclaimed. “The unfortunate pumpkin becomes a jack-o’-lantern.”

Mr. de Blasio pushed once again for a tax on wealthy New Yorkers to support transit spending and provide discounted rides to the poor.

“You go outside, and walk a few blocks away, you will see the offices of the millionaires and billionaires who dominate this nation,” Mr. de Blasio said. “My friends, I know where the money is.”

Mr. Sanders, who was expected to hold an endorsement rally with Mr. de Blasio Monday night, said he supported the mayor’s plan. But he said he did not intend to pick sides in a dispute over transit funding between Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has declared the mayor’s tax hike a non-starter in the Republican-dominated State Senate.

“I’m not taking sides, to be honest with you. I’ve got enough to keep me busy in Washington,” said Mr. Sanders, adding he just thought the mayor’s tax-the-rich plan was a good idea. “I think it’s the right thing to do.”

With a schedule full of marquee political names, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, appeared eager on Monday to put behind him days of uncomfortable questions about his closeness to a high-dollar donor who pleaded guilty to federal fraud, and is cooperating with prosecutors in an another case.

The accusations fueled new rounds of negative headlines for the mayor and have animated the campaigns of his two main challengers, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican, and the independent candidate Bo Dietl, both of whom are expected to face Mr. de Blasio in a second and final debate on Wednesday.

The donor, Jona S. Rechnitz, has been testifying for days in the corruption trial of a former union boss about his contacts with the mayor after making tens of thousands in contributions. Mr. de Blasio faced questions at two news conferences over the weekend, including one to directly address the claims by the donor, whom the mayor on Saturday repeatedly attacked as “a liar and a felon.”

The mayor, who enjoyed a 40-point lead in polls early this month, has pointed out that the testimony involves accusations of pay-to-play activities by the de Blasio administration that investigators already looked into. No charges were brought against Mr. de Blasio or any of his staff.

But questions about his contacts with Mr. Rechnitz, a young and wealthy real estate investor who testified that he had a direct line to the mayor after giving well over $100,000 to his campaign and political causes, shadowed Mr. de Blasio throughout the day.

Mr. Schumer, a Democrat, declined to address several questions about whether the testimony weighed on his endorsement, which had been slated for Saturday but was rescheduled so that Mr. de Blasio could address the claims by Mr. Rechnitz.

“The mayor has done an outstanding job, he’s answered questions on those issues,” Senator Schumer said. “ I’m proud to endorse him.”

He then read a statement about the federal charges against President Trump’s campaign manger, Paul Manafort, and left eight minutes after arriving.

Mr. Sanders, an independent, likewise did not respond when asked about the issue at a later news conference, instead inviting Mr. de Blasio to take the question.

But by that point, Mr. de Blasio appeared to have been buoyed by the energy of his chaotic subway ride with Mr. Sanders, which included supportive hoots from riders, even though most of them were directed at the Vermont senator. (The mayor endorsed Mrs. Clinton in 2016, but has since embraced Mr. Sanders.)

The mayor and Mr. Sanders experienced the full panoply of the subways circa 2017: a 10-minute delay for their train because of an “earlier incident”; the screeching of trains in the other direction; a duo who sung and rapped for the two politicians; a train car packed wall-to-wall.

The Trump administration is considering rolling back federal protections for 10 national monuments, including two in the central Pacific. The Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument and the Rose Atoll National Marine Monument protect the waters around a handful of islands, most uninhabited, to the south of the Hawaii Islands.

The shore reefs of the islands have long been protected from commercial fishing; the monument designations extended that protection to 50 miles from shore in some cases and 200 miles in others.

According to a memo obtained by the Washington Post in September, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has recommended that the designations of the Pacific Remote Islands and the Rose Atoll be amended “to allow commercial fishing.” (A similar recommendation was made for another marine monument, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, off the coast of New England.)

The memo did not mention the largest marine reserve: Papahānaumokuākea, a string of mostly uninhabited atolls and reefs that have been largely undisturbed since World War II. At about 583,000 square miles, it is the largest protected area on the planet. (Industry officials in Hawaii are pressing for commercial fishing to be allowed there, too.)

Many scientists see these marine reserves as among the last rich, untouched ecosystems where they can study the effects of climate change in isolation from the impacts of overfishing or pollution.

The fishing industry here in Hawaii sees it differently. A driving force behind the administration’s reconsideration is an obscure but powerful quasi-governmental organization called the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, or Wespac, based in Honolulu. The council has jurisdiction over the waters where 140 long-line vessels based in Hawaii — as well as a handful in American Samoa — fish mostly for tuna and billfish.

Wespac has argued that limits on catch, gear and fishing seasons are the best tools to regulate fishing and to ensure that the Pacific yields the maximum sustainable harvests. Over the years, the council has strongly opposed the creation and expansions of each of the marine monuments.

This year, the council has embraced a new slogan: “Make America Great Again: Return U.S. fishermen to U.S. waters.” In a presentation to members of the other fisheries councils in February, Wespac officials claimed the marine monuments “curtailed economic growth” and “compromised national food security.”

Ray Hilborn, a fisheries expert at the University of Washington and a scientific adviser to Wespac, argues that tuna and billfish are highly migratory and travel in and out of the reserves. “The monuments just force the fishermen to go farther and spend more fuel to catch the same fish,” he said in an interview. “It’s a fake protection.”

Asked whether Wespac sought to reintroduce fishing only in monument waters or also in near-shore reefs, Kitty Simonds, the longtime executive director, said in an email that the council also would review “the management measures that were in place before the monument designation and may recommend changes.”

The fishing industry in Hawaii is hardly in trouble, several experts noted. Indeed, the Hawaii fleet’s bigeye tuna catch has doubled since 2006, even though half of America’s Pacific waters are now off-limits to fishing.

Robert Richmond, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii, pointed out that the Hawaii fleet filled its yearly quota of bigeye in August this year, “so they obviously don’t need more space to fish. They’re just against all protected areas on principle.”

Over 500 million people depend on reefs for protein, Dr. Richmond said, and they already yield far less than they could if they were sustainably fished. Reef ecosystems may become even less productive as the ocean gets warmer and more acidic.

Dr. Richmond and other scientists also took issue with Dr. Hilborn’s criticism of marine monuments. They say the reserves serve as havens for species depleted elsewhere and for populations migrating away from the Equator, where warming waters are lowering plankton density.

“The fisheries benefits of marine reserves are now beyond doubt,” Callum Roberts, a marine conservation biologist at the University of York, said in an email. “They allow fish populations to grow back and spill fish into surrounding waters, they pour fountains of offspring into ocean currents that seed fisheries, and they provide resilience to environmental shocks.”

The tools favored by fisheries officials target a few species to the neglect of others, he added, while “reserve benefits reach entire ecosystems.”

One of the islands on Mr. Zinke’s list is Palmyra, an atoll that lies 1,000 miles south of Hawaii and is part of the Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

This is the sweetest part of any dinner party: disappearing into the kitchen for just a few minutes.","The Food Issue

I don’t think of it as entertaining, but I love cooking for friends, keeping their glasses full, tumbling in and out of their conversations throughout the night because I have to sprint outside when the buzzer is broken or I catch a whiff of something in the oven. Off duty, on the weekends, with a little stretch of free time in front of me, I’ll plan a night around a familiar dish that feeds a crowd. The lineup changes with the season, but when chilled air rushes in through the gaps in the apartment wall, it’s time for fondue.

There is zero winky-faced sarcasm in my love for fondue. I have always loved it sincerely. By the time I became aware of its enduring novelty status in the United States, it was too late to curb my affection. I didn’t know about the broken fantasy it represented or the shades of harvest gold and avocado green it conjured. I wasn’t in on the joke about matchy-matchy fondue sets, neglected in boxes across millions of suburban American garages, and had no reference point for the cliché of couples in bell sleeves, adhering to the etiquette set forth in guidebooks and pamphlets.

I was introduced to fondue in my parents’ home, where friends and colleagues often joined us for dinner, chatting in the kitchen with my parents while they cooked. This was in rural France in the ’90s, but it didn’t really matter what decade it was: When the radiators clanked furiously and the house smelled of warm, rising dust, my father initiated a timeless routine. He put on a laminated green apron that had been designed for a much, much shorter man and then he blasted Sarah Vaughan while grating three kinds of cheese.

Table Talk We all know what society says we’re not supposed to talk about at a dinner party. Religion. Politics. Salaries. And yet these topics should be fair game. What’s a dinner party if not a laboratory of ideas, plus permission to eat cheese?

When everyone was there — shoes off, glasses full — he melted that cheese inside a lightweight ceramic pot and balanced it over a dented fuel can on the kitchen table, which he steadied with folded-up used envelopes saved for this exact purpose. As my brother and I waved our long, barbed forks around in vicious, joyful anticipation, ready to spike bread and green beans and potatoes and drag them all through hot cheese, my father issued a warning. If we got too rowdy and toppled the fuel, the house would most certainly catch on fire, in which case we should all run directly outside to safety and not go upstairs for anything. This was our ritual.

My own routine is not so different. I prepare everything for the fondue in advance, in the morning, and it isn’t much: Cut a baguette into pieces, boil some potatoes, grate the cheese and wrap it up tightly in the fridge. I quick-pickle some vegetables in rice vinegar to crunch on between heavier bites. I make a rough puff pastry for some kind of fruit tart or defrost a sheet of store-bought puff pastry. A few minutes before people arrive, I clear the stacks of books and magazines and yesterday’s mugs off the coffee table and fill it with snacks we can pick up with our hands: halved radishes with a lump of butter that’s been left out long enough to get very soft. Thin slices of saucisson sec piled in a saucer. Great big white beans with lemon zest dripping with olive oil and crunchy salt, along with some toothpicks to grab them one by one. This is the type of dinner party that I can decide to host the night before, or even the morning of, and still pull together. That’s part of the pleasure.

Table Talk Don’t worry about dangerous conversational territory. The most memorable conversations are the product of guests who dare to provoke, titillate and argue. The trick is to create a permissive atmosphere with civility and style. The goal, Elaine Stritch once told us, is to be a “ladylike broad”: half civilized charmer, half wisecracking bomb-thrower.

As friends arrive, we sit down with glasses of something cold and bubbly and keep open bottles in reach, on the table. And within an hour or so, everyone’s in and squashed around the snacks, which are getting sparse, which means it’s time to get the food on the table. This is the sweetest part of any dinner party: disappearing into the kitchen for just a few minutes. The apartment is noisy with brilliant people I love, and I can hear their voices in the other room, getting louder. A seltzer bottle hisses. A cork pops. Someone skips two songs ahead on my phone and turns the volume up on the speaker. A friend wanders into the kitchen, distracted on her way out to smoke, and we exchange a few pieces of crucial gossip. Does it count as hospitality if it’s a little bit selfish? I feel less fragile when my friends are over and we’re fortifying ourselves around the table.

While I stir the grated cheeses into a slurry of simmering white wine and cornstarch, my boyfriend makes a simple salad, the kind you don’t need a recipe for, ripping speckled radicchio and herbs and dressing the leaves with salt, pepper, vinegar and olive oil. If someone asks if he can help, I tell him to find a bowl and tip the jar of cornichons into it or to open another bottle of wine. There’s nothing else to do. We sit where we like, and the conversations contract and expand continuously, from two or three people talking intensely, to the entire table, and back again. By the time the pot is almost spent, some are experimenting with their last bites, wrapping a cheese-glazed cornichon inside a dressed radicchio leaf or dipping a stack of pickled beets into the cheese, staining it purple.

Table Talk A single conversation will not convince a lifelong liberal that it’s O.K. to own an arsenal of assault rifles. The perfect retort will not convince a conservative that we should be taxed to fund performance art. Accept this. It’s amazing how much more relaxed a political argument becomes when you understand that you don’t have to — and in fact won’t — “win.”

Over heat, in almost any cooking vessel, the cheese can burble along for hours, but it never lasts that long. When it’s all gone, what’s left is a dark, golden crust, clinging to the bottom of the pot. It tastes like the edge of a grilled cheese when the filling has run over and gone crisp. This means someone wants to peel it off and divide it up like the cash after a heist — dramatically, unfairly. If anyone has an appetite after that — which is rare, but it happens — I crack an egg into the bottom of the pan, as my father did, and let it cook until the whites are set but the yolk is still quite runny, and people drag more bread and potatoes through it, picking up the last lacy bits of browned cheese.

I don’t push the egg, though, because I believe in dessert. A sharp, fruity one is ideal after so much cheese, the kind that can be served without ice cream or whipped cream or dairy of any kind. I like a very plain, thin, crisp apple tart — lemon juice mixed in with the fruit, butter and sugar smeared underneath the pastry, so that while it cooks, its bottom is glazed with caramel. I put a bottle of Calvados down and bring the tart to the table as it is, on parchment paper, in the sheet pan it was baked in, with a long knife.

The dog always insists on going out when I put the kettle on for tea, and by the time I’m back, the water is boiling. The table is half cleared, and my friends have moved back to the couch with their glasses and some seconds of apple tart. They don’t need me to entertain them.

Belgium is virtually the only national government in Europe that has been even remotely sympathetic to Mr. Puigdemont’s pleas for mediation, not least perhaps because the country has faced separatist tensions of its own led by Flemish hard-liners.

Awkwardly, Brussels is also the headquarters of a European Union bureaucracy that has held the Catalan secessionists at arms’ length, for fear of upsetting Spain, one of the bloc’s largest member states, and stoking forces of fragmentation in other parts of the Continent.

On Monday, while there was no official confirmation that Mr. Puigdemont had gone to Brussels, the Belgian and Spanish news media variously suggested that he had arrived for consultations, to seek political asylum, or to even declare a Catalan “government in exile.”

The speculation kicked into high gear not long after Spain’s attorney general, José Manuel Maza, called around noon in Madrid for the prosecution of Mr. Puigdemont and another 19 Catalan politicians, stopping short of ordering their immediate arrest.

Mr. Maza said he wanted them Catalan politicians to appear “urgently” in court in Madrid. A decision would be left to Spanish judges whether to charge or jail them. The politicians could face 30 years in prison for the most serious of the potential charges, which included rebellion and sedition.

Officially, the Belgian government said they had no knowledge of Mr. Puigdemont’s presence in their country.

But the statements of some officials seemed to hint at an openness to accepting Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan officials if they chose exile.

“It is not unrealistic, if you see the situation at this moment, and the repression from Madrid and the prison sentences with which they are threatening, that the question is whether such a person still has a chance to a fair trial of course,” Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, told VTM News, a Belgian television station, over the weekend.

“That’s where we enter into a difficult diplomatic situation with the Spanish government,” he added.

Mr. Francken is a member of the New Flemish Alliance party, which favors Flemish independence from the rest of Belgium and has historically had strong links to the Catalan separatists as a kindred movement. Earlier this month, members of the alliance hung the Catalan independence flag — the Estelada —in the Belgian Parliament, in a gesture of support.

But Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel, has dismissed the possibility of granting asylum to Mr. Puigdemont, saying it “is absolutely not on the agenda” and called on Mr. Francken “not to fan the flames.”

Mr. Puigdemont’s arrival presents a direct challenge to Mr. Michel, a Federalist, who as the leader of a delicate government coalition, will have to keep separatists in his own government in check while trying to maintain good diplomatic relations with Spain.

Spanish media had reported that Mr. Puigdemont had left Catalonia with five other deposed members of his cabinet, by car to the southern French city of Marseille, and then by plane to Brussels.

Officials from Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s conservative Popular Party said their priority on Monday was to make sure Mr. Puigdemont did not try to stay in office, by insisting he remained leader of Catalonia, rather than worry about him escaping the country.

Fernando Martínez-Maíllo, a senior Popular Party official, characterized Mr. Puigdemont’s departure as “a desperate act.”

Albert Rivera, the leader of the Ciudadanos party, which is strongly opposed to secession, accused Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist leadership of “fleeing the country” while leaving his Catalan civil servants to resist and continue to break Spanish law.

Indeed, the forcible steps by the central government have now left Catalan civil servants and politicians with the painful choice of sticking to their secessionist plans and defying Madrid’s direct administration or facing the potential of criminal charges.

Not least, there was the important decision for separatist parties about whether to take part in regional elections called by Madrid or to risk sidelining themselves.

The two main Catalan parties — including Mr. Puigdemont’s Catalan European Democratic Party — said on Monday they would run in the elections, which are scheduled for Dec. 21, although perhaps no longer as part of the coalition that won the most parliamentary seats in 2015.

“I don’t know of anyone who’s run a government from overseas,” he said. “Even Charles de Gaulle didn’t run a government from overseas.”

But he argued that it would be hard for Mr. Rajoy’s government to maintain control over Catalonia for an extended period.

The decision by pro-independence parties to take part in the December elections meant that they “at least implicitly” accept they are still part of Spain — no small concession.

“This election has been called by the Spanish government under Spanish law — and it will be an election run within the state,” Mr. Bel said.

With the emergency measures taken over the weekend, Mr. Rajoy opted not to appoint a caretaker leader of Catalonia.

Instead, the country’s deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, took over the management of the Catalan administration from Madrid, and dispatched a senior central government official to Barcelona on Monday.

Juan Ignacio Zoido, the Spanish interior minister, said on Monday that the takeover of the Catalan police force, known as the Mossos, had gone smoothly. He fired the Mossos police chief, Josep Lluís Trapero, over the weekend and appointed the deputy leader of the force, Ferran López, to the post.

Under the emergency measures allowed by Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the provision invoked by Mr. Rajoy to take control of Catalonia, the national government could replace the 17,000 officers of the Mossos with Spanish police officers.

But Mr. Zoido said that “at no point did we consider eliminating the Mossos police corps.”

Mr. Zoido called on separatist leaders to remove their personal belongings from their offices on Monday and to leave, focusing solely on preparing for the December elections, as candidates.

At least one member of Mr. Puigdemont’s ousted cabinet, Josep Rull, defiantly went to work Monday morning, after the region’s president sent a message over the weekend urging Catalans to peacefully oppose Madrid’s takeover and the removal of a democratically elected regional government.

After spending one hour in his office, Mr. Rull, the Catalan minister for planning and sustainability, left in a waiting car, but without his police detail, telling reporters that he had not removed his belongings from his office.

“Today I came to my office to carry out the work that the Catalan people entrusted to us,” he said. “And now I will continue, normally, with my agenda.”

The possibility that separatist leaders might be charged with rebellion has prompted a major dispute among Spanish lawyers.

Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are set to testify at congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday about the election and the power of their platforms.

Lawmakers are increasingly taking a critical tone with Silicon Valley, with Mr. Warner among the harshest. He has already pushed a bill requiring the companies to disclose who paid for digital political ads, the biggest legislative effort so far to regulate the companies.

Mr. Warner’s position is a sharp reversal. Before entering politics, he built a fortune that at one time was estimated at around $200 million as a technology and telecommunications investor and executive. His political identity, first as governor of Virginia and then as a senator, has been wrapped in promises to bring 21st century jobs. He has a broad and close network of tech executives and investors.

Mr. Warner is emblematic of the shifting politics for technology.

“Mark didn’t come to this point with the social media companies lightly,” said Saxby Chambliss, a retired Republican senator from Georgia who regularly meets with Mr. Warner and the Intelligence Committee chairman, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, to discuss the Russia investigation.

The reluctance of the technology companies to take seriously the investigation into Russian election meddling pushed Mr. Warner over the edge, Mr. Chambliss said.

“That is a poor attitude for American companies,” Mr. Chambliss added. “Mark will make sure this issue is highlighted because it needs to stop.”

Ahead of the hearings, Twitter and Facebook have scrambled to disarm lawmakers with announcements of voluntary changes to their advertising businesses. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, for example, spent a couple days in Washington promising more disclosures. Twitter announced it would disclose who buys political ads on its site, and it blocked two Russia-based media organizations from purchasing advertisements.

“Twitter is taking an appropriate and welcome step,” Representative Adam Schiff of California, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said last week.

The companies say the internal investigations and answering lawmakers’ questions are a top priority. In their announcements on voluntary ad disclosures, Twitter and Facebook said their stricter policies for who can place political ads and promises to make those purchases public are signs of their commitment to correcting their mistakes.

“We look forward to answering lawmakers’ questions,” said Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy for Facebook, in a statement. “We take this issue very seriously and think it’s important Congress gets the full picture of what happened, including what we know about Russian activity on our platform, and is able to share its assessment with the American public.”

But lawmakers said the companies, who have been interacting privately for months, still have a long way to go.

Last week, congressional aides said the online giants were pushing back against lawmakers. The companies argued against the ad disclosure bill and dragged their feet to participate in a hearing on Tuesday. Lobbyists for Facebook explained how their voluntary efforts on political ad disclosures could work better than regulations.

Twitter has not addressed its problems with automated accounts, known as bots, that can quickly spread propaganda or fake news. In addition, not all social media companies have announced that they will tighten rules for buying political ads, one of the most pressing issues. And even if they do, lawmakers should still make more disclosure a legal requirement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-sponsor of the disclosure bill with Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.

“If their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill,” Ms. Klobuchar said.

Much of the harshest criticism so far is coming from Democrats like Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar, which could limit the fallout for the tech companies. The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr, has been more reserved than Mr. Warner, for example.

Many Republicans are reluctant to add any regulations to businesses. Some are also afraid of crossing other party members or President Trump, who regularly play down Russian interference in the election.

Republicans have slowly begun calling for more scrutiny of the companies. But lawmakers who are more oriented toward free markets have been reluctant to regulate the rapidly evolving industry. Other top regulators, particularly those appointed by Mr. Trump, are also considered unlikely to take strong action against the industry.

The top antitrust enforcer at the Justice Department, Makan Delrahim, said in an interview last week that his agency would watch to see whether the size of technology companies hurts competition, but that size alone was not justification for action against them.

“There are people who think big is just bad,” Mr. Delrahim said. He invoked the name of Robert Jackson, the top antitrust enforcer for the agency about 80 years ago, who said he was reluctant to try to break up big companies just for the sake of doing so.

That has made it easier for Mr. Warner to assert himself as a leading voice about the power of the tech companies — as unexpected as it may be.

Mr. Warner accumulated his wealth with an early investment in the cellular service provider Nextel, which was sold to Sprint in 2005 for $35 billion. Mr. Warner then became a start-up investor at Columbia Capital, which had an office in Alexandria, Va. He used his fortune to run for governor of Virginia, talking on the campaign trail about bringing work force training and tech-oriented economic development to rural parts of the state. After serving a term, he was elected to the Senate in 2008.

And even with his recent criticism of the industry, he regularly taps a broad network of tech executives and investors for counsel.

During the summer, Steve Case, the founder of AOL, stayed at Mr. Warner’s vacation home on Martha’s Vineyard. For years, the two have met regularly to talk about techology-related policy issues, like how artificial intelligence could alter the future of labor.

But during this year’s trip, they discussed the Senate intelligence committee’s Russia investigation and the power of social media platforms and their role in the election.

“His thinking has evolved,” Mr. Case said. “Even though I’m sure this has some benefit with his profile, all things being equal, I think he has approached this with some reluctance because he’d rather be focused on issues like the future of work.”

And Mr. Warner sees no contradiction in his evolution to being considered a sharp prod of Silicon Valley.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — David Steinberg has come a long way from his New York Times Crossword debut as a 14-year-old in 2011 (for those of us over the age of 40, that would be last Thursday). He’s now a student at Stanford University and — in his spare time — edits the crossword puzzle for The Orange County Register.

He still has time to create crosswords for The Times, and Mr. Steinberg will be adding an additional crossword to his rotation.

“I’m now editing a daily 15x15 crossword for [the syndicator] Andrews-McMeel/Universal,” he reported. “The puzzles, which go live in a few weeks, will all be Tuesday-Wednesday New York Times difficulty, including two Wednesday level themelesses at the end of each week. Hope many of you will give them a try.”

Duly noted, Mr. Steinberg. And thank you for debuting both PINK VIAGRA and IT WAS A JOKE, because that just cracked me up. Kudos as well for debuting EVIL EMPIRE (how did that get past constructors?), DIARY ENTRY, LINKEDIN PROFILE and KRUSTY the clown from “The Simpsons.”

But as he left the witness stand and walked past the defense table, he shot Sergeant Bergdahl a withering glare.","“I’m admitting I made a horrible mistake,” the sergeant said on the witness stand. “It was never my intention for anyone to be hurt, and I never expected that to happen.”

As a candidate, Mr. Trump repeatedly called Sergeant Bergdahl a traitor and suggested that he should be executed or returned to the Taliban. On Oct. 16, Mr. Trump seemed to endorse those earlier sentiments, declining to say anything new about the case but adding, “I think people have heard my comments in the past.”

An Army investigator initially recommended that there be no jail time for Sergeant Bergdahl, who was held and tortured by the Taliban for five years. But anger — on the part of politicians and members of the military — over the sergeant’s actions may have contributed to the fact that he now faces the possibility of a long sentence.

In sentencing, mitigating factors weigh in favor of leniency while aggravating factors tip the scales toward harsher punishment. The judge’s decision means he will weigh Mr. Trump’s comments along with other mitigating factors presented by the defense, including evidence that Sergeant Bergdahl had a severe mental disorder and suffered torture in captivity.

Colonel Nance will also consider aggravating factors presented by the prosecution, including injuries suffered by several service members during the search for Sergeant Bergdahl, as well as the negative impact they say the search had on the military’s overall war effort in Afghanistan.

Anger over the injuries has driven much of the testimony in the case so far, as service members vividly described a rescue operation that exposed them to enemy fire. Shannon Allen, the wife of Sgt. First Class Mark Allen, who was shot in the head took the stand on Monday.

Sergeant Allen, a national guardsman from Georgia, had part of his brain removed during surgery, and is now unable to speak, walk, or take care of himself. His wife has said little publicly, but in a Facebook post after Sergeant Bergdahl was freed, she blamed him for causing her husband’s incapacitation.

“Instead of being his wife, I have become his caregiver,” Ms. Allen testified on Monday.

Last week, Staff Sgt. Jason Walters testified that his six-man team had only just arrived in Afghanistan when they were sent to search for Sergeant Bergdahl. They had little time to prepare for the rugged terrain of Paktika Province, and little intelligence to go on.

On the second morning of the search, “an insane amount of fire came out of nowhere,” Sergeant Walters said. Militants had them surrounded. In minutes, half the team had been wounded. Sergeant Walters turned to see “a cloud of blood” spraying from the head of Sergeant Allen.

“I started treating his wounds, talking to him, telling him to hang on,” Sergeant Walters said.

The battle subsided only after F-15 fighter jets and Apache helicopters arrived overhead.

Only later would the troops learn that the battalion responsible for the area believed that 150 Taliban fighters were near the village where the soldiers were resting when they came under fire.

“My words can’t take away what people have been through,” Sergeant Bergdahl told the court on Monday. “Offering condolences is not enough. People went through things they shouldn’t have had to go through. I grieve for those who have suffered and their families.”

The Army’s investigation of the rescue operation described faults with its planning, preparation, equipment and intelligence. Sergeant Bergdahl’s defense team has also argued to the judge that the Taliban — not their client — were directly responsible for Sergeant Allen’s wounds.

Prosecutors have sought to show that the attack would have played out similarly even without the problems cited. Increased risks were acceptable, they say, if the missing soldier was thought to be near.

But in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the investigation showed, some of Sergeant Allen’s comrades were upset with the officers who ordered the operation.

“We should have never went out there in the first place, and we would not have lost three of our guys in the process,” said Staff Sgt. Travis Scott Elmore, referring to the wounded. He was one of the six-member Embedded Training Team, or E.T.T. He had been told only afterward that the battalion responsible for that area believed there were 150 Taliban fighters nearby.

“We didn’t have the manpower, and that was the first mission that our E.T.T. team has ever conducted” with Afghan troops, he said in a sworn statement to Army investigators.

Sergeant Walters suggested that commanders never would have sent their own men from the battalion on such a high-risk patrol.

“They treat us like a redheaded stepchild whose only purpose there is to be used at their convenience and for the missions they don’t want to risk their own men on,” he wrote in his statement.

In court, Sergeant Bergdahl gave details about his captivity, saying that he had once used a nail sharpened with a rock to pick the locks on his shackles and escape. He had planned to subsist on grass, he said, but because the area was heavily populated by herds of sheep and goats, there was little available.

He fell off a cliff into a dry riverbed, he said. After eight days at large, he would “black out and fall over” when he tried to stand up.

When he was recaptured, the Taliban beat him and placed him in a cage that would be his home for the next four years, he said.

Another search for Sergeant Bergdahl, this one conducted at night, was recounted last week by Jimmy Hatch, who was a Senior Chief Petty Officer and member of a Navy SEAL special operations team. After helicopters dropped off his team, Chief Hatch sent his military working dog after two people he suspected were enemy fighters. One shot the dog in the head. The other sprayed his gun wildly.

The muzzle flashes allowed American troops to locate and kill the fighters — but not before one shot Chief Hatch, shattering his thighbone, he said. He would later have 18 surgical procedures, and still walks with a pronounced limp.

“I was worse than useless,” Chief Hatch said, recalling his fear that his screams might endanger fellow troops.

Specialist Jonathan Morita, whose finger bones shattered when an unexploded rocket-propelled grenade struck his hand, has regained only limited use of his hand.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Do you like movie trivia? Ross Trudeau returns to test our mettle.

Today’s Theme

Four famous lines from well-known movies are offered in the grid, clued with just the titles: Your job is to match them to the actors who said them. Those entries are also part of the theme: CRUISE LINE (59A), for example, is the answer to the SHOW ME THE MONEY (42A) line from “Jerry Maguire.” It’s also a real phrase in its own right, and is clued as “Carnival, say, or a further hint to 42-Across.”

Tricky Clues

6A: Is it GIF with a hard G or a soft G? No one knows for sure, although it’s said that because the G stands for “graphics,” which has a hard G, GIF should be pronounced that way. Either way, surely we have better things to argue about.

13A: “Canine supporters” could be all the wonderful rescue organizations that abound (Like Elayne Boosler’s Tails of Joy ), but today we’re talking teeth, so the answer is GUMS.

30A: Get to know your hockey moves! A DEKE, which is a fake-out on the ice, comes up every now and then and is worth knowing.

71A: Nice wordplay! “What I may turn into” is not really about Mr. Trudeau morphing into something. It’s about what the word “I” could become, and that’s the ROYAL WE.

17D: TIL that “metathesiophobia” is the fear of CHANGE. And I hope it stays that way.

Constructor Notes

A couple thoughts: 1. ""Going Off Script” includes four white actors. Moreover, the SHOW ME THE MONEY line was also spoken by Cuba Gooding Jr., a black actor who goes uncredited in this puzzle (despite upstaging Tom Cruise). 2. “Going Off Script” also comprises four male actors. The original version did include WOODLINE/I FEEL PRETTY OH SO PRETTY, which got axed because it yielded asymmetric themers. But then again, Natalie Wood, an American with Russian parents, was cast to play Maria, a Puerto Rican. Dios. Aside from Ms. Wood, I only found revealers that referenced white males (PENNLINE, CRYSTALLINE, SHORTLINE), let alone ones that matched with legitimately iconic movie quotes. So, open question: If Hollywood’s gender/race representation problem means that, after an honest effort, you only can find white male actors for your ___LINE puzzle, do you scrap it? Is doing otherwise cynical and opportunistic? Is the choice mitigated if you subsequently construct an UZI GAL GODOT puzzle? ( Very interested in collaborating on that puzzle. Let’s chat.)

Food for thought, Mr. Trudeau.

There are so many good musical choices in this puzzle, but I’ve got to end our solving week with this one:

“They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said.

In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets. If I, with my limited funds and square footage, had devoted a room — albeit a very small one — to my furry friends, what kinds of over-the-top spaces were animal enthusiasts with larger budgets creating for their pets?

With a little research, I discovered such efforts could range from a living room wall transformed into a cat jungle gym to an entire studio apartment dedicated to a family of pets, including three parrots, a feral cat and a 35-year-old tortoise. Many animal lovers in New York and beyond, it seems, think nothing of the cost involved in creating a special space for their pets — even when that sort of customization might cut into the profits when it comes time to sell their homes.

Hunt Slonem, an artist celebrated for his whimsical paintings of animals (particularly bunnies), carved 1,200 square feet out of his 30,000-square-foot studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for his bird family.

Mr. Slonem has kept birds as pets for most of his life, and he currently has about 60 of them, all rescues, including a 75-year-old macaw called Sebastian and a cockatoo named Clyde that follows him everywhere.

The space he has devoted to the birds features dozens of suspended cages, often left open so the birds can fly free, and tile imported from Nicaragua that Mr. Slonem said helps to “define the space and stylishly conceal the droppings.”

Inside this indoor avian community, Mr. Slonem’s birds are free to talk, spat and mate — some for life, as they see fit. The space is so open and accommodating that many of the more social birds, including a close-knit clique of Amazon parrots, make regular house calls to each other’s cages. Feeding the birds, which takes up to five hours a day, requires the full-time services of a professional bird minder who has worked for Mr. Slonem for 35 years and who serves them a fresh salad of leafy greens, melons, bananas, grapes and tofu.

In Mr. Slonem’s latest book, “Birds,” he describes them as his muses and confidantes. He regularly paints among them, and whenever he is within earshot of the aviary, he said, the birds begin to chant his name in unison. “They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said. “And they have huge personalities. They’re my dear friends, a relief from the humdrum of life.”

While Mr. Slonem shares his sprawling studio with the birds, he hasn’t given up any of his own living space. But other New Yorkers have.

In New York by Gehry building in Manhattan, Lucy Swift Weber’s 10-year-old Yorkie, Chauncey, is recovering from cancer. When things got particularly rough last year, Ms. Weber decided to convert the guest bedroom in her two-bedroom apartment into Chauncey’s room, to “give him the space to heal.”

Photo

Along with an en-suite bathroom — good for quick water refills and easy cleanup — the dog’s bedroom has a set of customized pet stairs, a plush floor-pillow lounge and a six-foot-tall headboard that Ms. Weber upholstered in a fabric she designed herself. “It’s become this warm, comfortable world where Chauncey can relax and rehabilitate,” Ms. Weber said. “I tried to make the room both calming and cheerful enough that he would want to spend time there, and it worked. He’s in there all of the time by choice.”

But even once he is in better health, Ms. Weber said, Chauncey will continue to have a room of his own; she and her boyfriend just moved into a larger, three-bedroom apartment on another floor of the same building, so that her boyfriend’s college-age sons won’t have to sleep in Chauncey’s room when they visit.

Caroline Stern, who owns three condos on the same floor of her building on Central Park West, went a step further and dedicated an entire 650-square-foot studio to her pets, where they can sleep and roam free when they’re not with her.

Next door to Ms. Stern’s apartment, the pet condo is home to three parrots — Apricot, Sinbad and Roxanne (a Moluccan cockatoo that serves as an emotional support animal) — a feral cat named Butch and an Russian tortoise named Alberta.

To accommodate these animals, Ms. Stern filled the condo with hand-built oversized aviaries, towering bird trees and an ultraviolet-lighted reptile area with a special water bath for Alberta. “Birds are loud,” Ms. Stern said. “It’s comforting to have a soothing place to put them when I can’t deal with the screaming.”

Ms. Stern’s neighbors are more than aware of her pet condo, but for the most part, she said, they are more charmed than perturbed. “It’s an animal-friendly building,” she said. “People stop by to visit; they know they’re lucky pets.”

Such devotion raises an obvious question: When designing extravagant spaces for pets, is property value even worth taking into consideration? As adorable as some of these animal rooms are, they often come at a hefty real estate cost.

“Whether it’s for a person or a parrot, customizing a property always makes it more difficult to sell,” said Ryan Serhant, of Nest Seeker’s Serhant Team. “An animal-dedicated space makes it even more challenging, because they often leave behind lingering smells and damaged surfaces that scare prospective buyers into thinking they’d have to renovate.”

There are, however, less expensive and less intrusive ways to create inviting pet habitats.

In Penfield, N.Y., Jill Sanders sacrificed a single wall in her 15-foot-wide living room to accommodate Nadia, a one-year-old Siberian cat she has been fostering for the last seven months and plans to adopt. Three months ago, when Mrs. Sanders decided to bring home two puppies, she knew she would have to get creative to keep Nadia comfortable. So she called on Mike Wilson and Megan Hanneman, founders of Catastrophic Creations, to devise a dedicated space for Nadia along the living room wall, where the cat could play and escape from the dogs when necessary.

More than 10 feet tall and five feet off the ground, the cat playground is composed of several floating sisal post steps, scratching posts, landing shelves, canvas hammocks and a rope bridge. “Everyone that sees it is blown away by its design-savviness,” Mrs. Sanders said. “I just wanted to give her something that brought her as much joy as she brings our family.”

And in Chicago, Guita Griffiths enlisted the help of Shelley Johnstone, of Shelley Johnstone Design, to create a practical but comforting place for Margaux, her 70-pound yellow Labrador retriever, in her 110-square-foot mudroom.

“Margaux’s a big dog,” Mrs. Griffiths said. “We needed a space to keep her when guests came over, where she wouldn’t feel trapped or anxious.” The result is a 5-by-8-foot space devoted entirely to the 3-year-old dog.

Along with luxuries like heated marble floors, an overstuffed dog bed and canine-printed wallpaper, the room has a spacious sink for Margaux’s baths, storage for her leashes and toys, and a Dutch door, so she can be shut inside without feeling claustrophobic.

And why not?

As Mrs. Griffiths said, “Margaux is just like any other member of our family.”","A Bedroom for Rover, Maybe Even a Condo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/a-bedroom-for-rover-maybe-even-a-condo.html

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

“My words can’t take away what people have been through,” Sergeant Bergdahl told the court on Monday.
Sergeant Walters suggested that commanders never would have sent their own men from the battalion on such a high-risk patrol.
But as he left the witness stand and walked past the defense table, he shot Sergeant Bergdahl a withering glare.","“I’m admitting I made a horrible mistake,” the sergeant said on the witness stand. “It was never my intention for anyone to be hurt, and I never expected that to happen.”

As a candidate, Mr. Trump repeatedly called Sergeant Bergdahl a traitor and suggested that he should be executed or returned to the Taliban. On Oct. 16, Mr. Trump seemed to endorse those earlier sentiments, declining to say anything new about the case but adding, “I think people have heard my comments in the past.”

An Army investigator initially recommended that there be no jail time for Sergeant Bergdahl, who was held and tortured by the Taliban for five years. But anger — on the part of politicians and members of the military — over the sergeant’s actions may have contributed to the fact that he now faces the possibility of a long sentence.

In sentencing, mitigating factors weigh in favor of leniency while aggravating factors tip the scales toward harsher punishment. The judge’s decision means he will weigh Mr. Trump’s comments along with other mitigating factors presented by the defense, including evidence that Sergeant Bergdahl had a severe mental disorder and suffered torture in captivity.

Colonel Nance will also consider aggravating factors presented by the prosecution, including injuries suffered by several service members during the search for Sergeant Bergdahl, as well as the negative impact they say the search had on the military’s overall war effort in Afghanistan.

Anger over the injuries has driven much of the testimony in the case so far, as service members vividly described a rescue operation that exposed them to enemy fire. Shannon Allen, the wife of Sgt. First Class Mark Allen, who was shot in the head took the stand on Monday.

Sergeant Allen, a national guardsman from Georgia, had part of his brain removed during surgery, and is now unable to speak, walk, or take care of himself. His wife has said little publicly, but in a Facebook post after Sergeant Bergdahl was freed, she blamed him for causing her husband’s incapacitation.

“Instead of being his wife, I have become his caregiver,” Ms. Allen testified on Monday.

Last week, Staff Sgt. Jason Walters testified that his six-man team had only just arrived in Afghanistan when they were sent to search for Sergeant Bergdahl. They had little time to prepare for the rugged terrain of Paktika Province, and little intelligence to go on.

On the second morning of the search, “an insane amount of fire came out of nowhere,” Sergeant Walters said. Militants had them surrounded. In minutes, half the team had been wounded. Sergeant Walters turned to see “a cloud of blood” spraying from the head of Sergeant Allen.

“I started treating his wounds, talking to him, telling him to hang on,” Sergeant Walters said.

The battle subsided only after F-15 fighter jets and Apache helicopters arrived overhead.

Only later would the troops learn that the battalion responsible for the area believed that 150 Taliban fighters were near the village where the soldiers were resting when they came under fire.

“My words can’t take away what people have been through,” Sergeant Bergdahl told the court on Monday. “Offering condolences is not enough. People went through things they shouldn’t have had to go through. I grieve for those who have suffered and their families.”

The Army’s investigation of the rescue operation described faults with its planning, preparation, equipment and intelligence. Sergeant Bergdahl’s defense team has also argued to the judge that the Taliban — not their client — were directly responsible for Sergeant Allen’s wounds.

Prosecutors have sought to show that the attack would have played out similarly even without the problems cited. Increased risks were acceptable, they say, if the missing soldier was thought to be near.

But in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the investigation showed, some of Sergeant Allen’s comrades were upset with the officers who ordered the operation.

“We should have never went out there in the first place, and we would not have lost three of our guys in the process,” said Staff Sgt. Travis Scott Elmore, referring to the wounded. He was one of the six-member Embedded Training Team, or E.T.T. He had been told only afterward that the battalion responsible for that area believed there were 150 Taliban fighters nearby.

“We didn’t have the manpower, and that was the first mission that our E.T.T. team has ever conducted” with Afghan troops, he said in a sworn statement to Army investigators.

Sergeant Walters suggested that commanders never would have sent their own men from the battalion on such a high-risk patrol.

“They treat us like a redheaded stepchild whose only purpose there is to be used at their convenience and for the missions they don’t want to risk their own men on,” he wrote in his statement.

In court, Sergeant Bergdahl gave details about his captivity, saying that he had once used a nail sharpened with a rock to pick the locks on his shackles and escape. He had planned to subsist on grass, he said, but because the area was heavily populated by herds of sheep and goats, there was little available.

He fell off a cliff into a dry riverbed, he said. After eight days at large, he would “black out and fall over” when he tried to stand up.

When he was recaptured, the Taliban beat him and placed him in a cage that would be his home for the next four years, he said.

Another search for Sergeant Bergdahl, this one conducted at night, was recounted last week by Jimmy Hatch, who was a Senior Chief Petty Officer and member of a Navy SEAL special operations team. After helicopters dropped off his team, Chief Hatch sent his military working dog after two people he suspected were enemy fighters. One shot the dog in the head. The other sprayed his gun wildly.

The muzzle flashes allowed American troops to locate and kill the fighters — but not before one shot Chief Hatch, shattering his thighbone, he said. He would later have 18 surgical procedures, and still walks with a pronounced limp.

“I was worse than useless,” Chief Hatch said, recalling his fear that his screams might endanger fellow troops.

Specialist Jonathan Morita, whose finger bones shattered when an unexploded rocket-propelled grenade struck his hand, has regained only limited use of his hand.

Specialist Morita testified that he suffers from a short temper because of his experience. He said his anger is directed “toward one person.”

He did not name names. But as he left the witness stand and walked past the defense table, he shot Sergeant Bergdahl a withering glare.",Sgt. Bergdahl’s Sentence May Be Lighter Because of Trump’s Comments,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/bowe-bergdahl-search-attack.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“If I’m like a field, I must be a field,” she says with annoyance, as he tries to explain the comparison. But the metaphor — or rather, the very idea of metaphor — lodges in her imagination. And she finds herself increasingly hungry for words that would capture the ineluctable — a puddle that’s clear instead of muddy, the shaking of leaves on a tree — in a landscape where “things change every day.”

On an errand for her husband, she meets the play’s third character, Gilbert Horn (Devin E. Haqq), the miller, who is both necessary to and despised by the crop-tending villagers. Gilbert owns books and, more important, a pen. And when the woman takes that pen in her hands, it seems to acquire a frenzied will of its own.

Mr. Takacs and his movement director, Yasmine Lee, who previously collaborated to haunting effect on Philip Ridley’s “Tender Napalm,” give expressive life to the physical relationships among these characters. There are a few moments in which the staging is confusing in conveying plot twists, although a lyrical ambiguity often feels appropriate.

The production is punctuated by a series of erotic pas de deux that suggest the satisfactions and limitations of sex. They are enacted, fittingly, within the claustrophobic confines of Steven C. Kemp’s rustic wooden set, lighted with hints of a mysterious world beyond by Dante Olivia Smith.

Dressed in rough garments (by Sydney Gallas) that evoke the early days of the Western frontier, the cast speaks in largely uninflected American accents (though Ms. Kerr is identified as Jamaican Scottish in her program biography). The performances are precisely focused without being intensely emotional.

Nonetheless, the sum effect of their talk and actions is deeply emotional. “I have no name for the thing which is in my head,” the Young Woman says at one point, with a wondering greed.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle was constructed in October 2016 and accepted for publication in February of this year. It is one of a series of open grids that I constructed in the late summer and fall of 2016. This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

By the end of the year, the Maccioni family is likely to be without a restaurant base of operations in New York. They have just announced that Circo, formally known as Osteria del Circo, their West 55th Street restaurant, will close after dinner on Sunday. It was known for its lively circus décor by Adam Tihany and as a showcase for some of the recipes of Egidiana Maccioni, the wife of the patriarch, Sirio Maccioni.

Mauro Maccioni, one of the Maccioni sons, said the decision to close had to do with a dispute with the landlord that they could not resolve. The Maccionis are looking to relocate the restaurant nearby and make it a more rustic, Tuscan place. Circo is Italian for “circus,” a play on the name of their flagship. Le Cirque, which is circus in French.

The Maccionis also plan to close Le Cirque at the end of the year and expect to relocate it, too. In previous years, each of the times they moved Le Cirque, first from its original location on East 65th Street to the New York Palace Hotel and then to its current address in the Bloomberg Tower, they had Circo as a fallback for regular customers while Le Cirque was closed. Circo, which opened in 1996, has been a popular destination, especially for theatergoers.

It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted.

At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers.

On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans.

Health care sabotage.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts.

AFTER THE ECLIPSE

A Mother’s Murder, a Daughter’s Search

By Sarah Perry

350 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $27.

In the early morning of May 12, 1994, in a small inland town in Maine, Sarah Perry’s 30-year-old mother, Crystal, was stabbed to death in her home, while Sarah, who was 12 at the time and lived alone with her mother, sat frozen on her bed on the other side of a thin wall. The murder, which went unsolved for 12 years, marked Perry, infecting her with a “viscous blackness” unleashed by the killer’s act. Like the partial solar eclipse Perry and her mother witnessed two nights before the murder, this blackness blotted out the daughter’s and the mother’s former selves. “After the Eclipse” is Perry’s effort to look behind this shadow. But it also reveals much more: a town plagued by violence, addiction and generational poverty; a culture of women taught to need men who were often ill equipped to love them; and the courage and compassion required to not merely survive the worst thing imaginable but to make a kind of terrible sense of it.

“A violent act is an epicenter; it shakes everyone within reach and creates other stories, cracks open the earth and reveals buried secrets. I want those stories, those secrets.” So Perry explains her decision five years after the conviction of her mother’s murderer to search through the extensive police files gathered during the investigation. There she finds “ardent letters” between her mother and the college-student boyfriend who spun her in and out like a yo-yo, and rumors of the men who shared her mother’s bed and the ones who wanted to. There is the calendar from their kitchen wall documenting movies seen and hikes taken, and the underwear her mother wore that night, purchased oversize in “a funny sort of modesty.” Perry learns of an investigator’s suspicions of her — “Mother may have been an embarrassment to her. She may have wished it happened” — and the assessment of a social worker after meeting her family the morning after the murder: “They were all losers.” To this, Perry adds dozens of her own interviews, the extensive news coverage, her personal archives and those of her family and friends, along with her memories to complete this entirely different but equally pressing investigation.

“After the Eclipse” pulls the reader swiftly along on parallel tracks of mystery and elegy. Early on, Perry dispels any question of whether her mother hastened her own death through her choices in men or her behavior, but she withholds who actually killed her mother until almost the end. The chapters alternate between Perry’s mother’s life — beginning with a childhood characterized by neglect, alcoholism and violence and her escape at 15 into a marriage to Perry’s father that brought more of the same — and Perry’s own life after her mother’s death, as she struggles to be a “normal kid” in a series of loveless homes amid an ongoing murder investigation that treats her as both suspect and potential next victim.

It’s a rhythm that builds suspense, which in other hands might feel prurient, but Perry’s scrupulous research and painstaking rendering of her experiences make her a trustworthy guide through such emotionally charged terrain. She’s also a wonderful writer with an assured sense of when to zoom in to her body’s somatic response for a piercing immediacy and when to pull back to convey the measured perspective gained through the distance of time. Many moments of beauty and tenderness rise up through the darkness.

In the end, Perry succeeds in restoring her mother’s humanity, and her own. Crystal Perry was a hard worker who saved enough money from her job sewing the topstitching onto leather moccasins at a local factory to purchase a car and home and provide for her child. She was a free-spirited, redheaded beauty prone to “car dancing” and hot-tempered men who couldn’t give her the love she sought. She was a creative, energetic and loving mother who raised a very talented and remarkable daughter.","In ‘After the Eclipse,’ a Daughter Mourns Her Murdered Mother",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/books/review/after-the-eclipse-sarah-perry-memoir-tribute.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Ms. King was taking several dance classes a week and practicing yoga, and she thought the stress of these activities might be causing the pain in her tight, inflexible back. But after a number of Feldenkrais sessions, she told Ms. Ramin, “I realized that the pain had more to do with the way I carried myself every day.”

Even after just one session, I understood what she meant. When I make a point of walking upright and fluid, sitting straight, even cooking relaxed and unhurried, I have no pain. The slow, gentle, repetitive movements I practiced in a Feldenkrais group class helped foster an awareness of how I use my body in relation to my environment, and awareness is the first step to changing one’s behavior.

One common problem of which I’m often guilty is using small muscles to accomplish tasks meant for large, heavy-duty ones, resulting in undue fatigue and pain.

The group class, called Awareness Through Movement, was followed by an individual session called Functional Integration with a therapist that helped to free tight muscles and joints that were limiting my motion and increasing my discomfort. Using gentle manipulation and passive movements, the therapist individualized his approach to my particular needs.

The ultimate goal of both sessions is, in effect, to retrain the brain – to establish new neural pathways that result in easy, simple movements that are physiologically effective and comfortable. Although the Feldenkrais method was developed in the mid-20th century, neurophysiologists have since demonstrated the plasticity of the brain, its ability to form new cells, reorganize itself and, in effect, learn new ways to do things.

The beauty of Feldenkrais lessons is that they are both relatively low-cost (group classes average $15 to $25, individual sessions $100 to $200) and potentially accessible to nearly everyone. There are more than 7,000 teachers and practitioners working in 18 countries, including large numbers in the United States. You can be any age, strength, fitness level and state of well-being to participate. The exercises are slow, gentle and adjustable to whatever might ail you. Their calming effect counters the stress that results in contracted muscles, tightness and pain.

Feldenkrais practitioners like Marek Wyszynski, director of the New York center, typically start professional life as physical therapists. They then undergo three years of training to become certified in the Feldenkrais method.

Mr. Wyszynski explained that he starts by observing how patients are using their skeletons – how they sit, stand and walk in ways that may cause or contribute to their pathology, be it spinal disc disease, arthritis, shoulder pain or damaged knee joints. In accordance with Dr. Feldenkrais’s astute observation, “If you don’t know what you are doing, you can’t do what you want,” patients are then given a clear sensory experience of how their posture and behavior contribute to their pain and physical limitations.

For example, some people may use excessive force, clench their teeth, hold their breath or rush, causing undue muscle tension and skeletal stress. Years ago, I realized that my frequent headaches resulted from an unconscious habit of clenching my jaw when I concentrated intently on a task like sewing or cooking. Feldenkrais teachers do not give formulas for a proper way of behaving; rather, they rely on their patients’ ability to self-discover and self-correct.

Once aware of their counterproductive habits, students are given the opportunity to experience alternative movements, postures and behaviors and, through practice, create new habits that are less likely to cause pain.

Mr. Wyszynski told me that there are more than 1,000 distinct Feldenkrais lessons currently available, most of which involve everyday actions like reaching, getting up from a chair, turning, bending and walking.

As a mechanical engineer and physicist, Dr. Feldenkrais understood that the job of the human skeleton was to accommodate the effects of gravity in order to remain upright. And he wanted people to achieve this in the most efficient way possible.

Using two tall foam cylinders, one perched on top of the other, Mr. Wyszynski demonstrated a guiding principle of the Feldenkrais method. When the top cylinder was centered on the bottom one, it stood in place without assistance. But when it was off center, perched near the edge of the bottom cylinder, it tipped over. If instead of cylinders these were someone’s skeletal parts that were askew, tightened muscles would have to keep the patient from falling over.

As Mr. Wyszynski explained, “Good posture allows the skeleton to hold up and support the body without expending unnecessary energy despite the pull of gravity. However, with poor posture, the muscles are doing part of the job of the bones, and with poor skeletal support, the muscles have to remain contracted to prevent the body from falling.”",Trying the Feldenkrais Method for Chronic Pain,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/well/trying-the-feldenkrais-method-for-chronic-pain.html

Ms. Hasegawa tackles that question in “Japanorama.” Having previously presented Japanese contemporary art in Brazil, Britain and Germany, she “looked very carefully at the past 10-15 years: what was organized, what kind of Japanese contemporary art has been collected in public institutions in Europe.” She continued: “I want to bring awareness to context behind what people misunderstand, to the social commentary behind the works.”

Ms. Hasegawa’s vast and thoughtful synopsis encompasses six themes (called “archipelagos”) that bridge art, architecture, video, fashion and music. She porously connects movements and multimedia across two floors, with a mise-en-scène conceived by the Tokyo architects SANAA.

The first section, “Strange Object/Post-Human Body,” confronts visitors with “Electric Dress,” a multicolored cluster of lights, created in 1956 by Atsuko Tanaka, that prefigures today’s evolving relationship between the physical and the digital. The piece resonates with Comme des Garçons garments on display, which present an alternative approach to Western ideas of beauty and body image.

Within the Pop Art sphere, Ms. Hasegawa has highlighted works with a strong conceptual background and Japanese specificity. She wishes to undercut the way in which Japanese pop culture is often understood as sunny or silly: The graphic kitsch is, in fact, inherently critical, she says. “It’s vernacular — but also very sophisticated,” she added. The artist Takashi Murakami’s work in this vein, is perhaps the most well-known, but it is also the most misunderstood. The painted smileys of his “Cosmos” are not just bright and fun — the composition owes everything to 18th-century Edo paintings. His lesser-known “Polyrhythm Red” canvas, adorned with Tamiya soldier figurines, reflects, Ms. Hasegawa said, “Japanese culture becoming childish,” and a malaise about violence and vulnerability.

The exhibition also overturns the seeming naïveté of “kawaii,” Japan’s signature brand of cute, to reveal assertions of sociopolitical frustration. A 2002 kimono using Bingata, the traditional dyed fabric of Okinawa — where the artist Yuken Teruya grew up, near a United States Army base — is especially striking. The cheery flowers and trees on the garment are, upon closer inspection, composed of fighter planes and parachutes.

The exhibition concludes with a section on “Materiality and Minimalism,” highlighting examples such as Hiroshi Sugimoto’s calm photographs of horizon lines and Ryoji Ikeda’s trancelike work based on numerical data. “It’s a landing,” Ms. Hasegawa said of the exhibition’s finale, to “look at something sublime.”

Kohei Nawa’s breathtaking “Force,” an installation of viscous black silicone oil, which rains down without making a splash, appears soothing, but this is deceptive: Its subject is radioactive fallout. Like many works in “Japanorama,” it shows that simple does not mean straightforward, that beautiful things can contain disquieting fears.

To grapple with these nuances requires being open to another perspective. In this sense, the show’s most emblematic piece is by the artist Shimabuku. His video “Then, I Decided to Give a Tour of Tokyo to the Octopus from Akashi,” is as gently funny as it is affecting. He collects an octopus from his hometown and brings it to the metropolis on the bullet train — takes it to the fish market, introduces it to another octopus there — and eventually releases it back into the sea. It’s a fitting narrative for visitors to the exhibition, who, at the end, are returned to their usual setting, more enlightened for having explored an unfamiliar territory.","Japanese Art, on Its Own Terms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/design/japanese-art-on-its-own-terms.html

Wounded Knee was the scene of the last major conflict of the American Indian Wars, in which 350 Lakota men, women and children were massacred by United States troops in 1890.

While his protests won some government concessions and drew national attention and wide sympathy for the deplorable social and economic conditions of American Indians, Mr. Banks achieved few real improvements in the daily lives of millions of Native Americans, who live on reservations and in major cities and lag behind most fellow citizens in jobs, housing and education.

To admirers, Mr. Banks was a broad-chested champion of native pride. With dark, piercing eyes, high cheekbones, a jutting chin and long raven hair, he was a paladin who defied authority and, in an era crowded with civil rights protests, spoke for the nation’s oldest minority.

To his critics, including many American Indians, Mr. Banks was a self-promoter, grabbing headlines and becoming a darling of politically liberal Hollywood stars like Jane Fonda and Marlon Brando. His severest detractors, including law-enforcement officials, said he let followers risk injury and arrest while he jumped bail to avoid a long prison sentence and did not surrender for nearly a decade.

Mr. Banks and Mr. Means first won national attention for declaring a “Day of Mourning” for Native Americans on Thanksgiving Day in 1970. Their band seized the ship Mayflower II, a replica of the original in Plymouth, Mass., and a televised confrontation between real Indians and costumed “Pilgrims” made the American Indian Movement leaders overnight heroes.

In 1972, the two organized cross-country car caravans on “Trails of Broken Treaties.” They converged on Washington with 500 followers to protest Indian living standards and lost treaty rights, occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs and held out for nearly a week, destroying documents and the premises, until the government agreed to discuss Indian grievances and review treaty commitments.

In 1973, after a white man killed an Indian in a saloon brawl and was charged not with murder but with involuntary manslaughter, Mr. Banks led 200 American Indian Movement protesters in a face-off with the police in Custer, S.D. It became a riot when the slain man’s mother was beaten by officers. After he left town, Mr. Banks, who said he had merely tried to ease tensions, was charged with assault and rioting.

It was the last straw. “We had reached a point in history where we could not tolerate the abuse any longer, where mothers could not tolerate the mistreatment that goes on on the reservations any longer, where they could not see another Indian youngster die,” he told the author Peter Matthiessen.

Weeks later, the siege that made Mr. Banks and Mr. Means famous across America began when 200 Oglala Lakota and A.I.M. followers with rifles and shotguns occupied Wounded Knee. About 300 United States marshals, F.B.I. agents and other law-enforcement officials cordoned off the area with armored cars and heavy weapons, touching off a 10-week battle of nerves and gunfire.

Amid wide news media coverage, the significance of the battlefield was not lost on many Americans. Dee Brown’s best-selling book “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West” (1970) had recently explored the record of massacres and atrocities against Native Americans on the expanding frontier, undermining one of the nation’s fondest myths.

Proclaiming a willingness to die for their cause, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means demanded the ouster of Richard Wilson, the elected leader of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, whom they called a corrupt white man’s stooge. The government refused. Shootings punctuated the days of stalemate, leaving wounded on both sides. Two Indians were killed, and a federal agent was shot and paralyzed.

When it was over, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means were charged with assault and conspiracy. After a federal trial, with the defense raising historic and current Indian grievances, a judge dismissed the case for prosecutorial misconduct, including illegal wiretaps and evidence that had been tampered with.

By then, Mr. Banks was a pre-eminent spokesman for Native Americans. He mediated armed conflicts between Indians and the authorities in various states. But his own legal troubles were not over.

Charged with riot and assault with a deadly weapon for his role in the 1973 melee in Custer, he was found guilty in 1975. Facing up to 15 years in prison, he jumped bail and fled to California.

With 1.4 million signatures on a petition supporting Mr. Banks, Gov. Jerry Brown granted him asylum in 1976, rejecting extradition to South Dakota by saying his life might be in danger if he were sent back. Mr. Banks later became chancellor of Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University, a small two-year college for Indians in Davis, Calif.

Deprived of California sanctuary when Governor Brown was succeeded by a Republican, George Deukmejian, in early 1983, Mr. Banks found a new refuge on an Onondaga reservation near Syracuse. Federal officials said he would be arrested only if he left the reservation. But in 1984, weary of his confined life, he returned to South Dakota voluntarily and was sentenced to three years in prison.

Paroled in 1985 after serving only 14 months, he moved to the Pine Ridge Reservation to work as a drug addiction and alcoholism counselor. He also turned his life around, embracing sobriety, giving talks on public service and organizing cross-country events that he called Sacred Runs, which became popular among supporters of Native Americans in later years.

“We were the prophets, the messengers, the fire starters,” Mr. Banks said in an autobiography, “Ojibwa Warrior: Dennis Banks and the Rise of the American Indian Movement” (2005, with Richard Erdoes). “Wounded Knee awakened not only the conscience of all Native Americans, but also of white Americans nationwide.”

Dennis James Banks was born on the Leech Lake Reservation on April 12, 1937. He never knew his father. His mother abandoned him to his grandparents.

When he was 5, he was taken from his family and sent to a series of government schools for Indians that systematically denigrated his Ojibwa (Chippewa) culture, language and identity. He ran away often, until, at 17, he returned to Leech Lake.

Unable to find work, he joined the Air Force and was stationed in Japan, where he married a Japanese woman, had a child with her and went absent without leave. Arrested and returned to the United States, he never saw his wife or child again. After being discharged, he moved to Minneapolis, drifted into crime, was arrested in a burglary and went to jail for two and a half years.

Released in 1968, he founded the American Indian Movement with an Ojibwa he had met in prison, Clyde Bellecourt, and others to fight the oppression and endemic poverty of Native Americans. He became chairman and national director as the group, based in Minneapolis, forged alliances and grew rapidly. After two years it said it had 25,000 members.

Within a year A.I.M., with its flair for guerrilla tactics, joined a lengthy occupation of Alcatraz Island, the former federal prison site in San Francisco Bay.

After his fugitive years, Mr. Banks had a modest movie career. He had roles in Franc Roddam’s “War Party” (1988), Michael Apted’s “Thunderheart” (1992), Michael Mann’s “The Last of the Mohicans” (1992, with Russell Means), and Georgina Lightning’s “Older Than America” (2008), which explored the devastating effects of Indian boarding schools like those Mr. Banks had been forced to attend.

Mr. Banks also appeared in documentaries: “We Shall Remain, Part V: Wounded Knee” (2009), a Ric Burns “American Experience” television film directed by Stanley Nelson; “A Good Day to Die” (2010), directed by David Mueller and Lynn Salt; and “Nowa Cumig: The Drum Will Never Stop” (2011), directed by Marie-Michele Jasmin-Belisle.

Besides his wife and child in Japan, Mr. Banks had many children with other women. In addition to Ms. Banks Rama, he is survived by 19 children, 11 with the surname Banks: Janice, Darla, Deanna, Dennis, Red Elk, Tatanka, Minoh, Tokala, Tiopa, Tacanunpa and Arrow. The others are Glenda Roberts, Beverly Baribeau, Kevin Strong, D. J. Nelson-Banks, Bryan Graves, and Pearl, Denise and Kawlija Blanchard. Mr. Banks is also survived by more than 100 grandchildren, Ms. Banks Rama said.

Mr. Banks was the 2016 vice presidential nominee of the California Peace and Freedom Party, which identified itself as socialist and feminist. The party’s presidential candidate was Gloria La Riva. As a single-state ticket, they won 66,000 votes.

In recent years, Mr. Banks lived with some of his children in Kentucky and Minnesota. He was an honorary trustee of the Leech Lake Tribal College, a two-year public institution in Cass Lake, Minn. Mr. Means, who also appeared in movies and wrote a memoir, died on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 2012 at age 72.

In 1990, both men joined a ceremony at the Pine Ridge Reservation commemorating the centenary of the Wounded Knee massacre.

“Maybe we opened up some eyes, opened some doors,” Mr. Banks told The Los Angeles Times. “And it was at least an educational process here.

I’ve been to Ireland many times and spent a summer there as a Times correspondent. What’s more, my mother was from a County Galway crossroads about 35 miles from Tuam. But it didn’t take long for me to be reminded, yet again, that the chasm of presumption and misunderstanding between Irish America and Ireland is as deep as the Atlantic.

Just to understand the history of the stone building that served as the mother and baby home required that I learn more about the development of mid-19th century workhouses, the local impact of the famine known as the Great Hunger, and the Irish war for independence (as well as the civil strife that followed).

But as Conall Ó Fátharta, an investigative reporter for The Irish Examiner, repeatedly told me, the case’s implications extended well beyond the eternal whereabouts of hundreds of children who died at the Tuam home. There had been other mother and baby homes around the country, all connected to what many historians say was part of a system that subjugated vulnerable women — a system that also included the notorious institutions known as the Magdalen Laundries.

And what of the children they were often forced to abandon? There were many more deaths, shadowy adoptions, medical experiments and painful marginalization. To this day, many adult “home babies” are trying to learn what happened to their mothers.

I was paralyzed: The story seemed too complex to be contained in even in an uncommonly long newspaper article. In total, I would interview about three dozen people, but still I needed someone to lead me — and the reader — through this maze of distant and modern Ireland.

Of course, she was right in front of me: Ms. Corless, that woman with no credentials, a gardener and grandmother whose determination had unearthed a troubling part of the past and forced a national reckoning.

I spent several days with the shy Ms. Corless, who patiently recounted her reporting. Tracking down archival documents and maps. Conducting dozens of interviews. Refusing to accept pat answers from those in power. Ms. Corless told me that she was motivated by the thought of all those children who deserved to be remembered. Ireland, she said, owed them at least that.

As I sat in her kitchen one day, sipping tea and eating a slice of apple tart, Ms. Corless answered a number of telephone calls from adult “home babies” now trying to track down relatives. She shared the information she had, promised to do more digging, and was, without fail, patient, even comforting.

Your wife is still angry with you, still feels aggrieved and mistrustful. You’ve gone to counseling, but she hasn’t reconciled herself to a husband who, early in a marriage, was swapping sexual pics with another woman. You think she’s being unpleasantly manipulative; she may think she’s reminding you that you’re on probation, that you have further to go to earn back her trust.

It’s often said that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. In this case, your marriage is now on its sickbed. One issue here is how much you and your wife value it. That’s hard for an outsider to assess. Anger, like love, isn’t a voluntary emotion; you can’t simply decide to dial it up or down. But surely your wife isn’t the only angry spouse in your marriage. You say you felt emotionally abused by your wife even during the affair (a serious complaint); you think your relationship isn’t healthy, “but it’s what I’ve got” — not exactly a Hallmark sentiment. Do you truly think that getting rid of those pics would fix what’s wrong here? If your counselor made a list of what was rotten in your marriage, I doubt your wife’s vengeful lock screen would make the Top 10.

I have been divorced for many years. My ex-husband is now married to a dentist. As part of our divorce agreement, I am responsible for the children’s health insurance, including dental coverage. There were no issues until I had a brief period of unemployment. When I got a new job, it included health and dental insurance, but there was a waiting period for coverage. To cover that brief period, I bought health insurance for myself and my children but did not purchase dental insurance.

During that time, my ex-husband took our daughter to the dentist for a checkup. The dental practice my daughter visits is her stepmother’s office. When my ex-husband sent me the bill for this visit, which came to $400, I asked if the visit could be postdated by just a day, so I could submit it for insurance. He told me that doing so was illegal and that I needed to pay, and that he didn’t appreciate the fact that I didn’t have any dental coverage.

I asked my daughter why she didn’t let me know about the appointment so I could let her know our dental insurance ended. She said she thought that because it was her stepmother’s office, she was fine.

Since that time I have been receiving bills from this dental practice. I have had conversations with their accounts-payable department to let them know that my daughter is the dentist’s stepdaughter. But no understanding was reached; I have not paid, as I believe it’s wrong to have charged me when it was known that I didn’t have company insurance at the time. I am now getting bills from a collection agency for the $400.

So my question for you is: Do I pay it just to make it go away or try again to reason with my ex-husband and his wife to please drop these fees? Name Withheld

Communication between ex-spouses can be like pulling teeth. So it’s not surprising that you didn’t warn your husband that it would be financially inconvenient for your daughter to have dental treatment at that time. Given that you are in charge of medical insurance, you could reasonably think it odd that your child was taken for a dental visit without your knowledge. But again, not so surprising, especially if your daughter’s teeth are normally looked after at her stepmother’s office.

While your husband is correct that it would be wrong and could be illegal to file a false claim, he and his wife might have been able to help you by agreeing to lower the costs or to spread them out. The fact that the charge was sent to a collection agency also sounds less than cordial. Still, if I understand the situation correctly, you were in breach of your divorce agreement, even if your reasons were entirely understandable. Absent any information from you to the contrary, then, he was entitled to assume that your daughter was covered. You’re asking him and his wife to cover costs that you are liable for.

In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets. If I, with my limited funds and square footage, had devoted a room — albeit a very small one — to my furry friends, what kinds of over-the-top spaces were animal enthusiasts with larger budgets creating for their pets?

With a little research, I discovered such efforts could range from a living room wall transformed into a cat jungle gym to an entire studio apartment dedicated to a family of pets, including three parrots, a feral cat and a 35-year-old tortoise. Many animal lovers in New York and beyond, it seems, think nothing of the cost involved in creating a special space for their pets — even when that sort of customization might cut into the profits when it comes time to sell their homes.

Hunt Slonem, an artist celebrated for his whimsical paintings of animals (particularly bunnies), carved 1,200 square feet out of his 30,000-square-foot studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for his bird family.

Mr. Slonem has kept birds as pets for most of his life, and he currently has about 60 of them, all rescues, including a 75-year-old macaw called Sebastian and a cockatoo named Clyde that follows him everywhere.

The space he has devoted to the birds features dozens of suspended cages, often left open so the birds can fly free, and tile imported from Nicaragua that Mr. Slonem said helps to “define the space and stylishly conceal the droppings.”

Inside this indoor avian community, Mr. Slonem’s birds are free to talk, spat and mate — some for life, as they see fit. The space is so open and accommodating that many of the more social birds, including a close-knit clique of Amazon parrots, make regular house calls to each other’s cages. Feeding the birds, which takes up to five hours a day, requires the full-time services of a professional bird minder who has worked for Mr. Slonem for 35 years and who serves them a fresh salad of leafy greens, melons, bananas, grapes and tofu.

In Mr. Slonem’s latest book, “Birds,” he describes them as his muses and confidantes. He regularly paints among them, and whenever he is within earshot of the aviary, he said, the birds begin to chant his name in unison. “They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said. “And they have huge personalities. They’re my dear friends, a relief from the humdrum of life.”

While Mr. Slonem shares his sprawling studio with the birds, he hasn’t given up any of his own living space. But other New Yorkers have.

In New York by Gehry building in Manhattan, Lucy Swift Weber’s 10-year-old Yorkie, Chauncey, is recovering from cancer. When things got particularly rough last year, Ms. Weber decided to convert the guest bedroom in her two-bedroom apartment into Chauncey’s room, to “give him the space to heal.”

Along with an en-suite bathroom — good for quick water refills and easy cleanup — the dog’s bedroom has a set of customized pet stairs, a plush floor-pillow lounge and a six-foot-tall headboard that Ms. Weber upholstered in a fabric she designed herself. “It’s become this warm, comfortable world where Chauncey can relax and rehabilitate,” Ms. Weber said. “I tried to make the room both calming and cheerful enough that he would want to spend time there, and it worked. He’s in there all of the time by choice.”

But even once he is in better health, Ms. Weber said, Chauncey will continue to have a room of his own; she and her boyfriend just moved into a larger, three-bedroom apartment on another floor of the same building, so that her boyfriend’s college-age sons won’t have to sleep in Chauncey’s room when they visit.

Caroline Stern, who owns three condos on the same floor of her building on Central Park West, went a step further and dedicated an entire 650-square-foot studio to her pets, where they can sleep and roam free when they’re not with her.

Next door to Ms. Stern’s apartment, the pet condo is home to three parrots — Apricot, Sinbad and Roxanne (a Moluccan cockatoo that serves as an emotional support animal) — a feral cat named Butch and an Russian tortoise named Alberta.

To accommodate these animals, Ms. Stern filled the condo with hand-built oversized aviaries, towering bird trees and an ultraviolet-lighted reptile area with a special water bath for Alberta. “Birds are loud,” Ms. Stern said. “It’s comforting to have a soothing place to put them when I can’t deal with the screaming.”

Ms. Stern’s neighbors are more than aware of her pet condo, but for the most part, she said, they are more charmed than perturbed. “It’s an animal-friendly building,” she said. “People stop by to visit; they know they’re lucky pets.”

Such devotion raises an obvious question: When designing extravagant spaces for pets, is property value even worth taking into consideration? As adorable as some of these animal rooms are, they often come at a hefty real estate cost.

“Whether it’s for a person or a parrot, customizing a property always makes it more difficult to sell,” said Ryan Serhant, of Nest Seeker’s Serhant Team. “An animal-dedicated space makes it even more challenging, because they often leave behind lingering smells and damaged surfaces that scare prospective buyers into thinking they’d have to renovate.”

There are, however, less expensive and less intrusive ways to create inviting pet habitats.

In Penfield, N.Y., Jill Sanders sacrificed a single wall in her 15-foot-wide living room to accommodate Nadia, a one-year-old Siberian cat she has been fostering for the last seven months and plans to adopt. Three months ago, when Mrs. Sanders decided to bring home two puppies, she knew she would have to get creative to keep Nadia comfortable. So she called on Mike Wilson and Megan Hanneman, founders of Catastrophic Creations, to devise a dedicated space for Nadia along the living room wall, where the cat could play and escape from the dogs when necessary.

More than 10 feet tall and five feet off the ground, the cat playground is composed of several floating sisal post steps, scratching posts, landing shelves, canvas hammocks and a rope bridge. “Everyone that sees it is blown away by its design-savviness,” Mrs. Sanders said. “I just wanted to give her something that brought her as much joy as she brings our family.”

And in Chicago, Guita Griffiths enlisted the help of Shelley Johnstone, of Shelley Johnstone Design, to create a practical but comforting place for Margaux, her 70-pound yellow Labrador retriever, in her 110-square-foot mudroom.

“Margaux’s a big dog,” Mrs. Griffiths said. “We needed a space to keep her when guests came over, where she wouldn’t feel trapped or anxious.” The result is a 5-by-8-foot space devoted entirely to the 3-year-old dog.

Along with luxuries like heated marble floors, an overstuffed dog bed and canine-printed wallpaper, the room has a spacious sink for Margaux’s baths, storage for her leashes and toys, and a Dutch door, so she can be shut inside without feeling claustrophobic.

And why not?

As Mrs. Griffiths said, “Margaux is just like any other member of our family.”","A Bedroom for Rover, Maybe Even a Condo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/a-bedroom-for-rover-maybe-even-a-condo.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

THE GROWN-UPS’ Table

By Gabrielle Hamilton

For me, it was always a bit of an adult thrill to come downstairs on a Sunday morning, the household still sleeping, and find the table — the long formal one in the dining room — strewn with the last debris of the late-finishing dinner party given by my parents the night before. To walk the table’s perimeter, weaving around the pushed-back chairs, and to collect the foils and corks, the stained wineglasses and the scattered cloth napkins, to get the pancake spatula and pry up the candle wax that had overflowed, felt not unlike sneaking into their bedroom and finding the sheets curiously twisted, the pillows dented and, as long as I was there, furtively helping myself to the loose change left on the bureau. A little like trespassing.

I used to “read” the dinner-table detritus left behind — the felt-tip pen, the ivory silk kerchief, the little pile of strawberry hulls — as if they were fossil impressions not of sea horses or prehistoric invertebrates but of the conversations that were had there just hours earlier, records of a grown-up discussion I was dying to be allowed to join. Examining the remains, I imagined that the Champagne cages someone twisted into the shape of beautiful rudimentary butterflies were formed during a spontaneous recitation of a few lines of poetry. The torn, still-fragrant tangerine peels must have been stacked into neat piles when the conversation turned to the subject of parenting an ungovernable teenager; the cigarette butt crushed into in a walnut husk obviously, in my mind, stubbed out during the heated topic of money. I cleared and cleaned and then polished that table, and I cataloged — loosely, just in my brain — all the tangible things people held and worried in their hands during the lengthy meanderings and the reaching pauses of those adult-dinner-party conversations. The brandy snifters had to have landed, I was certain, around the second punch line of my dad’s best joke, as he dryly delivered the one about the hockey players and hookers.

Setting The Table In the following articles, our five food columnists provide menus and inspiration to help you host your own dinner parties this season. But that's not all. There are also details of the dinner parties that celebrities dream of hosting and tips for sparking great conversations from Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam, hosts of the podcast “The Dinner Party Download.”

Enjoy your meal.

To me it has always been clear that a dinner party is about what is said, not what is eaten. There would always be wine and salad and bread and stew; chocolate and fruit and nuts and sparkling cold duck. But those were just the props — the conduits for funny and real and meaningful conversation; the set pieces of a lively, engaged, lingering old-school dinner party. The one that I have been chasing ever since.

I gave my first in ninth grade, several years after my parents split, at the home of a temporary surrogate guardian. I shopped and prepped and cooked and folded napkins and picked out serving utensils and made candle scapes down the center of the table. But even before the salad course was cleared, my teenage cohort was wasted on red wine, shouting for vodka shots. In the Polaroid I still have, it’s glassy eyes and crimson noses all around — drunken 14-year-olds at a well-set table, in formalwear. I recall I talked to my right-side tablemate, for unending minutes, about his puppy.

Still, over the next five years I persisted in spending my school money on brisket and whole sea bass and bone-in fresh ham, and my weekends sketching table arrangements, clomping through fields collecting grasses and branches to be laid artfully down the centers of tables for dinner parties at which, unfailingly, three people I invited and accounted for said they would come and then didn’t. Or someone I did invite showed up, late, with three people I didn’t invite. They arrived without a bottle or a bouquet. Even in my last year of college, my dinner parties had a juvenile feel — everybody still wasted on the red wine and inevitably looking to do shots — but at least not until dessert, which, alas, they could not quite stay seated through. I remember this as the restless age, with everybody up and down from the table, and outside smoking, leaving an empty seat, an orphaned tablemate, which chokes a conversation as surely as water in a carburetor stalls an engine.

But there were always, also, a couple of guests who knew exactly what to do. Who never arrived too early but allowed you a 10-minute breather just past the hour they were expected. Who never just plopped their paper cone of bodega flowers on the kitchen prep table in the middle of your work but instinctively scanned the cabinets for a vase and arranged the gerbera daisies then and there. They found the trash and put the wrapping in it, leaving your counters clean and your nascent friendship secured for eternity. When less-experienced guests arrived, those perfect friends guided them quickly to the bedroom to stash their coats and bags so they wouldn’t sling them willy-nilly over the backs of the chairs at the dinner table I had spent a week setting.

And over the next 20 years, those couple of perfect friends grew to be many, and because I worked in catering, I was often given excesses to take home — oysters, flowers, steamed lobsters — around which I could organize a dinner. So even if the plumber’s candles came from the hardware store, and the place settings were marked with kitchen work towels, and the table was just a door set on sawhorses, the chairs a bunch of overturned milk crates with Sunday newspapers as cushions, it was still, no matter, a good long decade of people facing one another. The dripping of the candles that formed a frothy white-water wax centerpiece like the one my mother had held us all transfixed. We sat, ate, drank, talked and talked. Smoked, drank, told jokes, argued and talked more. And the wineglasses, the bottles, the foils and the corks, the bread heels were left on the table to be cleared the following day.

Questlove 1/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Dave Chappelle, Tania Bruguera, Shep Gordon, Jimmy Jam Harris, Mathew Knowles, Beth Stelling, Jessica Williams, Phonte Coleman, Gavin Turek. Dave Chappelle is the greatest icebreaker of all time. He once interrupted a 15-person prayer meeting in Prince’s hotel suite at 2 a.m. Super awkward for me, another engaged audience for him. What food would you serve? I don’t cook myself, but I know a lot of chefs. I'd want to hang out with them in the kitchen, and I'd want my guests to see how things are being created. Where would you host it? I want to create a kind of cultural clubhouse in New York. There would be a kitchen for my chef-mafia friends to jam in. What would you be drinking? Cedric Nicaise at Eleven Madison Park is my go-to for wine selections. If the party was dope enough, hopefully he would help me out. What sort of music would you play? Sixties music from Detroit. How would you get people to leave? They can stay, up to a point. But more than once, I’ve called in a noise complaint on my own house. Questlove’s third book, “Creative Quest,” will be published in 2018. Alice Waters 2/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Ruth Reichl, Mark Danner, Calvin Trillin, Bob Carrau, Davia Nelson, Fanny Singer and Michael and Judith Pollan. I invite everybody to come early and help cook, so I guess I’d have to drop Mark Danner and Calvin Trillin in that configuration, because neither of those two people participate. What food would you serve? Soup with pesto, a roast chicken, salad, potato gratin, grapes, Japanese persimmons, pears and chocolate. I always serve mint tea at the end of a meal: It revives you a little bit after you’ve been drinking wine. Where would you host it? At home. What would you be drinking? Rosé while we’re preparing. A red Domaine Tempier with dinner. What sort of music would you play? Miles Davis’s ‘‘Kind of Blue.’’ But ideally, I would have Bob Carrau play piano in the other room. How would you get people to leave? I just turn on Aretha Franklin, and we all wash dishes together. It’s so nice to get up out of your seat and stretch your legs. I love to dance at the end of dinner. Then I just turn off the music, and we say bye. Alice Waters is a chef and the owner of Chez Panisse. Busy Philipps 3/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Marc Silverstein, Irene Neuwirth, Phil Lord, Ed Droste, Simon Renggli, Johnathan Rice, Freckle, Paul F. Tompkins, Janie Haddad Tompkins, Danny McBride, Gia Ruiz. What food would you serve? A fresh tomato-broth pasta dish, a butter-lettuce salad with a buttermilk dressing, flank stank with chimichurri, roasted potatoes, asparagus, ice-cream sundaes. I like having several different kinds of ice cream, including a sorbet, which doesn’t lend itself to a sundae — but some people, especially in Los Angeles, will only have just, like, a bite of sorbet, so that’s what you have to do. Where would you host it? At home. You can see the Hollywood sign, you can see downtown. What would you be drinking? Margaritas or some sort of tequila drink. What sort of music would you play? Rostam, Frank Ocean, Chance the Rapper, Alex G, Lana Del Rey, Belle and Sebastian. We could play Grizzly Bear’s new album, although Ed might get a little embarrassed that we’re playing his music. How would you get people to leave? I just go to bed. People get the hint. Busy Philipps appears on “Vice Principals” on HBO. DJ Khaled 4/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Obama, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Nas, Rihanna, Drake, Michael Jordan, Oprah. And whomever my 1-year-old son, Asahd, wants to invite. What food would you serve? Maqluba, an Arabic dish with rice, chicken and eggplant. Where would you host it? My home. What would you be drinking? Cîroc, Luc Belaire, D’ussé, wine. What sort of music would you play? Sizzla, Buju Banton, Bob Marley, Sadé. How would you get people to leave? I would just keep bringing dessert out. DJ Khaled’s most recent album, “Grateful,” was released in June. John Waters 5/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Eminem, though I know he’d never come; the Fassbinder star Irm Hermann; Judy Clarke, the defense lawyer who has never talked to the press (hopefully she’d loosen up after a few drinks); Lana Del Rey; the Argentine sexpot Isabel Sarli; Ingrid Superstar, Warhol’s almost-forgotten actress, who wandered away from her mother’s home and was never seen again. I refuse to believe she’s dead. Ingrid! Dinner’s served! What food would you serve? Liver. Shut up and eat it. Where would you host it? In my Baltimore dining room, so the guests would look up at that great Mike Kelley drawing I have that kind of looks like a big turd. What would you be drinking? Open bar, including “mocktails” for guests who might be in A.A. What sort of music would you play? King Krule, Elvis Perkins, Future Islands, Iris DeMent, Glenn Gould. How would you get people to leave? Easy. Just put on that soundtrack of Gaspar Noé’s “Irreversible.” The “A John Waters Christmas” spoken-word tour begins Nov. 27 in Chicago.

I’ve always been against the insistent, well-meaning cleanup brigade that convenes in the kitchen before anybody has even digested. Those people who are pushing back their chairs and clearing the dessert plates from the table just as you are squeezing the oily tangerine peels into the flames to watch the blue shower of sparks, who are emptying all the ashtrays just as you are dipping your finger in the wine and then running it around the rim of your wineglasses to make tones like those from a monastery in Tibet. When I invite you over, I mean it. I mean: Sit down. I will take care of you. I will buy the food and get the drinks and set the table and do the cooking, and I will clean up after. And when I come to your house, you will do the same. I will get to have the honor of being a guest. To perfectly show up, 10 minutes after the appointed time, with a bottle in hand for you, to bring my outgoing, conversational self, my good mood, my appetite, and to then enjoy all that is offered to me, and to then get my coat at the very end and leave without having lifted a finger. It is just the greatest thing of all time.

But just when I could finally afford to buy my first 13-quart heavy enamel Le Creuset lidded pot, and invite people to dinner around a real table — not a Salvation Army jobbie — guests started coming to dinner with their phones, the glow of those screens as lethal to the conversation as empty seats had been. People passed them back and forth to show photos meant to illustrate things that they used to describe verbally. We stopped looking at one another across the table and started crowding in on one another staring together at a tiny hand-held screen someone was holding up in explanation of a trip to India, the fog from a morning run. Quickly our vocabularies shrank. Instead of summoning words, people tapped on images. People stopped finishing their sentences. And in startlingly short order, they could no longer describe with language the places they had been; the way they had felt in the dark night; the powerful weight of the tropical winds and the humidity of their recent vacations, the dirt road they got lost on, the woman who brought milk and bread and butter and yogurt to their pensione. There were fewer well-told stories at the dinner table, fewer compelling twists and pauses, fewer meandering conversations among the group, until there were almost no more wire Champagne cages gently twisted into the shapes of animals. We had our hands full with our phones.

And then suddenly, any talking was about the food itself. Not just the food on the table in front of us but the food at last night’s table, and the lunch the day before that, the food at the restaurant on vacation, the food in the magazine, the food on Instagram. I set the table and cooked the food and poured the wine as I had for decades, but now, as soon as the first course landed, someone snapped a photo of it. Had my children come downstairs to say good night, they would not have felt any ripple of excitement at the din of adult conversation they were allowed to glimpse. Nothing adult to trespass upon. The dinner party nearly died for me then.

But if I had given up on people not quite knowing what to do at a dinner party, I would have given up back in ninth grade. The dinner party now depends more than ever on having one frequently, offhandedly, with abandon. If there are only eight seats and you know a few are going to end up with someone who’s got his head down to check his phone every 20 minutes, or who will be drunk on red wine by the salad course, just think of next month. To know that there will always be, for you, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, a well-set table and a roast and a salad and still, always, the wine, is to know that you are always going to find along the way another perfect friend, and then yet another.

Invite some outliers in there, some unexpecteds. Your several perfect friends, of course, who really know how it’s done but also that person you’ve always had such affection for at your coffee shop but with whom you never had any exchange that lasted longer than 20 minutes. The new couple who moved in across the street. The cousin of your old friend who is having empty-nest syndrome. The line cook at your restaurant who never asks for a day off. Your editor at the magazine whom you torture monthly with deadline trauma.

Set the table. Arrange the chairs. Even if you can now afford real flowers, trudge across a field for a morning anyway collecting attractive branches and grasses to arrange down the center of the table — it will put you right. Roast the rabbits and braise the lentils, and clean the leeks and light all the candles. Even now, someone may get a little lit on the red wine and want to do a shot. But that may be just what your dinner party needs. Get out the Fernet Branca, and pour everyone a shot, and tell your dad’s best one-liner, the one about Mrs. Katz. When your kids come downstairs to say good night, give them a glimpse of something unforgettable.

The Kurdish government has also lost its main economic assets and several major oil fields, and has been met with almost complete international isolation.

The setbacks have given the Kurds a significantly weakened hand in negotiations between Iraqi commanders and their Kurdish counterparts to codify the sharply changed balance of power between the two sides.

The talks, mediated by United States military officers, convened after Mr. Abadi declared a temporary end to military operations to forcefully seize the border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria.

People close to the negotiators say Baghdad is nearing an agreement with Kurdish commanders that would have federal forces take over the border crossings, and fundamentally recalibrate how the region’s oil is exported, a revenue source that is essential to Kurdish dreams of self-reliance.

Such an agreement would be the steepest decline in Kurdish political fortunes since the group gained autonomy from Baghdad after the 1991 Gulf War.

The resignation of Mr. Barzani, who has not named a successor, leaves open the question of who else — either in his ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party or family — has the authority to approve such a deal.

Mr. Barzani served for two four-year terms as president, the maximum allowed under Kurdish law. He received a two-year extension in 2013 because of security fears amid the rise of the Islamic State in the region, but he has remained in power well beyond that time without legal justification.

Mr. Barzani’s government recently delayed elections that were scheduled for Nov. 1 — the first elections since 2013 — fueling rumors that the president planned to remain in office indefinitely.

In his speech on Sunday, Mr. Barzani did not clarify what his future political role would be.

Since taking up the presidency in 2005, Mr. Barzani has concentrated significant power in that office, while also placing close members of his family in critical leadership positions. A nephew is regional prime minister, and a son is in charge of the region’s security apparatus.

At Sunday morning’s regional parliamentary session in Erbil, lawmakers discussed Mr. Barzani’s instructions in his resignation letter to distribute his presidential powers between the prime minister’s office, which is held by his nephew; Parliament itself, which is dominated by his political party; and the judiciary.

Tempers flared in the course of the debate. A pro-Barzani lawmaker punched a Kurdish opposition lawmaker who had criticized Mr. Barzani’s record as leader, leading to a fracas and a delay in proceedings.

After sunset, as lawmakers continued their work, hundreds of club-wielding men descended on the regional Parliament, trapping dozens of politicians inside. Some members of the mob attacked local journalists covering Parliament. Local news media outlets reported hearing gunshots inside, but there were no immediate reports of injuries.

The violence drew condemnation from Sarwa Abdul Wahid, the parliamentary leader for the opposition Goran party and a vocal critic of Mr. Barzani and his party.

“What happened this evening at Parliament was a terror act and the K.D.P. is morally responsible for it,” Ms. Abdul Wahid said, referring to the ruling party. “We are witnessing the destruction of our whole legislative establishment in the region.”

The speaker of the parliament, Yusef Mohammed, blamed “thugs and anarchists” for the violence.

The standoff continued after midnight, with some pesh merga security commanders trying to help lawmakers evacuate the building. But the mob insisted that Goran lawmakers apologize for what they called disrespect shown to Mr. Barzani.","Kurdish Leader Quits, Latest Fallout From Much-Criticized Independence Vote",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/world/middleeast/iraq-kurds-masoud-barzani.html

While the indictment of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates did not touch directly on collusion, it made clear that the two were paid tens of millions of dollars over years leading up to the campaign by Ukrainian political leaders allied with Russia and that their efforts to defraud continued through their time with the campaign until early this year.

In the past, the president has signaled that he might dismiss Mr. Mueller if the special counsel exceeded what Mr. Trump considers the mandate of his investigation. Mr. Trump has also publicly noted that he has the “complete power to pardon” relatives, aides and possibly even himself in response to the special counsel investigation.

Democrats quickly warned Mr. Trump on Monday not to impede Mr. Mueller’s investigation. “The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader. “If he does so, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally, and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the indictment showed that Mr. Mueller “is doing his job” and that the process was working. “I’ll continue to support Bob Mueller as he follows the facts — his independence must remain sacrosanct,” she said.

Even before the indictment was unsealed, Mr. Trump’s supporters argued that it would not mean much if it were focused on Mr. Manafort’s private business activities rather than the campaign.

“This could be a big old nothing burger if it was pre-campaign, but post-campaign it’s going to be serious stuff,” Representative Sean Duffy, Republican of Wisconsin, said on CNN. He added: “To taint Donald Trump with things Manafort did before the campaign, I think, is a leap too far.”

Mr. Manafort, a longtime Washington lobbyist and Republican operative, ran Mr. Trump’s campaign for several months last year before being dismissed in August 2016 amid questions about his work for Ukraine’s since-ousted pro-Russian government. Mr. Trump and his aides have since sought to minimize Mr. Manafort’s importance to the president, despite reports that Mr. Manafort remained in contact with the White House even after the inauguration in January.

In March, Sean Spicer, then the White House press secretary, said Mr. Manafort had only a “limited role for a very limited amount of time.” In August, after Mr. Manafort’s house was searched by the F.B.I., Mr. Trump said, “He was with the campaign, as you know, for a very short period of time, relatively short period of time.”

But the president’s political opponents on Monday eagerly distributed a tweet from last year from Sean Hannity, the Fox News host and friend of Mr. Trump’s, quoting Newt Gingrich, another Trump ally, boasting of Mr. Manafort’s role. “Nobody should underestimate how much Paul Manafort did to really help get this campaign to where it is right now,” Mr. Gingrich was quoted saying.

Mr. Trump started the morning seeking again to turn attention to the Democrats, as he did over the weekend. In his first tweet of the day, he focused on the firm that helped produce a dossier of salacious allegations against Mr. Trump during last year’s campaign and its links to Democrats who helped finance it.

“Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS,” Mr. Trump wrote. “The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?) from DNC. Nobody knows who OK’d!”

He did not mention the fact that the firm that conducted the research for the dossier was originally hired during the Republican primaries by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website financed in large part by a prominent Republican donor, the hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer.

After Mr. Manafort was brought to an F.B.I. office on Monday morning, Mr. Trump sought again to turn the tables on Democrats. “But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????” he wrote as part of his tweet dismissing the indictment of Mr. Manafort.

Democrats said the Manafort indictment made clear how serious Mr. Mueller’s investigation has become.

“After Mr. Trump whipped up a tweet storm of suspicion about Mueller this weekend, he really now has no place to go with this attack,” said Robert Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama. “Mueller’s first charge is beyond any potential claim of ‘politics’ or ‘stretching’ that the president might wish to bring against him and his office. To the extent that Mueller needed any early credibility for his office under hostile fire, this does the job, and then some.”

Mr. Trump has no public events on his schedule on Monday until 5:45 p.m. when he and the first lady were due to participate in a Halloween event on the South Lawn. His press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is scheduled to conduct her daily briefing at 1:15 p.m.

Ty Cobb, the White House special counsel focused on the investigation, said last week that the president is not worried about anything that Mr. Manafort or Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser, might tell prosecutors about Mr. Trump.

“The president has no concerns in terms of any impact, as to what happens to them, on his campaign or on the White House,” Mr. Cobb told The New York Times.

“He likes and respects Mr. Manafort and appreciates the work he did for him during the three months he was with the campaign. He likes General Flynn personally, but understands that they have their own path with the special counsel,” Mr. Cobb added. “I think he would be sad for them, as a friend and a former colleague, if the process results in punishment or indictments. But to the extent that that happens, that’s beyond his control.”","For Trump, Indictment of Former Top Lieutenant Raises the Stakes",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/trump-manafort-indictment-analysis.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

(The teams set a World Series record with eight home runs in total, including five in extra innings.)
Once I was done, I looked over at the secondary document I had open on my computer.
There is probably a funny compilation to be made of all the drafts of historic game stories that never saw the light of day.","As if it had fallen from the sky, a fruitful theme emerged in the sixth inning: Corey Seager, the Dodgers’ All-Star shortstop — who missed the previous round of the playoffs with a bad back — smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run. (Hitting a baseball is hard enough; imagine bashing it into the stands when it is thrown at 97 miles per hour and you have barely played the past two weeks.)

Even when standout Dodgers relievers Brandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen gave up a run in the eighth inning, the Dodgers still held a 3-2 lead, and I thought the 950 words of a story framed around Seager would still work. I even liked how I had written it.

But in the top of the ninth inning, something unlikely happened: Astros’ left fielder Marwin Gonzalez, who had been struggling in the playoffs, clobbered a game-tying home run off Jansen, who had never blown a save in his playoff career. It was 11:18 p.m. Eastern.

While the most dramatic, mind-bending games are fun to watch on the couch or at the bar or in the stands, trying to capture the many late-game twists and turns as the final print edition deadline nears can be nerve-racking.

So, goodbye Corey Seager story. I copied it all into a separate document and started rewriting.

Then, in the top of the 10th inning, Astros stars Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa gave Houston a 5-3 lead with two solo home runs. As a reporter, I have no rooting interest. But this gave me a little bit of a cushion from deadline pressure: The Dodgers still had to bat in the bottom of the inning.

I reframed the story around Houston’s improbable comeback against a Dodgers bullpen that had not allowed a run in 25 consecutive innings entering the game, focusing on the blasts by Gonzalez, Correa and Altuve.

At 11:50 p.m., the night sports editor, Joel Petterson, emailed to remind me that they would need the story immediately when the game ended to get it into the final edition.

“Don’t worry if it’s sloppy, we’ll clean up whatever,” said Petterson, who has saved me on deadline before.

Within 10 minutes of his email, the Dodgers tied the score, at 5-5, with a home run by Yasiel Puig and a single by Enrique Hernandez. I wrote back to Petterson: “I’ve added like 50 white hairs the past three innings alone.” I had not gotten up from my seat since the fifth inning.

By now, I knew that I needed to come up with a way to capture the mayhem of the game, no matter the outcome. I wrote a broad introduction — or lede, as we call it in journalism — and worked backward through the wildest moments of the game. (The teams set a World Series record with eight home runs in total, including five in extra innings.) I left a few sentences with blanks, knowing I would fill in the final details — the time of the game, the last out, the winning hit.

As soon as the game ended, I sent in my story. After talking to the managers and players, I filed an updated version for the web, since the print deadline had long passed.

Once I was done, I looked over at the secondary document I had open on my computer.

There is probably a funny compilation to be made of all the drafts of historic game stories that never saw the light of day.

WASHINGTON — In the first charges in the special counsel investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about his conversations with people linked to the Russian government about potential “dirt” on Hillary Clinton and Russia’s openness to “cooperation” with the campaign.

Separately, President Trump’s former campaign manager Paul J. Manafort Jr., and his business partner, Rick Gates, were indicted. The charges they face do not relate to Mr. Trump or the campaign, but it is widely believed that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is hoping to pressure Mr. Manafort into providing information about the central subject of his investigation.

Mr. Papadopoulos is charged with lying to the F.B.I. during an interview in early 2017. A 14-page statement of the offense that accompanies the brief criminal information filing shows that Mr. Papadopoulos was questioned by the F.B.I. about his interactions during the campaign with two apparent Russian agents — an unnamed professor and an unnamed “female Russian national,” who each had substantial connections to Russian government officials. The filing says Mr. Papadopoulos falsely played down the significance of those conversations and falsely said he had not yet joined the campaign when they reached out to him.

Lying to federal investigators is a felony that can carry a sentence of up to five years in prison, giving Mr. Papadopoulos an incentive to cooperate in exchange for leniency.

Health experts widely agree that most of us should sit less, especially at work. Prolonged sitting has been linked with higher risks for diabetes and heart disease, among other conditions. While treadmill and standing desks have grown in popularity, they provide a clear impact on our health but perhaps not on our work itself. We know that most people type better when they sit still than when they stand up or move about. But do they also think better?

Most studies of prolonged sitting have looked at the benefits from breaking up sitting time on blood sugar and blood pressure. For an innovative new study published recently in The Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, researchers at Arizona State University in Phoenix recruited nine sedentary, overweight men and women and asked them to show up at a simulated office space at the university.

During one visit, the volunteers sat continuously for eight hours (apart from bathroom breaks), while using a computer and talking on the phone, as if it were any workday. Twice during the day, they also completed computerized measures of many thinking skills, including working memory and decision making.

Then, during three other faux workdays, the volunteers broke up their sitting time by variously standing, walking at a treadmill desk or pedaling a modified stationary bicycle placed beneath their desks for at least 10 minutes once an hour. The exercise was gentle — a walking pace of one mile per hour or comparable effort while pedaling — and the volunteers typed and chatted during these breaks. They also repeated the tests of thinking twice each day, immediately after standing or exercising.

The researchers had wondered whether standing or exercising might impair the ability to concentrate and think, much as it did with typing proficiency, says Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise and health promotion at Arizona State who oversaw the study.

SHANGHAI — Just days after being likened to a king by President Trump, President Xi Jinping of China on Monday reiterated his commitment to reform while holding court before a group of wealthy and influential business leaders from his country and the United States.

Mr. Xi, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during an event shown on national television, addressed topics such as globalization, innovation and China’s relationship with the United States at a gathering of executives who included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple; Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group; and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive.

One clear way to spur economic growth is to entice more people to participate in it.
We don’t know yet how many employers will opt out of providing their employees with no-cost birth control under Mr. Trump’s rule change.","The ability to opt out of offering no-cost contraception, then, is not just about religious objections. Obamacare lifted an enormous financial burden that women alone had to bear. Before the A.C.A., 85 percent of health insurance plans at large companies offered contraceptive coverage, but most required at least a co-payment. Individual women paid about $250 a year. Now the president has given insurance companies a way out of taking on that burden.

The Trump administration has tried to reassure women that they can still get inexpensive birth control, asserting that “many forms of contraception are available for around $50 a month.” Even if that’s the case, $50 a month — $600 a year — is no small item in many people’s budgets, particularly for the women who make up a majority of low-wage workers. As the Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has pointed out, the cost of an intrauterine device, one of the most effective forms of contraception, is about the same as a month’s minimum-wage pay.

This doesn’t just matter to individual women. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of all economic growth, and women are responsible for an outsize portion of that spending. Billions of dollars less a year in their pockets means billions of dollars less that they could spend on goods other than birth control, dampening their ability to support businesses and the economy.

But a larger economic impact of reconstructing a cost barrier to contraception is likely to be felt throughout the entire work force. High birth rates have historically lowered women’s ability to get and keep paid work, which isn’t so hard to understand — holding down a job becomes a lot more difficult when it has to be balanced with pregnancies and raising children. That’s particularly true if women aren’t even in control of when they become pregnant.

On the other hand, a raft of evidence has definitively found that when women gained greater access to the pill in the late 1960s and early ’70s, they were able to delay marriage and childbirth and invest in careers through education, job training and staying in paid work.

Legal access to the pill transformed the economy in that era. It increased young women’s labor force participation by 7 percent. Those who were able to get it the earliest because of relaxed state laws worked significantly more hours than those who couldn’t get it until later. In fact, about a third of the increase in how many women attained careers in fields like law and business was due to birth control.

Women with earlier access to the pill also made 8 percent more than their peers, and the pill was responsible for about a third of the decrease in the gender wage gap by 1990.

Birth control is still playing the economic role that it did in the 1970s. About half of women who use it say they do so to complete education or to get and keep a job. Contraception is still increasing the share of women who get educated and get paid work, particularly prestigious jobs.

President Trump has promised to gin up the economy so that it’s growing at 4 percent a year or more, something it hasn’t done for a sustained amount of time for over a decade. That kind of growth will be extremely difficult to reach without policy interventions, and tax changes or tough talk on trade won’t cut it.

One clear way to spur economic growth is to entice more people to participate in it. The high growth rates during the Reagan years were linked in part to women continuing to enter the workplace. But women are already trickling out of the work force, and it could get worse with more unexpected pregnancies.

We don’t know yet how many employers will opt out of providing their employees with no-cost birth control under Mr. Trump’s rule change. Women who work at the employers that do opt out could face yet another barrier to staying in the labor force.

The Kurdish government has also lost its main economic assets and several major oil fields, and has been met with almost complete international isolation.

The setbacks have given the Kurds a significantly weakened hand in negotiations between Iraqi commanders and their Kurdish counterparts to codify the sharply changed balance of power between the two sides.

The talks, mediated by United States military officers, convened after Mr. Abadi declared a temporary end to military operations to forcefully seize the border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria.

People close to the negotiators say Baghdad is nearing an agreement with Kurdish commanders that would have federal forces take over the border crossings, and fundamentally recalibrate how the region’s oil is exported, a revenue source that is essential to Kurdish dreams of self-reliance.

Such an agreement would be the steepest decline in Kurdish political fortunes since the group gained autonomy from Baghdad after the 1991 Gulf War.

The resignation of Mr. Barzani, who has not named a successor, leaves open the question of who else — either in his ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party or family — has the authority to approve such a deal.

Mr. Barzani served for two four-year terms as president, the maximum allowed under Kurdish law. He received a two-year extension in 2013 because of security fears amid the rise of the Islamic State in the region, but he has remained in power well beyond that time without legal justification.

Mr. Barzani’s government recently delayed elections that were scheduled for Nov. 1 — the first elections since 2013 — fueling rumors that the president planned to remain in office indefinitely.

In his speech on Sunday, Mr. Barzani did not clarify what his future political role would be.

Since taking up the presidency in 2005, Mr. Barzani has concentrated significant power in that office, while also placing close members of his family in critical leadership positions. A nephew is regional prime minister, and a son is in charge of the region’s security apparatus.

At Sunday morning’s regional parliamentary session in Erbil, lawmakers discussed Mr. Barzani’s instructions in his resignation letter to distribute his presidential powers between the prime minister’s office, which is held by his nephew; Parliament itself, which is dominated by his political party; and the judiciary.

Tempers flared in the course of the debate. A pro-Barzani lawmaker punched a Kurdish opposition lawmaker who had criticized Mr. Barzani’s record as leader, leading to a fracas and a delay in proceedings.

After sunset, as lawmakers continued their work, hundreds of club-wielding men descended on the regional Parliament, trapping dozens of politicians inside. Some members of the mob attacked local journalists covering Parliament. Local news media outlets reported hearing gunshots inside, but there were no immediate reports of injuries.

The violence drew condemnation from Sarwa Abdul Wahid, the parliamentary leader for the opposition Goran party and a vocal critic of Mr. Barzani and his party.

“What happened this evening at Parliament was a terror act and the K.D.P. is morally responsible for it,” Ms. Abdul Wahid said, referring to the ruling party. “We are witnessing the destruction of our whole legislative establishment in the region.”

The speaker of the parliament, Yusef Mohammed, blamed “thugs and anarchists” for the violence.

The standoff continued after midnight, with some pesh merga security commanders trying to help lawmakers evacuate the building. But the mob insisted that Goran lawmakers apologize for what they called disrespect shown to Mr. Barzani.","Kurdish Leader Quits, Latest Fallout From Much-Criticized Independence Vote",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/world/middleeast/iraq-kurds-masoud-barzani.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The detectives asked her to prove it, and the young woman lifted up her shirt, showing them her breasts.
The woman also had some marijuana and a few pills of Klonopin, an anti-anxiety drug, in her handbag, Mr. DeGaetano said.
The document also showed that her two friends were also unable to identify Detective Martins and that one of them misidentified Detective Hall.","According to a detailed account delivered by a prosecutor, Frank DeGaetano, the incident occurred on Sept. 15, when Detectives Hall and Martins were conducting operations in the Coney Island neighborhood as part of an antidrug unit, Brooklyn South Narcotics. Around 8 p.m., Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives broke off from the rest of their team and stopped an Infinity coupe in Calvert Vaux Park. The 18-year-old woman was driving, he said; two of her friends, both men, were also in the car.

As the detectives — both in plainclothes — approached the car, one of them shined his flashlight through the window and saw the young woman adjusting her bra. When Detective Hall asked if she was hiding something, she told him she was simply adjusting her nipple piercing, Mr. DeGaetano said. The detectives asked her to prove it, and the young woman lifted up her shirt, showing them her breasts.

A search of the car revealed a small amount of marijuana in a cup holder. The woman also had some marijuana and a few pills of Klonopin, an anti-anxiety drug, in her handbag, Mr. DeGaetano said. At that point, he added, the detectives took the woman from the car, placed her in handcuffs and put her into the second row of their Dodge police van. Driving off, they told her that she would be released within a few hours at the 60th Precinct station house. According to Mr. DeGaetano, Detective Martins used his cellphone to call the woman’s friends and explicitly instructed them not to follow the van, using a blocking function to disguise the number he was calling from.

It was then that Detective Martins sat down next to the woman and said that he and his partner were “freaks,” asking her what she wanted to do to avoid being arrested, Mr. DeGaetano said. After tightening the handcuffs, Detective Martins pulled out his penis and forced the woman to perform oral sex on him, Mr. DeGaetano said. Then he turned her around, pulled her pants down and raped her, Mr. DeGaetano added, as Detective Hall watched through the rearview mirror and the young woman cried and pleaded with Detective Martins to stop.

By that point, Mr. DeGaetano said, the van was in Bay Ridge, at least four miles from where the antidrug team had been working. Mr. DeGaetano said that Detective Hall switched places with his partner and also forced the woman to perform oral sex on him then raped her.

After the attack, Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives returned to Coney Island and dropped the woman off about five blocks from their station house. Before she left, they made her take one of her Klonopin pills and told her to “keep her mouth shut,” Mr. DeGaetano said.

Within days, the city medical examiner’s office had analyzed a rape test performed on the woman and determined that it contained samples of both detectives’ sperm, Mr. DeGaetano said. “These are extremely serious charges,” he added, saying that each could face up to 25 years in prison.

Detective Martins, who joined the Police Department in July 2006, had his bail set at $250,000, and Detective Hall, who joined in July 2010, had his bail set at $150,000. Both were suspended and demoted on Friday, after the grand jury handed up the indictment.

Even with physical evidence like DNA, rape prosecutions are often difficult, and a court document filed on Monday hinted at some of the vulnerabilities defense lawyers may seek to exploit.

One day after the encounter, which took place after dark and which the detectives had allegedly threatened the woman not to talk about, investigators from the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau interviewed her and found she that while she could identify Detective Hall from a photo array, she was unable to identify Detective Martins, according to the court document. The document also showed that her two friends were also unable to identify Detective Martins and that one of them misidentified Detective Hall.

Calling the indictment “schizophrenic,” John Arlia, a lawyer for Detective Hall, noted at the arraignment that the charges included accusations of both “forcible” rape and of using sex to bribe a police officer — a “self-contradictory” position, suggesting that the prosecutors had two theories of the case and were not entirely confident about the young woman’s account.

Mark A. Bederow, Detective Martin’s lawyer, said his client had been subjected for weeks to a “circus” of allegations made in the media by the young woman’s lawyer, Michael David. Mr. Bederow called the woman’s account “uncorroborated.” He told Justice Danny K. Chun, who is handling the case, that while prosecutors had furnished DNA evidence, they had not provided surveillance footage connected to the attack, which allegedly took place on a Friday night in the parking lot of a Chipotle restaurant, nor of the detectives releasing the woman near the station house.

Mr. Bederow added that he had “substantial information” that would undermine her story, suggesting that she had a “financial” motive to lie about the attack.

At a news conference after the arraignment, Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, asked anyone who may have had similar encounters with the detectives to come forward. He also condemned the detectives’ lawyers for attacking the victim.

“It is shocking and unfortunate that they would blame a teenager for the acts of their clients,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “To think that these are grown men in a position of power over an 18-year-old, and for them to blame her, is ridiculous and demeaning. To my mind it speaks to desperation.”",Two New York Detectives Are Charged With Raping Teenager in Custody,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/nypd-detectives-rape-kidnapping-charges.html

Last week, perhaps in anticipation of what was coming from Robert Mueller’s office, Mr. Trump tweeted the false claim that, “It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!” For the past week, Mr. Trump, Republicans, and conservative media have been pressing that bizarre claim.

This is a shameful and transparent effort to turn an investigation rooted in national security into a rank political spat, and to tar Mr. Mueller, a nonpartisan public servant with a long record of integrity. It speaks volumes about the integrity — and the growing nervousness — of Mr. Trump and his allies that they would stoop to this level. But after all, Mr. Trump hired Mr. Manafort, international pariahs’ lobbyist of choice.

With the release of the indictments and plea deal, Republicans in Congress need to abandon this absurd denial of reality and start asking serious questions about the validity of the 2016 election and of the Trump administration:

Why was the Trump campaign talking with people tied to Moscow, especially ones who offered to provide it with Clinton campaign emails? If what Mr. Papadopoulos was doing was legitimate, why did he lie to the F.B.I. about it?

Why are members of the administration so accommodating to Moscow?

What other connections did the campaign have to Russia?

The efforts by Mr. Trump and his Republican enablers to short-circuit congressional investigations into this, as well as to cast doubt on the special counsel’s findings, make Mr. Mueller’s work all the more important. So far, Mr. Trump hasn’t deterred Mr. Mueller and his team from conducting a careful, detailed probe of what Russia did to subvert our democratic process in 2016 and of what Mr. Trump’s associates might have done to help.

Because here’s the strange thing: I never did get bored, or lonely, or restless during my stint in Zittel’s world.","I have driven west to see her from the “Experimental Living Cabins,” set on 15 acres a 40-minute drive away in Wonder Valley, a desolate, unincorporated corner of the Mojave Desert, near the joyless sprawl of Twentynine Palms, home to one of the largest military training areas in the country. Zittel started buying up acreage to add to her holdings several years ago, attracted by the site’s remoteness and the several ramshackle “jackrabbit homesteads” on the property (really, little more than a dusty patch of desert), relics of the Small Tract Act of 1938, which lured pioneers to “prove up” five acres. (The terrain is so inhospitable that few actually stayed.) She now owns three of the cabins, though only two are renovated: simple board-and-batten structures, painted gray with white trim, that stand alone amid the scrub brush, 600 feet apart in the wide, flat basin rimmed in the distance by purpled mountains. She originally intended to use them for herself — ironically, between occasional afternoon visitors and the residents who come for longer stays in exchange for help with site maintenance, A-Z West is such a hive these days that Zittel rarely has the alone time she craves — but like most elements in her life, the cabins have become part of her work, perhaps even the ultimate expression of it.

When she bought the land in Wonder Valley, she was in the midst of making a series of sculptures called “Planar Configurations,” based on her longstanding fascination with the “planar panel” — basically, anything that is rectangular, whether a 4-by-8 piece of plywood, a 8½-by-11 sheet of printer paper or a table top. Each sculpture, made of wood, red fiberglass and black-matte aluminum or steel, is a set of interconnected rectangles, like a 3D Mondrian, that function as a table, bed, counter and room divider. Last year, Zittel, always frustrated by how few people actually get to interact with her work, and ever on the lookout for ways to finance her many projects, had a revelation: She could put a “Planar Configuration” inside each of the cabins, and allow people to stay in them, for rates comparable to a nearby Airbnb. It would be the first time that a stranger could reside in Zittel’s universe full time, in utter privacy, in contrast to the “Wagon Station Encampment” with its communal ethos and group activities.

The “Experimental Living Cabins,” at which I am one of the first guests, are intended for solo visitors who stay anywhere from two days to three weeks, and though a smattering of boxy one-story houses dot the area, they are so low, and so distant, that it’s easy to forget they exist at all. One can go for days without human interaction, or one can hop in the car and drive down the dirt road to the Palms Restaurant for a beer. The point of the cabins isn’t to enact the now-clichéd off-the-grid adventure, but to exist just a few steps outside real life, in a stripped-down but completely functional environment — to re-examine, even relearn, everyday activities. A welcome disorientation, even an epiphany or two, might arise from doing without conventional touchstones like, say, a mirror, or a refrigerator. (Visitors are given a supply of bottled water, but bring in their own food and ice to stock the cooler.)

And there is plenty of furniture in the literal sense, just not anything that reads easily as such. “I do believe in a certain amount of comfort,” Zittel says. “I believe in having a good spot to position your body so you can relax and do things. But I want people to find their own comfort without being catered to. It’s not just waiting there for you.”

She is intimately familiar with the comfortable-uncomfortable sensation that the cabins can evoke; it characterized her early years in the desert. When Zittel left Brooklyn in 2000, many in the art world viewed it as a surprising retrenchment or even the end of her career. She had spent almost a decade represented by the acclaimed Andrea Rosen Gallery, showing such apparently urban-inflected works as the 1994 “A-Z Living Units,” a precursor to the “Planar Configurations” — portable pods that seemed inspired by cramped studios: Barbie’s-Dreamhouse-by-way-of-Bauhaus.

Although she had grown up north of San Diego and spent time at her grandparents’ ranch in California’s Imperial Valley, she didn’t yearn for the wilderness in her 10 years in New York. There were no signs in her work of the organic monumentalism synonymous with the sculptors and conceptualists who first decamped for the desert, and she didn’t seem the type to erect a permanent museum of her art, as did the assemblage artist Noah Purifoy, a pioneer when he left L.A. for Joshua Tree in the 1980s. Nor did she give indications of wanting to create a conventional home and burrow into a solitary relationship with two-dimensional work, as had the female artists who famously forsook New York City for the Southwest, Georgia O’Keeffe and Agnes Martin. She was social, hosting weekly cocktail parties in her Williamsburg townhouse.

But as others began discovering Brooklyn, she began feeling a pull toward the sun-blasted, desolate terrain of her childhood. Zittel sees herself as part of the 20th-century tradition of American artists leaving cities for the open spaces of the Southwest, but she is aware of her deviations. O’Keeffe and Martin chose the desert as a form of retreat, but Zittel saw it as liberation. As for the parallels often drawn between her and the largely male artists who came to make their massive, macho marks on the desert, she gently notes that she is not interested in “grand interventions,” only in finding meaning in intimate, everyday gestures. “The act of inhabiting and having an evolving relationship with a space or place is inherently different from the act of installing works like ‘Spiral Jetty’ or ‘Double Negative,’ ” she says.

During my stay in the cabin, I established a routine determined by the movements of the sun: After daylight nudged me awake around five, I rose from the bed portion of the “Planar Configuration” and unlocked both doors to let in the early cross-breeze. Then I scooped ant corpses from the ice cooler and retrieved my sack of ground coffee. I checked my shoes for scorpions/tarantulas, and stepped outside to the composting toilet. I’d save the outdoor shower — a water tank modified with a hand pump — for later in the day, when the heat was unbearable. Then it was off to assess the dwindling freshwater reserve and to conduct frugal ablutions over a steel sink that drained through a black hose into a bucket below. I filled the kettle. Ignited the propane stove. Set out French press, bowl and spoon. (In keeping with Zittel’s catechism, there are only bowls, never glasses or plates, which she deems unnecessarily use-specific.) Carried two black wooden vintage stools out to the patio, one for sitting, the other for my breakfast and books. Every time a bead of perspiration rolled down my leg, I’d assume it was an ant and tried to flick it off, never learning.

In the afternoon, the hot wind in my face like a blow dryer on high, I drove to the air-conditioned local library, with Zittel’s blessing; the cabin stay is meant to be challenging but not life-threatening. Back home around 6:00 p.m., I cooked a meal of spiced beans, avocado and tortillas and washed up in the final sliver of sun. After lighting the oil lanterns, I watched their flickering patterns, then sat outside to read. By 9:30 p.m. I was asleep, atop white sheets, enveloped in unbroken darkness.

Before my trip, I’d been thinking about Zittel in relation to the social-utopia-makers of the 19th century, the “material feminists” who sought liberation by transforming the domestic sphere. In 1868, Melusina Fay Peirce, an organizer and author, spearheaded the “cooperative housekeeping movement,” proposing that wives charge their husbands for their domestic labor. The writer and reformer Charlotte Perkins Gilman argued for taking the kitchen out of the house, making it communal and hiring cooks to lessen the burden of “women’s work.” Could Zittel’s heady innovations be postmodern descendants of these ideas?

But perched on a stool with the oil lamp and a book, the night astonishingly silent save for a lone coyote in the distance, I realized that Zittel isn’t interested in changing society or achieving political or social perfection, but is instead seeking liberation of a more private sort. Because here’s the strange thing: I never did get bored, or lonely, or restless during my stint in Zittel’s world. For all my physical discomfort throughout the week, I felt deeply, supremely calm. Existing alone in an unfamiliar space in which every detail has been considered and honed to its ultimate function was simultaneously soothing and stimulating. Engaged so closely with my immediate surroundings, I was able to drown out my ever-present anxieties. Bowls were no longer just bowls: They were the sole necessary vessel. Without a chair back, I sat up taller and lay down on the ground to watch the stars. I began to see the cabins as performance art, but with the artist herself absent — or, maybe, with the viewer taking the artist’s role. There was a kind of generosity, or trust, in that gesture.

Among the materials Zittel had left me — an idiosyncratic mix that included Viktor E. Frankl’s “Man’s Search for Meaning,” back issues of “Lapham’s Quarterly” and local travel guides — was an ancient paperback, “Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions.” First published in 1884 by Edwin A. Abbott, an English theologian who wrote the novel under the pseudonym A. Square, it is an Euclidean sci-fi fantasy about a civilization of polygons who inhabit an alternate two-dimensional reality — not my usual genre, but during the long nights, I gave myself over to the barely sublimated satire of Victorian values.",Sight and Insight in the California Desert,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/t-magazine/andrea-zittel-artist-cabin.html

But it was the Astros who had the last word in the 10th inning, and while their clubhouse was a mixture of exhaustion and elation afterward, the Dodgers were resolute.

“This is not going to be finished on Tuesday,” said Los Angeles outfielder Yasiel Puig. “There is going to be a Game 7.”

In a World Series that has come to be defined by the unpredictable and unexpected, it was only fitting that one night, after a lights-out pitchers’ duel between the heretofore unremarkable Alex Wood and Charlie Morton, a slugfest would unfold that sent the Cy Young Award winners Clayton Kershaw and Dallas Keuchel to early exits.

And Puig’s two-run homer off Chris Devenski in the ninth inning, which brought the Dodgers within 12-11, was the 22nd of the Series, breaking the previous record, set in 2002 by the San Francisco Giants and the Anaheim Angels over seven games.

Photo

“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve said this is the craziest game of my life,” said Musgrove, who blanked the Dodgers in the 10th inning to get the win. “I mean, again, tonight, this is the craziest game of my life.”

In this series, the Astros have shown not only lockdown starting pitching, dynamic defense and the type of prodigious power that invites bat flips. They have also flaunted the resilience of a champion.

Twice the Astros have rallied against one of baseball’s best closers, Kenley Jansen, and twice on Sunday they rallied against the best pitcher in baseball, Kershaw, who had dominated the Astros in a 3-1 victory in Game 1.

Nobody better exemplified that bounce-back than Springer, the Astros’ center fielder.

The Dodgers had taken an 8-7 lead in the seventh when Springer made a running dive and missed Cody Bellinger’s liner, which bounced past him and allowed Enrique Hernandez to score all the way from first.

A more cautious — and prudent — play for Springer would have been to pull back and concede the base hit. But one reason the Astros are here is their superlative defense, which had rescued them moments earlier when reliever Brad Peacock threw out Justin Turner at third on Hernandez’s bunt.

But Springer atoned on the first pitch of the bottom of the seventh, hammering a fastball from Brandon Morrow far over the left-field wall.

“That’s about as low to about as high as you could probably feel,” Springer said. “I made a bad decision. I tried to make a play, but I should have stopped. But then to come out and tie it, that’s a feeling that I don’t think I can ever describe to anybody.”

Springer’s was the third home run of the game for the Astros at that point — and both of the previous two, a three-run blast by Yuli Gurriel in the fourth off Kershaw and a three-run drive by Jose Altuve in the fifth off Kenta Maeda, had also tied the score.

“This was by far the craziest game I’ve ever been a part of and will probably ever be a part of,” said Bellinger, who hit a three-run homer in the fifth off Collin McHugh that gave the Dodgers a lead.

The Astros were not done after Springer’s home run. Bregman followed him with a sharp single, and Altuve added a drive into the left-center gap, chasing Bregman home to put the Astros ahead for the first time, 9-8.

With the crowd still on its feet, Carlos Correa hit a towering fly ball to left that seemed to scrape the roof of the ballpark, the type of shot that would be a home run in an elevator shaft — or, as it turns out, in Minute Maid Park.

Left fielder Joc Pederson drifted to the wall, but the ball landed in the first row of the Crawford Boxes — the left-field seats that abut Crawford Avenue outside the ballpark. When the ball settled in the stands, Correa — who had stopped near first base — pounded his chest and pointed to his teammates in the first-base dugout as the orange-clad crowd erupted again.

Corey Seager’s double in the eighth closed the gap to 11-9, but Peacock stranded two runners to keep the Dodgers at bay. McCann added a solo homer in the bottom of the inning to restore the three-run lead, but again it was not enough.

After Puig’s one-out homer in the ninth brought the Dodgers within one, Barnes followed with a double and advanced to third on a groundout. Taylor then delivered, lining a 2-2 changeup from Devenski up the middle.

He shook his fist as he reached first base, signaling that the Dodgers were not done. Neither, though, were the Astros.

In the 10th, McCann was hit by a pitch from Jansen, advanced to second on a walk to Springer and then was pinch-run for by Fisher, who crossed the plate to end it.

“Drama is at an all-time high,” McCann said. “You’re on every pitch, your focus is through the roof. You have to be ready for anything, thinking two, three steps ahead, constant communication. It’s more mentally exhausting than physically.”

But for a 13-year veteran playing in his first World Series, there were no complaints. A good night’s sleep and a trip to Los Angeles awaited.

Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Photo

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

Dancing has been illegal at the vast majority of the city’s bars since 1926, because of an archaic “Cabaret Law” that was originally intended to crack down on speakeasies during Prohibition. The City Council is set to repeal it.

“The only thing we are asking is to move our bodies rhythmically. That’s it,” said one club owner.

Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity — not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: “Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood? I could be the size of Marlon Brando in ‘Apocalypse Now,’ who’s going to know?”

You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with “Star Wars,” which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal. The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.

But Mr. Hamill isn’t bitter or jaded, and he isn’t Luke, though he has retained some of that character’s incorruptibility. He’s gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing “Star Wars” war stories.

At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought “Star Wars” into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.

“I’m such a fraud,” he said with a theatrical air. “But I’m enjoying all the residual attention that the movie’s getting. I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn. What’s not to love?”

On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin. The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to “Star Wars” — it’s mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamill’s own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of “Return of the Jedi.”

Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up. In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; he’ll slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues — the adenoidal clip of the “Star Wars” creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.

In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was “King Kong.”

Proudly recalling a fight scene from “Return of the Jedi,” Mr. Hamill said, “For me, sitting in the rancor’s hand, I was going all Fay Wray — it’s like a major accomplishment to me. But it was always that way. I’d say ‘Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3PO’s cereal!’”

The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings. He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.

When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could. “If I didn’t get a part, no problem,” he said. “Then where do I go? I sell tickets. I make props. I make posters. I don’t have to be in the show – I want to be near the show.”

He landed early roles on “General Hospital” and “The Partridge Family.” And then, of course, came “Star Wars”: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.

Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects. “I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity,” Mr. Lucas said. He added that Mr. Hamill “brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character,” and that “made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first ‘Star Wars.’”

Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience. “I thought, even if this thing doesn’t slay at the box office, it’s got midnight cult movie written all over it,” he said. “Move over, ‘Rocky Horror,’ ‘Star Wars’ is here!”

Instead, “Star Wars” became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford — even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them “Harry and Carrison” — as they promoted the movie together.

When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed “adequately,” Mr. Hamill “uninspiredly” and Ms. Fisher “wretchedly,” Mr. Hamill said, “We had T-shirts made: ‘adequate, uninspired and wretched.’ I said, ‘Harrison, adequate’s practically a rave compared to what we got.’”

Mr. Ford said that during this time, “the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness. We really were figuring this out as we went along.” Mr. Hamill struck him as “a very bright, sincere young actor,” who Mr. Ford said “seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.”

Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the “Star Wars” royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now. Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: “He’s a brilliant actor — that’s a given,” he said. “He’s also a leading man. When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.” Mr. Hamill believed he’d find his destiny on a different path — one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.

After two blockbuster sequels, “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980 and “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the “Star Wars” story was complete. With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in “The Elephant Man.” “I wasn’t getting character parts in movies and television,” he explained. “Unless you’re Meryl Streep, they don’t let you do accents.”

He starred in the Broadway production of “Amadeus” while “Return of the Jedi” was still in theaters. But his 1985 musical “Harrigan ’n Hart,” about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.

Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his “Star Wars” legacy. He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on “The Simpsons,” he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of “Guys and Dolls.” Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.

He was always comfortable being part of the “Star Wars” subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for “ultra-passionate fans”).

“It’s clearly not for everyone — I get that,” Mr. Hamill said. “But the passion of it all is just astonishing. The way it’s become part of the fabric of their lives — ‘I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia’ — it’s moving.”

He was not involved in the much-maligned “Star Wars” prequels from 1999 to 2005. And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new “Star Wars” trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate. “We figured we had the middle three,” he said. “It was over.”

When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, “I was completely stunned. Carrie, not a minute went by — she slapped the table and goes, ‘I’m in!’ I said, ‘Carrie, poker face!’”

Mr. Hamill needed more time to think. “I was just really scared,” he said. “I thought, why mess with it? The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.”

He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their “Star Wars” heyday. “No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star,” he said. “It’s sad.”

Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse “The Force Awakens,” expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.

“He’s too old and too rich and too cranky,” Mr. Hamill said. “He’s not going to do this.” But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: “Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no? I’d be the most hated man in nerd-dom.”

Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of “Star Wars” fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists. But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of “The Force Awakens,” and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Luke’s story line. (The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)

“The idea of it was so enormous,” Mr. Abrams said. “It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters. That had to be the next movie.”

Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in “The Force Awakens.” “I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal,” Mr. Abrams said. “I don’t think he knew just how minimal until he read it.”

In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was “not particularly happy with how little he was in it.”

Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Luke’s big reveal at the end would fall flat. “If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if there’s a big groan in the house, the egg’s on my face, not J.J.’s,” he said.

Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read — he jokingly calls it a “table listen” — of the “Force Awakens” script. He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration. (“I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse,” Mr. Hamill said.) Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.

Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in “The Force Awakens,” lamented that they had worked together on the early “Star Wars” movies far less than viewers realize.

“The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few,” he said. “I knew Chewbacca better.”

Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, “aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.”

“He’s very centered in his own experience and his own life,” Mr. Ford said. “He’s not a grandstander. He’s a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and that’s what we’re there for.”

Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in “The Force Awakens” — “when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, that’s fabulous,” he said.

But now he and the “The Last Jedi” creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.

“I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this,” said Rian Johnson, the “Last Jedi” writer and director. “Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.”

Mr. Johnson said “The Last Jedi” also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke. “In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with — the youthfulness and innocence — he now embodies a person full of soul and experience,” Mr. Johnson said.

While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the “Star Wars” filmmakers on big plot points — he’s still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister — he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in “The Last Jedi.”

“That’s the hard part,” Mr. Hamill said. “You don’t want to admit how possessive you’ve become. There are times where you go, ‘Really? That’s what they think of Luke? I’m not only in disagreement – I’m insulted.’ But that’s the process and you thrash it all out.”

The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December. Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent — someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to “Star Wars.”

Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his “Star Wars” work, he said, “She goes, ‘What’s your problem?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.’ She goes, ‘I am Princess Leia. You’re Luke Skywalker. Get used to it.’”

More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.

“She deserved that second act,” he said. “Harrison was more prominent in VII, I’m more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one. Her timing was perfect, except in this case.”

His “Star Wars” colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise — “He’s the last man standing,” said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in “The Force Awakens.”

But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.

“It means what it means to him, and that’s all that matters,” he said. “I’m sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and” — his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone — “that it’s all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.”

Photo

Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either. Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original “Star Wars” movies outside of theaters and has seen “The Force Awakens” only twice.

During production of “The Force Awakens,” he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker — Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt — and was struck by what he saw. “They were all great,” Mr. Hamill said. “They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.”

One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is “A Hard Day’s Night,” Richard Lester’s madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.

As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, “I saw it originally going, ‘Oh, can you imagine it? Girls chasing me down the street! It looks like so much fun.’” But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light. “It’s like a horror movie,” he said. “They’re trapped. They can’t go anywhere.”

One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamill’s mind was the “Can’t Buy Me Love” sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.

“It’s the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy,” Mr. Hamill said. “It plays so differently now, when you’re on the other end of it.”",Luke Skywalker Speaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-mark-hamill.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

THURSDAY PUZZLE — I will not hold a grudge against the constructor Jacob Stulberg just because he made a puzzle that was bound to make me remember how bad I am at this particular kind of theme. The reason I will not hold a grudge is because the theme itself is very clever and almost a parody of the form. And I can appreciate a good parody.

But if I were going to hold a grudge, this would be the perfect puzzle over which to do it.

Today’s Theme

Because rebuses. I just don’t see them. It’s a flaw in my brain. My best piece of advice to anyone who asks how to recognize whether there is a rebus element in their crossword is to say that if you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of your expected answers fit, it is more than likely that it’s a rebus theme. And even with that bit of knowledge in my brain, I still miss them.

The trick today is to make your way down to the revealer at 59A as early as possible, and hope to high heaven that you know your active volcanos. MT. EREBUS is the southernmost active volcano (You’re welcome) and if you break the name up, you might get MTE REBUS.

While the indictment of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates did not touch directly on collusion, it made clear that the two were paid tens of millions of dollars over years leading up to the campaign by Ukrainian political leaders allied with Russia and that their efforts to defraud continued through their time with the campaign until early this year.

In the past, the president has signaled that he might dismiss Mr. Mueller if the special counsel exceeded what Mr. Trump considers the mandate of his investigation. Mr. Trump has also publicly noted that he has the “complete power to pardon” relatives, aides and possibly even himself in response to the special counsel investigation.

Democrats quickly warned Mr. Trump on Monday not to impede Mr. Mueller’s investigation. “The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader. “If he does so, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally, and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the indictment showed that Mr. Mueller “is doing his job” and that the process was working. “I’ll continue to support Bob Mueller as he follows the facts — his independence must remain sacrosanct,” she said.

Even before the indictment was unsealed, Mr. Trump’s supporters argued that it would not mean much if it were focused on Mr. Manafort’s private business activities rather than the campaign.

“This could be a big old nothing burger if it was pre-campaign, but post-campaign it’s going to be serious stuff,” Representative Sean Duffy, Republican of Wisconsin, said on CNN. He added: “To taint Donald Trump with things Manafort did before the campaign, I think, is a leap too far.”

Mr. Manafort, a longtime Washington lobbyist and Republican operative, ran Mr. Trump’s campaign for several months last year before being dismissed in August 2016 amid questions about his work for Ukraine’s since-ousted pro-Russian government. Mr. Trump and his aides have since sought to minimize Mr. Manafort’s importance to the president, despite reports that Mr. Manafort remained in contact with the White House even after the inauguration in January.

In March, Sean Spicer, then the White House press secretary, said Mr. Manafort had only a “limited role for a very limited amount of time.” In August, after Mr. Manafort’s house was searched by the F.B.I., Mr. Trump said, “He was with the campaign, as you know, for a very short period of time, relatively short period of time.”

But the president’s political opponents on Monday eagerly distributed a tweet from last year from Sean Hannity, the Fox News host and friend of Mr. Trump’s, quoting Newt Gingrich, another Trump ally, boasting of Mr. Manafort’s role. “Nobody should underestimate how much Paul Manafort did to really help get this campaign to where it is right now,” Mr. Gingrich was quoted saying.

Mr. Trump started the morning seeking again to turn attention to the Democrats, as he did over the weekend. In his first tweet of the day, he focused on the firm that helped produce a dossier of salacious allegations against Mr. Trump during last year’s campaign and its links to Democrats who helped finance it.

“Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS,” Mr. Trump wrote. “The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?) from DNC. Nobody knows who OK’d!”

He did not mention the fact that the firm that conducted the research for the dossier was originally hired during the Republican primaries by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website financed in large part by a prominent Republican donor, the hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer.

After Mr. Manafort was brought to an F.B.I. office on Monday morning, Mr. Trump sought again to turn the tables on Democrats. “But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????” he wrote as part of his tweet dismissing the indictment of Mr. Manafort.

Democrats said the Manafort indictment made clear how serious Mr. Mueller’s investigation has become.

“After Mr. Trump whipped up a tweet storm of suspicion about Mueller this weekend, he really now has no place to go with this attack,” said Robert Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama. “Mueller’s first charge is beyond any potential claim of ‘politics’ or ‘stretching’ that the president might wish to bring against him and his office. To the extent that Mueller needed any early credibility for his office under hostile fire, this does the job, and then some.”

Mr. Trump has no public events on his schedule on Monday until 5:45 p.m. when he and the first lady were due to participate in a Halloween event on the South Lawn. His press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is scheduled to conduct her daily briefing at 1:15 p.m.

Ty Cobb, the White House special counsel focused on the investigation, said last week that the president is not worried about anything that Mr. Manafort or Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser, might tell prosecutors about Mr. Trump.

“The president has no concerns in terms of any impact, as to what happens to them, on his campaign or on the White House,” Mr. Cobb told The New York Times.

“He likes and respects Mr. Manafort and appreciates the work he did for him during the three months he was with the campaign. He likes General Flynn personally, but understands that they have their own path with the special counsel,” Mr. Cobb added. “I think he would be sad for them, as a friend and a former colleague, if the process results in punishment or indictments. But to the extent that that happens, that’s beyond his control.”","For Trump, Indictment of Former Top Lieutenant Raises the Stakes",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/trump-manafort-indictment-analysis.html

But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”

Expect to hear this line repeatedly from the president and his defenders: The indictments, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy, are a vindication of President Trump because he was not charged and because of the absence of allegations about campaign collusion with Russia. But they’re wrong — the president should be very worried.

For one thing, it is now clear that President Trump closely relied upon Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates while they were engaged in alleged criminal activity. That is a damning indictment of the president’s judgment. Their prosecution will hang over him and his administration for the foreseeable future, since these proceedings will continue for many months, and perhaps years. And these are unlikely to be the last of the charges pursued by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, who is also reported to be looking at other actors, including the president himself.

The idea that Mr. Manafort’s indictment vindicates Mr. Trump also ignores how complex criminal investigations typically proceed, and the attendant peril Mr. Trump now faces. In our half century of collective experience prosecuting and defending criminal cases, we have watched repeatedly as prosecutors charged lower-level individuals with readily provable offenses that are distinct from the core conduct and targets that are the primary focus of the prosecutor’s investigation.

It’s also significant that Mr. Mueller threw the book at Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates. Because the federal sentencing guidelines recommend a significant prison sentence for money-laundering offenses and are largely driven by the dollar amounts involved in the crime, this indictment, which involves millions of dollars, puts tremendous pressure on them to make a cooperation deal with the special counsel’s office to try to reduce the lengthy prison sentences each could face.

The power of this “squeeze play” approach is demonstrated by the other filing released today, reflecting a guilty plea by George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser who admits to communications with foreign individuals during the campaign, including at least one about the Russians’ possessing “dirt” concerning Hillary Clinton “in the form of ‘thousands of emails.’ ” Mr. Papadopoulos lied about these engagements when questioned, and was caught doing so.

Hope Exiner d’Amore said Harvey Weinstein raped her in a hotel room in the 1970s, when he was a young concert promoter in Buffalo. Cynthia Burr said that during this time, he assaulted her in an encounter that began in an elevator and ended with forced oral sex in a hallway. Ashley Matthau, a dancer with a bit part in one of his movies, said that in 2004, he pushed her down on a bed and masturbated while straddling her. Days later, she said, he paid her to remain silent.

Three weeks after complaints of sexual harassment and misconduct by Mr. Weinstein were first reported in The New York Times, women from different continents, fields and generations have come forward with allegations of rape, sexual assault and groping. New accounts include one previously undisclosed settlement with Mr. Weinstein and expand the time frame of alleged wrongdoing to the 1970s.

Together, the accounts provide a widening tally of alleged abuses, and illustrate the toll on women who say they felt ashamed and isolated as they watched the Hollywood producer walk red carpets, pile up Oscars and showcase his ties to prominent figures.

“This has haunted me my entire life,” said Ms. Exiner d’Amore, now 62, who was in her early 20s at the time of the alleged rape.

She and three other women who spoke to The Times described Mr. Weinstein as inappropriate and unrelenting. Some said that he used the pretext of work to lure them to hotels, that he touched them or forced them into unwanted sexual activity and that he wouldn’t stop when they said no.

Ms. Matthau, the dancer who reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, said she was willing to break its confidentiality clause even if it meant that he might pursue legal damages. “I want to do my part to help bring this to light so it doesn’t happen with other people in Hollywood or anywhere else,” she said in an interview.

The allegations add to those previously documented in The Times , The New Yorker and elsewhere.

Last week, the actress Dominique Huett filed a lawsuit claiming that in 2010, Mr. Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. The same day, Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant of Mr. Weinstein’s, appeared at a news conference in New York accusing him of the same behavior in 2006.

The New York Police Department is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of allegations against Mr. Weinstein. Detectives with expertise in old cases are reviewing complaints that have come through the department’s hotline, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses. Ms. Burr, the woman involved in the hallway encounter in the 1970s, said that she contacted the New York police in recent weeks and that they told her the alleged assault had happened too long ago to be prosecuted.

Women have also spoken to law enforcement authorities in London, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States. The London police are investigating three sexual assault cases involving Mr. Weinstein, ranging from the 1980s to 2015.

Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement that “any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Cynthia Burr

For 40 years, Cynthia Burr has almost never talked about the time she met Mr. Weinstein.

But she didn’t forget how he greeted her in the lobby of a beautiful old building in New York City. How he tried to kiss her in the elevator. And how, she said, he unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway.

“It was just him and me alone,” she said. “I was fearful I didn’t have the wherewithal to get away.”

It was the late 1970s, and Ms. Burr was an actress in her early 20s. Mr. Weinstein was in his mid-20s and a “real up-and-comer,” Ms. Burr remembers. Her manager said they should meet.

After the encounter, she recalls feeling ashamed. “The way he forced me made me feel really bad about myself,” she said. “What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.”

Ms. Burr, now 62, went on to build a career in Hollywood. She appeared in “Scarface” and the first two “Lethal Weapon” films, and in soap operas and other television shows.

Eventually, she told her husband, now deceased, and a close friend, Lee Chavez, what had happened. Mr. Chavez confirmed that she had told him her account about 10 years ago.

“I’m really sad for everybody, but I’m really glad it’s out in the open,” Ms. Burr said about learning of the other allegations against Mr. Weinstein. “I finally felt like I had a voice.”

Hope Exiner d’Amore

Ms. Exiner d’Amore had worked for Mr. Weinstein for just a few weeks when he asked if she’d like to take a trip to New York City. Both of them were in their 20s, living in Buffalo in the late 1970s.

She was working for Mr. Weinstein’s concert promotion company, Harvey and Corky Productions, doing odd jobs. She was interested in film, so when Mr. Weinstein asked if she wanted to come to New York City to meet with people in the industry, she agreed.

When they got to the Park Lane Hotel, Mr. Weinstein went to the check-in desk while she waited elsewhere in the lobby, Ms. Exiner d’Amore recalled. He returned and said there had been a mistake with the reservations; there was only one room. They would have to share.

“I gave him a look like that was ridiculous,” she recalled. But she ultimately agreed, assuming it was harmless. When she got into bed that night, she said, he slipped in next to her, naked.

“I told him no. I kept pushing him away. He just wouldn’t listen,” Ms. Exiner d’Amore said. “He just forced himself on me.” She said he forcibly performed oral sex and intercourse on her.

She did not tell her boyfriend, feeling ashamed, but she did confide in her next-door neighbors in Buffalo. She did not specifically say she was raped, but the couple, David and Irene Sipos, told The Times that they remembered her being extremely upset and crying when she told them about Mr. Weinstein and the hotel room.

After the trip, Ms. Exiner d’Amore said, Mr. Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her credit cards to go on shopping sprees. She declined. Within three or four weeks, she was fired.

“It was a relief,” she said. “I hated being there.”

Ms. Exiner d’Amore never went into the film industry. She got a job administering an undergraduate program at Cornell, and later moved on to jobs in fund-raising.

Ashley Matthau

Ashley Matthau said that Mr. Weinstein was aggressive with her the moment they met in 2004. She was in Puerto Rico performing in “Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights” when Mr. Weinstein visited the set. As soon as he saw her, she said, he began pressuring her to come to his hotel room for a private meeting. Ms. Matthau, who then went by her maiden name, Anderson, said she tried to brush him off, explaining that she was engaged. She said he persisted.

When the cast broke for a meal, Ms. Matthau told some production members that Mr. Weinstein was being pushy and she was afraid. No one offered to help, she said, and when she returned to the set, Mr. Weinstein instructed her to get into a car.

“‘Don’t worry,’” Ms. Matthau, now 36, remembers him saying as they sat in the back seat. “‘Nothing is going to happen. We’re just going to discuss future projects.’”

She said they went to his hotel room, where talk quickly became sexual: Mr. Weinstein told her that he had helped launch the careers of high-profile actresses who had slept with him, and that she should consider doing the same. When she declined, Mr. Weinstein pushed her onto the bed and fondled her breasts, she said. He then stripped, straddled her and masturbated on top of her.

“I kept telling him, ‘Stop, I’m engaged,’ but he kept saying: ‘It’s just a little cuddling. It’s not a problem. It’s not like we’re having sex.’ ”

Back in California days later, Ms. Matthau tearfully told her fiancé, Charles Matthau, a general description of what had happened. Mr. Matthau said in an interview that he was outraged. With his encouragement, Ms. Matthau retained John S. West, a partner in the law firm of Gloria Allred, who has a record of taking on powerful men.

Soon, Ms. Matthau recalled, she and Mr. West met at the Peninsula Beverly Hills with Mr. Weinstein and Daniel M. Petrocelli, who had represented high-profile clients including Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron.

The experience, she said, was chilling. She had attended a couple of parties at the Playboy Mansion, and Mr. Petrocelli said she would be painted as promiscuous if she went public with her accusation against Mr. Weinstein.

“‘We’ll drag you through the mud by your hair,’” she recalled the lawyer saying. Mr. Petrocelli declined to comment.

Going up against such powerful men felt like more than she could handle. Ms. Matthau said she agreed to enter into a more than $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in exchange for a legally binding promise never to speak of the allegations again.

Lacey Dorn

Lacey Dorn moved to New York City in 2011, soon after graduating from Stanford University, where she had helped create two documentaries. Ms. Dorn, then 22, was introduced to Mr. Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party

A few weeks later, Ms. Dorn attended a Halloween party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and ran into Mr. Weinstein, who asked for her email. He wanted to talk about her career over lunch, she said.

“Great meeting you,” he wrote in the subject line of an otherwise blank email sent to her at 12:26 a.m.

On her way out of the party, Ms. Dorn said goodbye to Mr. Weinstein. As she turned her back to him, he grabbed between her legs, touching her buttocks and crotch through her clothes.

“I was so naïve, I didn’t say anything. And he didn’t say anything either,” she said. “I just got out of the party as fast as possible.”

Ms. Dorn said she never heard from Mr. Weinstein and never spoke to him again. Ms. Dorn said that when she told friends what had happened, many seemed to shrug it off as if it were a “rite of passage,” an acknowledgment of how “awful” the entertainment business could be.

Importantly, the White House expects Mr. Quarles, and not the next Fed chairman, to take the lead role in sorting out these questions.
Mr. Trump can also stock the Fed’s board with officials committed to deregulation.","Choosing Mr. Powell would reflect a judgment by the Trump administration that it can loosen Wall Street’s chains even without the enthusiastic participation of the next Fed chairman. Mr. Trump likes Ms. Yellen’s approach to monetary policy, which has yielded strong economic growth and low unemployment, and aides including Mr. Mnuchin have argued that appointing Mr. Powell is the best way to maintain continuity while satisfying Republican demands that Ms. Yellen be replaced, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly about them.

Mr. Trump has already chosen Randal K. Quarles to lead the push for deregulation at the Fed. Mr. Quarles was sworn in earlier this month as the Fed’s first vice chairman for supervision, a position created after the financial crisis to oversee the Fed’s work on regulatory issues.

Administration officials have also told some conservatives that Mr. Powell is more sympathetic to deregulation than may be suggested by his public comments, according to a person who participated in one such meeting, and described it on condition of anonymity.

But some independent analysts and congressional Republicans argue that choosing Mr. Powell would be a gamble.

Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, which tracks regulatory issues for financial industry clients, said that she expected Mr. Powell would defer to Mr. Quarles. “That said,” she continued, “Powell will generally favor course corrections, not redirections.”

Mr. Powell’s regulatory views are also raising eyebrows among conservatives on Capitol Hill. Mr. Powell joined the Fed in 2012 but, because of a procedural quirk, he had to be confirmed again in 2014. Twenty-three Republicans voted against him, with several citing his record of support for new financial regulations; all but two of those senators are still serving.

“Senator Scott is looking for fresh leadership at the Federal Reserve, and Mr. Powell would have to answer serious concerns both old and new at any potential nomination hearing he might have before the Senate Banking Committee,” said a spokesman for Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican who voted against Mr. Powell’s confirmation.

If Mr. Trump does not choose Ms. Yellen, she would become the first person in the Fed’s modern history to complete a term as chairman without being nominated for a second. A major reason is that the White House does not share her views on financial regulation. In a speech in August, she warned against forgetting the lessons of 2008.

“The events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented and these reforms have made the system safer,” she said.

Mr. Taylor’s outspoken critiques of the Fed’s economic stimulus campaign have won him the backing of conservatives including Vice President Mike Pence, according to the people familiar with the internal discussions. But his comments about regulatory issues have been less frequent and less critical of regulation. He has said that banks were allowed to take too many risks before the crisis and, in a 2015 interview, he said he had “no problem” with requiring the biggest banks to raise more capital after the crisis.

Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress argue that excessive financial regulation, much of it created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, is inhibiting economic growth.

The Trump administration in June released a plan for reducing regulation, much of which can be carried out by the Fed and other regulators without legislation. The changes would exempt smaller banks from many postcrisis regulations, and loosen restrictions on larger banks. That would let banks borrow more freely, and take more risks with that money.

At a hearing a few weeks after the plan was released, Mr. Powell offered a tepid review. “I see it is a mixed bag,” he said. “There are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness.” But, he added, “There are some ideas that I would not support.”

Since joining the Fed in May 2012, Mr. Powell has voted in favor of every action to tighten regulation the Fed has undertaken. But he has sometimes expressed concerns in internal discussions about the effects of those decisions, and about the aggregate weight of so many new regulations.

At the June hearing, he said that there were clear opportunities for improvement.

“The whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work,” he said.

Specifically, Mr. Powell wants to overhaul the Volcker Rule, which is intended to prevent big banks from making certain kinds of risky investments with their own money. Mr. Powell and other Fed officials have long regarded the rule as costly and ineffective, in part because they say it duplicates other measures aimed at limiting risk-taking.

He said regulators were working on revisions that would limit its application to smaller banks and loosen the strictures on larger banks.

Mr. Powell also expressed support for cost-benefit analysis of proposed rules, an idea backed by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers. He said the Fed was pushing to improve its analysis of regulatory costs. “We have an obligation to make our regulation no more costly than it needs to be,” he said.

And he has endorsed greater transparency regarding the Fed’s annual “stress tests” of large banks, aimed at assessing their ability to weather economic downturns.

But on the issue at the center of the debate over regulation, Mr. Powell broke ranks with the administration. Banking regulators have significantly limited the use of borrowed money as a source of funding, requiring banks to raise more capital.

The Trump administration has proposed a host of changes to loosen those restrictions. Mr. Powell said he supported the current regulations.

“I happen to think we’ve gotten it about right,” he said.

Importantly, the White House expects Mr. Quarles, and not the next Fed chairman, to take the lead role in sorting out these questions.

Mr. Quarles’s job was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to sharpen the Fed’s focus on regulation. At his confirmation hearing in July, he echoed Mr. Powell’s characterization of postcrisis regulation as a rough draft that required editing.

“Regulatory policies enacted since the financial crisis have improved the safety and soundness of the financial system,” Mr. Quarles said. “But as with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefit of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order.”

Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles are friends. The two men were colleagues at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm based in Washington.

Mr. Trump can also stock the Fed’s board with officials committed to deregulation. There are seven seats on the board, and Mr. Trump can quickly fill as many as six of those seats with his own nominees, assuming Ms. Yellen steps down in February.

The presidents of the regional reserve banks, some of whom are proponents of financial regulation, only vote on monetary policy.","In Choice of Fed Chairman, Trump Downgrades Deregulation",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/business/federal-reserve-chairman-trump.html

Instead, it describes in granular detail Mr. Manafort’s lobbying work in Ukraine and what prosecutors said was a scheme to hide that money from tax collectors and the public. The authorities said Mr. Manafort laundered more than $18 million.

“Manafort used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States without paying taxes on that income,” the indictment reads.

Mr. Gates is accused of transferring more than $3 million from offshore accounts. The two are also charged with making false statements.

“As part of the scheme, Manafort and Gates repeatedly provided false information to financial bookkeepers, tax accountants and legal counsel, among others,” the indictment read.

Mr. Papadopoulos admitted that in a January interview with the F.B.I., he lied about his contacts with a Russian professor, whom he knew to have “substantial connections to Russian government officials,” according to court documents. Mr. Papadopoulos told the authorities that the conversation occurred before he became an adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign. In fact, he met the professor days after joining the campaign.

The professor took interest in Mr. Papadopoulos “because of his status with the campaign,” the court documents said.

Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates surrendered to the F.B.I. early on Monday and, through their lawyers, pleaded not guilty to all charges on Monday. The two men, wearing dark blue suits, entered the courtroom with their hands held behind their backs. Money laundering, the most serious of the charges, carries a potential prison sentence of up to 20 years.

Mr. Manafort has expected charges since this summer, when F.B.I. agents raided his home and prosecutors warned him that they planned to indict him. That warning raised speculation that Mr. Manafort might try to cut a deal to avoid prosecution. A senior White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, said last week that the president was confident that Mr. Manafort had no damaging information about him.

People close to Mr. Manafort, including his former business partner Roger J. Stone Jr., have said he had nothing to offer that would help prosecutors build a case against Mr. Trump.

“He’s not going to lie,” Mr. Stone said in September.

Mr. Gates is a longtime protégé and junior partner of Mr. Manafort. His name appears on documents linked to companies that Mr. Manafort’s firm set up in Cyprus to receive payments from politicians and businesspeople in Eastern Europe, records reviewed by The New York Times show.

Attempts to reach Mr. Gates on Monday were not successful. A spokesman for Mr. Manafort did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican strategist, joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 to help keep delegates from breaking with Mr. Trump in favor of establishment Republican candidates. Mr. Trump soon promoted him to chairman and chief strategist, a job that gave him control over day-to-day operations of the campaign.

But Mr. Trump fired Mr. Manafort just months later, after reports that he received more than $12 million in undisclosed payments from Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president and a pro-Russia politician. Mr. Manafort spent years as a political consultant for Mr. Yanukovych.

American intelligence agencies have concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia launched a stealth campaign of hacking and propaganda to try to damage Hillary Clinton and help Mr. Trump win the election. The Justice Department appointed Mr. Mueller III as special counsel in May to lead the investigation into the Russian operations and to determine whether anyone around Mr. Trump was involved.

Mr. Trump has denied any such collusion, and no evidence has surfaced publicly to contradict him. At the same time, Mr. Trump and his advisers this year repeatedly denied any contacts with Russians during the campaign, only to have journalists uncover one undisclosed meeting after another.

The New York Times revealed in July that Mr. Manafort and others close to Mr. Trump met with Russians last year, on the promise of receiving damaging political information about Mrs. Clinton.","Paul Manafort, Ex-Chairman of Trump Campaign, and Associate Plead Not Guilty to Money Laundering",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort-indicted.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The company acknowledged that it has suffered from a buyer backlash against diesel, long one of its strongest selling points.
Volkswagen sales in Western Europe, its core market, rose 1 percent.
In a positive development, Volkswagen made more money from its namesake brand than it did last year.","Volkswagen has announced ambitious plans to offer a lineup of battery-powered vehicles beginning in late 2019 that would be affordable for middle-class buyers. Herbert Diess, the head of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars, has said that he sees Tesla as a more important competitor than traditional rivals like Toyota.

The German company aims to deploy its enormous manufacturing network to churn out battery-powered cars faster, and in greater volume, than Tesla, which has had trouble meeting demand. But those plans may be difficult to reconcile with cuts in the research and development budget.

The diesel scandal remains a dead weight on the company’s finances and reputation. Volkswagen said Friday that legal settlements and other costs related to the emissions cheating have drained €14.5 billion this year from company coffers. That is money that Volkswagen would certainly prefer to spend developing new products.

Volkswagen might be able to find savings in other areas, for example, by diverting money that could have been used to develop new diesel engines, said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management at the Fachhochschule der Wirtschaft, a technical university in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.

Still, Mr. Bratzel said, “it really hurts that this money is gone and is not available for the future.”

The damage from the scandal, Volkswagen said in a statement, was “nowhere near an end and would continue to necessitate great efforts throughout the entire group.”

Andreas Hoffbauer, a Volkswagen spokesman, said the company was responding to investors who have long complained that the research and development budget was spent inefficiently and was too large compared with rivals’ budgets.

The good news for the carmaker was that sales in the third quarter rose 6 percent, to €55 billion, thanks in part to a new SUV model introduced in the United States and economic recovery in Latin America.

But there were also signs of trouble. In Germany, where Volkswagen has long dominated the market for affordable cars, sales fell 2 percent even as most competitors recorded sales gains. The company acknowledged that it has suffered from a buyer backlash against diesel, long one of its strongest selling points.

In a reflection of growing anger in Germany toward Volkswagen, despite its position as a pillar of the economy, the number of lawsuits by aggrieved diesel owners has almost tripled to 4,600, the company said. Unlike the United States, Germany does not allow class-action suits by owners, who take a considerable financial risk by suing Volkswagen as individuals.

Volkswagen sales in Western Europe, its core market, rose 1 percent. But the overall market in the region rose faster and the company’s share has slipped so far this year.

The company acknowledged in the earnings report that one reason for the mediocre performance in Europe was “the fact that customer confidence has not yet been fully restored following the diesel issue and to customer uncertainty generated by the public discussion on driving bans for diesel vehicles.”

London’s city government this week began imposing a daily charge of 10 pounds, or $13.20, on older diesel cars to drive in the city center, on top of the existing congestion charge of £11.50 per day. Other cities like Stuttgart and Munich are also considering restrictions on diesels, which are blamed for high levels of harmful nitrogen oxides.

In a positive development, Volkswagen made more money from its namesake brand than it did last year. Operating profit from cars with the VW logo doubled to €2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier.

But the company remains dependent on its luxury brands Audi and Porsche, which generated more than twice as much profit, even though they sell fewer cars.

Climbing the back stairs to Hillary Huffard’s apartment in Alameda, Calif., several weeks ago, as the sun negotiated the cloudy afternoon sky, I glanced down. My hands and forearms were stained maraschino red, and a ripe whiff of fish sauce, garlic and ginger enveloped me. I lowered my gaze to the garden, where my friend Julya Shin, the co-chef of Nokni, a Korean pop-up restaurant in Oakland, was teaching a couple of suspicious first graders how to season, stuff and fold Napa cabbage kimchi. Huffard stood a few feet away, pouring tastes of a small-batch beer she recently brewed for the adults, while Shin’s husband passed out plates of Korean glass noodles.

I was feeling awkward. All I’d wanted was to bring a bunch of people together to make and eat mandu, the Korean pot-stickers I was obsessed with as a teenager. But had I roped too many innocent people into this latest scheme? I’d asked Shin to teach us how to make the mandu of her childhood, and she asked Huffard and her husband to let us assemble them in their garden. Now a dozen guests — some of whom I knew well and others I had just met — were elbow deep in kimchi.

Just then, one of the kids asked Shin to slow down. He couldn’t keep all of the steps of the process straight. “I’ve spent the last 20 years working toward total efficiency in the kitchen,” Shin muttered incredulously, “and you’re asking me to slow down?” Then she took the boy’s hand gingerly into her own and showed him how to fold the cabbage parcel.

I met Huffard only a week earlier, but at that moment we made eye contact and laughed at our uniquely grumpy friend. And I felt the distinct relief of a host who finally knows her party is going to be a success.

At this point in my cooking life, everyone I know is aware that, explicitly stated or not, a dinner invitation from me is also a mandate to pick herbs, grate cheese, chop vegetables, roll out dough, set the table and wash the dishes. It might not be the most conventional way to host, but dinner with me means cooking with me, no matter your level of confidence or skill. I love the way cooking together unfailingly puts everyone at ease, so when I’m in charge, the cooking is the party, rather than an obstacle to overcome on the way to pleasure with my guests.

I learned how to be a cook, guest and host simultaneously as I stepped into young adulthood. While in college, I bused tables at a white-tablecloth restaurant. Watching the veteran servers, I learned the importance of making guests feel comfortable and keeping their glasses filled with wine. When I moved into the kitchen, I was trained to move quickly and resist my urge to chat. Working alongside detail-oriented purists six days a week, I instantly intuited that nothing less than perfection was acceptable when cooking and caring for others. But on Sundays, when the restaurant was closed and we gathered at one another’s homes to cook, eat and drink, my colleagues gave me a glimpse of another sort of hospitality, one that was much more relaxed and natural. While I grew to love the ceremonial details of restaurant service — the heated plates, multiple wineglasses and candlelit tables — the thought of experiencing all that formality as a dinner guest made me itch.

On Sundays, we ate off the chipped plates and stained tablecloths we could no longer use in the restaurant. We drank house wine. Sometimes a chef who was trying to quell an obsession led everyone in making a particular shape of pasta or variety of sausage. But others took the lead, too: The porter taught us to make his mother’s Nepalese momos and the Guatemalan intern showed us how to fold tamales. I lived for Sundays, when having a task to keep my hands busy allowed me to relax around my colleagues. I began to enjoy the company of the very people who intimidated me the rest of the week and started to believe that maybe they enjoyed mine, too.

Table Talk Don’t leave some guests nodding their heads and pretending they know what’s going on. Often, clarification is required. If a guest is mumbling, restate a phrase for people who couldn’t hear what was said. If a guest makes an inside joke, go ahead and laugh — and then put it in context for everyone.

Over time, I combined everything I learned about cooking and entertaining on work days and Sundays and sifted out anything superfluous to generating satisfaction and joy. What’s left behind makes up my hosting philosophy: If cooking for people is an act of generosity, then cooking with them is also an act of empowerment.

Over the course of my last dozen dinners, friends have come over to work a lasagna assembly line in the garage, fold tamales on the living-room floor and hand-crank ice cream in the park. We’ve made paella and fried churros over an open fire and rolled mounds of fresh masa into stacks of chewy, steamy corn tortillas to eat with mole. It doesn’t matter what we’re cooking; success is simply the result of achieving a balance of rigor and relaxation, of preparation and freedom.

Sometimes I get the balance wrong. My most spectacular failure was my 30th-birthday party, when, having grown overconfident after a series of successful dinners, I didn’t do any food preparation. I didn’t even buy a can of mixed nuts. Instead, I asked friends to arrive around noon and envisioned everyone seated around a huge bowl massaging Moroccan clarified butter into fluffy steamed couscous as the sun went down. I spent all my preparatory energy hanging strands of garden lights and art-directing a homemade piñata covered in fresh bay leaves and stuffed with handmade caramels.

Suffice it to say, hungry children cried all afternoon, mothers dug into emergency granola-bar stashes and the artisanal caramels were barely enough to prevent the onset of mass hypoglycemia before dinner was served long after sunset. (In my defense, it was an extraordinary piñata. And eight years on, it’s all anyone remembers.)

Table Talk The sad truth is, no one cares what you have to say; they care about what they have to say. Deep down, people want to feel they’ve been heard. They will if you let them talk.

Learn from my mistakes. For your first cooking party, make sure everyone is fed and save yourself from having to choreograph the simultaneous preparation of multiple menu items. Choose one or at most two dishes for your guests to focus on. The best foods to prepare en masse are time- and labor-intensive. They require rolling and pinching, stuffing and folding. They leave behind massive piles of dirty dishes and flour-strewn floors. And best of all, they yield excellent leftovers for everyone to share.

Next, you’ll need abundant work space. It doesn’t have to be in the kitchen, though. A dining table, an oilcloth spread on the living-room floor or card tables in the basement or on the patio will all work fine. My own apartment is tiny, so for big projects, I’ll persuade a friend or a friend of a friend to host with the promise of those leftovers.

Invite eight or 10 of your friends, neighbors, family and everyone’s kids, too. You’ll be surprised by how willing the pickiest little ones are to gobble up dumplings filled with unfamiliar ingredients just because they folded them themselves. Make sure your guests know you’ll be cooking for a few hours before you sit down to eat. Mention whether they should bring aprons, rolling pins, freezer bags or glass jars to transport home their spoils. And if you’re cooking with tomatoes, chiles or pomegranates, tell them to leave their white pants at home.

Prepare for your cooking party by doing a little cooking on your own. It doesn’t have to be complicated; just have enough snacks and drinks on hand to prevent mutiny. Then, make a couple of accompaniments to round out the meal. Choose room-temperature dishes that will be at home on the table alongside the project foods: cabbage slaw with tamales; an antipasti platter with ravioli.

When your guests arrive, encourage them to eat snacks and drink drinks. Then, once they’re jolly and full, put everyone to work, starting with the messiest, most time-consuming part of the project. Demonstrate the steps involved, assign each person to a position on the assembly line and let everyone begin. Take a moment to appreciate your grand vision being realized. Don’t get too smug, though, because someone will soon start to fret that he’s not getting the hang of it, and you will inevitably see some attrition among the ranks. Don’t worry. Just keep on cooking and assure your guests that perfection is beside the point. No matter how they look, all of the mandu or ravioli will taste the same when you sit down to eat.

And when the meal is over, don’t forget to send everyone home with leftovers — but not until after they’ve helped you do the dishes.

It’s the worst drug overdose epidemic in American history, spurred by rising drug abuse, increased availability of prescription opioids and an influx of potent synthetics like fentanyl and carfentanil. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50.

“It’s horrifying,” said Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a heroin researcher and a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “It’s not even the magnitude — it’s the steepness at which it’s climbing.” Preliminary numbers for 2017 suggest that overdose deaths are growing at a rate comparable to the height of the H.I.V. epidemic.

The number who die each year from...

The opioid epidemic has not fallen equally on all races or regions. Like an infectious disease, drug overdoses have emerged in clusters around the country.

Among those 15 to 44 — the age group in which drug overdose accounts for the greatest share of deaths — there are vast differences across racial categories and between urban and rural places. Despite the perception of the epidemic as primarily afflicting the rural working class, drug overdoses account for a greater percentage of deaths among the young in large cities and their suburbs, with urban and suburban whites most at risk.

Percentage of deaths in 15-to-44-year-olds caused by drug overdoses Note: In counties with fewer than 10 drug overdose deaths, the map combines observed totals with modeled estimates

The crisis has hit particularly hard in New England and in parts of Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Those are the places where fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, started to flood into the heroin supply five to 10 years ago. Bodies began piling up.

“It just blew through all the measures we’d been taking,” said Dr. Alex Walley, the director of the Boston University Addiction Medicine Fellowship program. Fentanyl, which acts on opioid receptors in the brain but isn’t made from the opium poppy, is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Because of that potency, Dr. Walley said, there’s less time after an overdose for someone to intervene. The drug’s short half-life means that users have to inject more frequently, increasing the risk of transmitting H.I.V., hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases.

The illicit fentanyls being added to the heroin supply also vary widely in purity and quality. This unpredictability kills: Users often don’t realize the strength of what they’re taking until it’s too late.

An evolving epidemic

The country's struggles with opioids go back centuries, but the current epidemic has roots in the 1980s, when a few studies made doctors less wary of prescribing opioids for pain. Pharmaceutical manufacturers began aggressively marketing them for many ailments, particularly after OxyContin, a controlled-release opioid, hit the market in 1996. Soon, narcotics that had been reserved for cancer patients and end-of-life care found their way into medicine cabinets across the country.

Michael Botticelli, the executive director of the Grayken Center for Addiction Medicine at Boston Medical Center and former White House drug czar, said that rampant over-prescription of painkillers had actually been decreasing in the last few years. “We’d turned a corner on that,” Mr. Botticelli said, “but we’ve seen the continued escalation of overdose deaths in many states.”

Some experts argue that the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, undertaken when addiction treatment was insufficient, pushed people toward heroin and inadvertently drove up the rate of overdose deaths. Mr. Botticelli said that theory isn’t supported by the data.

Regardless of the cause, there is little disagreement that heroin addiction has evolved into a full-fledged crisis of its own. “Young people are flocking to heroin,” Dr. Ciccarone said. Halting prescription opioid abuse will probably not be enough to stop the growing number of deaths.

What can be done

The Trump administration has established a commission, led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study responses to the epidemic. The commission’s final report is expected in November.

Among public health researchers, there is broad agreement about what's needed: access to addiction treatment and medications; tighter regulation of prescription opioids; widespread distribution of naloxone, a fast-acting overdose antidote; needle exchanges or supervised injection centers; and law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, the bulk of which is thought to come from China and Mexico.

“This is not a hopeless situation,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., describing interdiction as a critical piece of the strategy. “If law enforcement can substantially interfere with the supply of illicit opioids, it will save a lot of lives.”

He and other experts expressed hope for new partnerships between law enforcement and public health. Cooperation would, for example, allow public health workers to pinpoint groups of drug users who may be amenable to treatment or identify particularly deadly batches of drugs before they kill.",You Draw It: Just How Bad Is the Drug Overdose Epidemic?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/14/upshot/drug-overdose-epidemic-you-draw-it.html

Another point worth pondering is how it is that President Trump chose as his campaign chair someone like Manafort whose reputation in the political world was less about his political brilliance than about his ties to Russia and Ukraine (including some of the most corrupt people there) and his general shadiness. It’s said that Jared Kushner was among those advocating to hire Manafort, so the obvious question is: Why?

Maybe there simply wasn’t adequate vetting, even though news organizations quickly found problems that led to Manafort’s firing. But the inclination to hire someone so close to Moscow does raise questions about the Trump inner circle’s predilection to hire someone linked to Russia and Ukraine.

We’re still not sure whether there was collusion between President Trump and Russia, but we certainly do know that Russia interfered with the U.S. election and may even have affected the outcome, although that is impossible to know for sure. Nothing could be more serious, or more deserving of careful investigation.

President Trump tweeted this morning that there was “no collusion” and again urged greater focus on the supposed crimes of Hillary Clinton. By that he presumably means the uranium deal, which has conservatives in a frenzy—but it is simply absurd to think that there is some parallel.

Look, it was The Times that in 2015 helped uncover and publicize the uranium arrangement, but it has been flagrantly taken out of context by Fox News and its ilk. For starters, there seems to be a suspicion on the right that American uranium is going to Russia, while in fact there’s no export license—so the uranium stays in America. More important, this was a non-controversial deal that an interagency committee approved, apparently unanimously, at a level far below Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Every bit of evidence says that Clinton never even weighed in on it. So the notion that this is somehow a serious scandal parallel to Moscow’s work to overturn an American presidential election is just comical.

One peril ahead is that President Trump may engage in riskier or more aggressive behavior vis-à-vis North Korea so that people will rally around the flag. Another is that Trump will fire Mueller. This would be difficult for him to do, because (opinions vary) he might have to do this through the Justice Department framework, leading to another Archibald Cox-style massacre of reluctant intermediaries. But it would also be a body blow to the rule of law in America, and it would trigger a Constitutional crisis.

Any firing of Mueller would lead many fair-minded people to assume that Trump is hiding criminal behavior, perhaps treason. There would be a push for impeachment, a boost to Congressional investigations, and the presidency would be hobbled—along with the United States itself—for years to come. Trump set in motion today’s actions when he fired James Comey, and I hope he understands that firing Mueller would probably also set in motion the complete unraveling of his presidency.",Will Manafort Sing?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/paul-manafort-indictment-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Papadopoulos admitted that in a January interview with the F.B.I., he lied about his contacts with a Russian professor, whom he knew to have “substantial connections to Russian government officials,” according to court documents. Mr. Papadopoulos told the authorities that the conversation occurred before he became an adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign. In fact, he met the professor days after joining the campaign.

The professor took interest in Mr. Papadopoulos “because of his status with the campaign,” the court documents said.

Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates surrendered to the F.B.I. early on Monday and, through their lawyers, pleaded not guilty to all charges on Monday. The two men, wearing dark blue suits, entered the courtroom with their hands held behind their backs.

Mr. Manafort has expected charges since this summer, when F.B.I. agents raided his home and prosecutors warned him that they planned to indict him. That warning raised speculation that Mr. Manafort might try to cut a deal to avoid prosecution. A senior White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, said last week that the president was confident that Mr. Manafort had no damaging information about him.

People close to Mr. Manafort, including his former business partner Roger J. Stone Jr., have said he had nothing to offer that would help prosecutors build a case against Mr. Trump.

“He’s not going to lie,” Mr. Stone said in September.

Mr. Gates is a longtime protégé and junior partner of Mr. Manafort. His name appears on documents linked to companies that Mr. Manafort’s firm set up in Cyprus to receive payments from politicians and businesspeople in Eastern Europe, records reviewed by The New York Times show.

Attempts to reach Mr. Gates on Monday were not successful. A spokesman for Mr. Manafort did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican strategist, joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 to help keep delegates from breaking with Mr. Trump in favor of establishment Republican candidates. Mr. Trump soon promoted him to chairman and chief strategist, a job that gave him control over day-to-day operations of the campaign.

But Mr. Trump fired Mr. Manafort just months later, after reports that he received more than $12 million in undisclosed payments from Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president and a pro-Russia politician. Mr. Manafort spent years as a political consultant for Mr. Yanukovych.

American intelligence agencies have concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia launched a stealth campaign of hacking and propaganda to try to damage Hillary Clinton and help Mr. Trump win the election. The Justice Department appointed Mr. Mueller III as special counsel in May to lead the investigation into the Russian operations and to determine whether anyone around Mr. Trump was involved.

Mr. Trump has denied any such collusion, and no evidence has surfaced publicly to contradict him. At the same time, Mr. Trump and his advisers this year repeatedly denied any contacts with Russians during the campaign, only to have journalists uncover one undisclosed meeting after another.

The New York Times revealed in July that Mr. Manafort and others close to Mr. Trump met with Russians last year, on the promise of receiving damaging political information about Mrs. Clinton.","Paul Manafort, Ex-Chairman of Trump Campaign, and Associate Plead Not Guilty to Money Laundering",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort-indicted.html

但没错，在锡吉什瓦拉市保存完好的市中心——下方有一个酷刑室——还伫立着一座中世纪的钟楼，据说，在中世纪统治瓦拉几亚地区（后来成了罗马尼亚的一部分）的穿刺公弗拉德(Vlad the Impaler)，于1431年诞生在街对面的房子里。很多人都认为他是德古拉这个虚拟人物的原型，不过一些人对此表示怀疑。布兰城堡(Bran Castle)也值得一提，得益于与虚构的以及历史上的德古拉之间可疑的关联，它或许是特兰西瓦尼亚最知名的旅游景点。

位于英国约克郡海岸的这个风景如画的小镇，也自称是德古拉的家，不过是以另一种方式。布莱姆·斯托克(Bram Stoker)只在惠特比待过一个月，不过，1890年七八月份的那四个星期，在他最知名的作品《德古拉》的创作过程中至关重要。该书出版于1897年。惠特比于2015年庆祝了斯托克到访125周年，但在今年10月的最后一周，你可以看到灯光映衬下的惠特比修道院(Whitby Abbey)废墟。

作为1690年代臭名昭著的女巫审判的发生地，这个城镇毫不奇怪地成了万圣节活动的温床。在长达一个月的死人节(Festival of the Dead)中，塞勒姆通过包括通灵仪式、降神会、万圣节舞会、以悼念为主题的茶会等相关活动为其幽灵四伏的过往增光添色，万圣节当天晚上还有女巫大聚会。要了解更多信息，可查看该市致力于介绍其他大量万圣节主题活动的官方网站。

也有很多与女巫无关的事可做，比如造访皮博迪艾塞克斯博物馆(Peabody-Essex Museum) 。该博物馆发端于1799年，其前身是东印度航海协会(East India Marine Society)，一个“自然和人造奇观陈列室”，在曾经的岁月里，当地参与对华贸易的船长，纷纷捐出走南闯北觅得的物件。你还可以去参观七个尖角阁的房子(House of the Seven Gables)，它因纳撒尼尔·霍桑( Nathaniel Hawthorne)1951年的小说而闻名于世。

很多人都认为万圣节源于古代盖尔人的萨温节，也就是德里居民的祖先们过的一个节日。德里（又称伦敦德里）去年被《今日美国》(USA Today) 的读者票选为万圣节首选目的地，为了赢得这样的荣誉，它似乎每年都竭尽全力。去年，约8万人参加了每年一度的德里万圣节庆祝活动。

德里做了很多工作，来摆脱它作为北爱问题发源地的动荡往昔。所谓北爱问题，是指北爱尔兰民族主义者和寻求让北爱尔兰继续隶属于英国的新教徒“保皇派”之间长达三十年的斗争。德里的核心景观是于2011年开通、高耸在福伊尔河(River Foyle)上方的和平桥(Peace Bridge)。",想过个“弥漫惊悚”的万圣节？别错过这6个地方,https://cn.nytstyle.com/style/20171030/6-spooky-travel-destinations-for-the-halloween-season/

It’s a canonical book in Spain. Here was a highly cultivated poet reworking Andalusian folk culture and myth. The high-low effect was startling. It was as if Robert Lowell had made a murderous little book that drew its inspiration from Harry Smith’s “Anthology of American Folk Music.”

The poet and translator Sarah Arvio is here now with “Poet in Spain,” a new translation of Lorca’s poems into English. It is the first major undertaking of its kind since “Collected Poems: A Bilingual Edition” (1991), the work of several translators and edited by Christopher Maurer.

Unlike Maurer, Arvio omits Lorca’s intemperate and political and Whitman-inflected New York poems, written after he visited the city in 1929 and 1930. (These were published after his death under the title “Poet in New York.”) She focuses instead entirely on what she calls his “moonlit earthbound Spanish poems.”

About Lorca’s New York versus his Spanish poems, Arvio writes, “To my ear, these voices are so different they could almost be the voices of two different poets.” The crucial word here is “almost.” The absence of these vital poems immediately renders Arvio’s book less necessary than Maurer’s in terms of seeing this complicated poet whole.

There are consolations. Arvio is a supple translator, and she has delivered a personal book. She has felt free to shift Lorca’s poems around in sequence, as he himself often did when putting together his books. Most notably she has shorn the poems of punctuation, as Lorca sometimes did in his drafts.

The spare effect can be riveting. Take this snippet of “Dreamwalking Ballad”:

Compadre can I swap

my horse for your house

saddle for your mirror

knife for your blanket

compadre I come bleeding

from the Cabra passes

If I could young friend

the deal would be done

But I’m no longer me

my house isn’t mine

At other moments, the punctuation is missed. You feel Lorca has been tamped down. His poem “Cazador” (“Hunter”), for example, begins with these words: “¡Alto pinar!” Arvio translates this, with a vast diminution in energy, as “High grove of pines.”

Lorca wrote in an exclamatory style that gave his work a flamenco brashness. Witness the first stanza of “Árboles” (“Trees”) from 1919:

¡Árboles!

¿Habéis sido flechas

Caídas del azul?

¿Qué terribles guerreros os lanzaron?

¿Han sido las estrellas?

Arvio renders this in telegraphic yet somewhat lobotomized fashion:

Were you once arrows

falling from the sky

What terrible warriors shot you

Were they the stars

At other moments, Arvio’s translations are both less accurate and less felicitous than those in Maurer’s edition. The opening lines of “Reyerta” (“Brawl” or “Feud”), for example, read this way: “En la mitad del barranco / las navajas de Albacete, / bellas de sangre contraria, / relucen como los peces.”

Arvio gives us this translation: “Halfway down the gully / the blades from Albacete / glisten like fishes / flush with fighting blood.”

In Maurer’s book, it is: “Halfway down the gorge / knives of Albacete, / beautiful with enemy blood, / shine like fish.”

Beautiful with enemy blood. That isn’t just a gorgeous phrase, ripe with meaning, but it comports more exactly with Lorca’s Spanish.

The poems in this book include not only “Gypsy Ballads,” but the “Dark Love Sonnets,” with their death-haunted homoeroticism, and poems about the deadly goring of Lorca’s friend the bullfighter Ignacio Sánchez Mejías, among others.

Lorca’s poems from Spain are a poetry of dreams and journeys and glimpses from balconies, of sunbaked meadows and realms of erotic yearning. He went to the well often for the same elemental imagery: the sea, the wind, the moon, flowers and trees. His mind worked feverishly enough to induce hallucinations.

He completed 13 plays and nine books of verse between 1917 and 1936. This book includes one of those plays, a rich and gripping retranslation of “Blood Wedding,” written in 1932. It’s an unconventional choice to print it in a book of poems, but Arvio argues and then demonstrates that the language in it is of a piece with Lorca’s blood-warm verse.

He said the controversy had begun to detract from the work being done to restore power on the island.

Soon after the deal with Whitefish was announced, questions were raised as to how a two-man company from Montana managed to secure such a lucrative contract. The company has ties to the secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, but both sides say there was no wrongdoing.

A House committee is investigating, and the governor has asked the island’s comptroller and the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security to also review the deal.

The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported Monday that F.B.I. agents from the San Juan field office are investigating the contract, but such an investigation could not be confirmed.

The F.B.I. national office referred questions about the report to the Puerto Rico field office. A spokesman there, Carlos Osorio, said the agency could not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation.

A spokeswoman for the power authority said the agency had no information about an investigation, and therefore had no comment.

The governor’s office said it welcomed an inquiry.

“We have not received any information about the F.B.I. looking into the contract, but Governor Rosselló welcomes any investigation by the federal authorities and he has been clear: there should be an investigation on this matter, and if there is any wrongdoing, the persons responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” said Yennifer Álvarez, the governor’s spokeswoman. “That’s why the Governor has asked for investigations by the Comptroller of Puerto Rico and the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, John Roth.”

In a phone interview, Ms. Farha, an independent expert reporting to the United Nations, said it was “very worrying” that she had not been able to obtain clarity on the number of people who were still homeless after the storm. She noted that estimates of the number of houses destroyed ranged from 30,000 to 90,000.

Thousands of engineers had been deployed in Texas and Florida to reconnect homes to the electricity grid after hurricanes hit those states, a number far in excess of the crews deployed to Puerto Rico.

“FEMA is overall responsible,” Ms. Farha said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “I don’t understand why FEMA can respond so quickly and affirmatively in Texas and why they weren’t deployed similarly in Puerto Rico.”

Obamacare lifted an enormous financial burden that women alone had to bear. Before the A.C.A., 85 percent of health insurance plans at large companies offered contraceptive coverage, but most required at least a co-payment. Individual women paid about $250 a year. Now the president has given insurance companies a way out of taking on that burden.

The Trump administration has tried to reassure women that they can still get inexpensive birth control, asserting that “many forms of contraception are available for around $50 a month.” Even if that’s the case, $50 a month — $600 a year — is no small item in many people’s budgets, particularly for the women who make up a majority of low-wage workers. As the Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has pointed out, the cost of an intrauterine device, one of the most effective forms of contraception, is about the same as a month’s minimum-wage pay.

This doesn’t just matter to individual women. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of all economic growth, and women are responsible for an outsize portion of that spending. Billions of dollars less a year in their pockets means billions of dollars less that they could spend on goods other than birth control, dampening their ability to support businesses and the economy.

But a larger economic impact of reconstructing a cost barrier to contraception is likely to be felt throughout the entire work force. High birth rates have historically lowered women’s ability to get and keep paid work, which isn’t so hard to understand — holding down a job becomes a lot more difficult when it has to be balanced with pregnancies and raising children. That’s particularly true if women aren’t even in control of when they become pregnant.

On the other hand, a raft of evidence has definitively found that when women gained greater access to the pill in the late 1960s and early ’70s, they were able to delay marriage and childbirth and invest in careers through education, job training and staying in paid work.

Legal access to the pill transformed the economy in that era. It increased young women’s labor force participation by 7 percent. Those who were able to get it the earliest because of relaxed state laws worked significantly more hours than those who couldn’t get it until later. In fact, about a third of the increase in how many women attained careers in fields like law and business was due to birth control.

Women with earlier access to the pill also made 8 percent more than their peers, and the pill was responsible for about a third of the decrease in the gender wage gap by 1990.

Birth control is still playing the economic role that it did in the 1970s. About half of women who use it say they do so to complete education or to get and keep a job. Contraception is still increasing the share of women who get educated and get paid work, particularly prestigious jobs.

President Trump has promised to gin up the economy so that it’s growing at 4 percent a year or more, something it hasn’t done for a sustained amount of time for over a decade. That kind of growth will be extremely difficult to reach without policy interventions, and tax changes or tough talk on trade won’t cut it.

One clear way to spur economic growth is to entice more people to participate in it. The high growth rates during the Reagan years were linked in part to women continuing to enter the workplace. But women are already trickling out of the work force, and it could get worse with more unexpected pregnancies.

We don’t know yet how many employers will opt out of providing their employees with no-cost birth control under Mr. Trump’s rule change. Women who work at the employers that do opt out could face yet another barrier to staying in the labor force.

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily.

Consider, for example, that New Orleans won Sunday without Drew Brees, the starting quarterback, throwing a touchdown pass, which had not happened in eight seasons. The Saints’ stellar running back, Mark Ingram, nearly gave the game away to the Chicago Bears twice with fumbles in the fourth quarter, but Ingram’s defensive teammates bailed him out each time.

There have not been many games in recent years when the New Orleans defense outshined the offense. But except for one 50-yard carry by Chicago running back Jordan Howard, the Saints held the powerful Howard to 2.36 yards per carry.

The Vikings were trailing Cleveland at halftime and led by only a touchdown entering the fourth quarter. Then Minnesota’s front seven sacked Browns quarterback DeShone Kizer three times in the next three Cleveland possessions, and Keenum deftly led the Vikings to a runaway victory.

As for the Eagles, even when not playing their best — and that was the case in a 33-10 romp over the San Francisco 49ers (0-8) on Sunday — they still make winning look easy. Having a defense that held the 49ers to 238 yards and sacked the quarterback four times helps considerably.

Granted, some of the current N.F.C. division leaders have not yet weathered the more challenging portions of their schedules. Then again, as teams that did not make the playoffs a year ago, they generally have less arduous schedules than those of teams that bulled their way into last year’s postseason. It’s called the spoils of parity.

But as the N.F.L. schedule rounds the halfway pole and churns toward a still distant finish line, there are new contenders, a couple of surprising, conspicuous laggards and some struggling old powerhouses desperately trying to catch up.

The allegations add to those previously documented in The Times, The New Yorker and elsewhere.

Last week, the actress Dominique Huett filed a lawsuit claiming that in 2010, Mr. Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. The same day, Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant of Mr. Weinstein’s, appeared at a news conference in New York accusing him of the same behavior in 2006.

The New York Police Department is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of allegations against Mr. Weinstein. Detectives with expertise in old cases are reviewing complaints that have come through the department’s hotline, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses. Ms. Burr, the woman involved in the hallway encounter in the 1970s, said that she contacted the New York police in recent weeks and that they told her the alleged assault had happened too long ago to be prosecuted.

Women have also spoken to law enforcement authorities in London, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States. The London police are investigating three sexual assault cases involving Mr. Weinstein, ranging from the 1980s to 2015.

Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement that “any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

“It was just him and me alone,” she said. “I was fearful I didn’t have the wherewithal to get away.”

It was the late 1970s, and Ms. Burr was an actress in her early 20s. Mr. Weinstein was in his mid-20s and a “real up-and-comer,” Ms. Burr remembers. Her manager said they should meet.

After the encounter, she recalls feeling ashamed. “The way he forced me made me feel really bad about myself,” she said. “What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.”

Ms. Burr, now 62, went on to build a career in Hollywood. She appeared in “Scarface” and the first two “Lethal Weapon” films, and in soap operas and other television shows.

Eventually, she told her husband, now deceased, and a close friend, Lee Chavez, what had happened. Mr. Chavez confirmed that she had told him her account about 10 years ago.

She was working for Mr. Weinstein’s concert promotion company, Harvey and Corky Productions, doing odd jobs. She was interested in film, so when Mr. Weinstein asked if she wanted to come to New York City to meet with people in the industry, she agreed.

When they got to the Park Lane Hotel, Mr. Weinstein went to the check-in desk while she waited elsewhere in the lobby, Ms. Exiner d’Amore recalled. He returned and said there had been a mistake with the reservations; there was only one room. They would have to share.

“I gave him a look like that was ridiculous,” she recalled. But she ultimately agreed, assuming it was harmless. When she got into bed that night, she said, he slipped in next to her, naked.

“I told him no. I kept pushing him away. He just wouldn’t listen,” Ms. Exiner d’Amore said. “He just forced himself on me.” She said he forcibly performed oral sex and intercourse on her.

She did not tell her boyfriend, feeling ashamed, but she did confide in her next-door neighbors in Buffalo. She did not specifically say she was raped, but the couple, David and Irene Sipos, told The Times that they remembered her being extremely upset and crying when she told them about Mr. Weinstein and the hotel room.

After the trip, Ms. Exiner d’Amore said, Mr. Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her credit cards to go on shopping sprees. She declined. Within three or four weeks, she was fired.

“It was a relief,” she said. “I hated being there.”

Ms. Exiner d’Amore never went into the film industry. She got a job administering an undergraduate program at Cornell, and later moved on to jobs in fund-raising.

Ashley Matthau

Ashley Matthau said that Mr. Weinstein was aggressive with her the moment they met in 2004. She was in Puerto Rico performing in “Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights” when Mr. Weinstein visited the set. As soon as he saw her, she said, he began pressuring her to come to his hotel room for a private meeting. Ms. Matthau, who then went by her maiden name, Anderson, said she tried to brush him off, explaining that she was engaged. She said he persisted.

When the cast broke for a meal, Ms. Matthau told some production members that Mr. Weinstein was being pushy and she was afraid. No one offered to help, she said, and when she returned to the set, Mr. Weinstein instructed her to get into a car.

“‘Don’t worry,’” Ms. Matthau, now 36, remembers him saying as they sat in the back seat. “‘Nothing is going to happen. We’re just going to discuss future projects.’”

She said they went to his hotel room, where talk quickly became sexual: Mr. Weinstein told her that he had helped launch the careers of high-profile actresses who had slept with him, and that she should consider doing the same. When she declined, Mr. Weinstein pushed her onto the bed and fondled her breasts, she said. He then stripped, straddled her and masturbated on top of her.

“I kept telling him, ‘Stop, I’m engaged,’ but he kept saying: ‘It’s just a little cuddling. It’s not a problem. It’s not like we’re having sex.’ ”

Back in California days later, Ms. Matthau tearfully told her fiancé, Charles Matthau, a general description of what had happened. Mr. Matthau said in an interview that he was outraged. With his encouragement, Ms. Matthau retained John S. West, a partner in the law firm of Gloria Allred, who has a record of taking on powerful men.

Soon, Ms. Matthau recalled, she and Mr. West met at the Peninsula Beverly Hills with Mr. Weinstein and Daniel M. Petrocelli, who had represented high-profile clients including Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron.

The experience, she said, was chilling. She had attended a couple of parties at the Playboy Mansion, and Mr. Petrocelli said she would be painted as promiscuous if she went public with her accusation against Mr. Weinstein.

“‘We’ll drag you through the mud by your hair,’” she recalled the lawyer saying. Mr. Petrocelli declined to comment.

Going up against such powerful men felt like more than she could handle. Ms. Matthau said she agreed to enter into a more than $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in exchange for a legally binding promise never to speak of the allegations again.

Lacey Dorn

Lacey Dorn moved to New York City in 2011, soon after graduating from Stanford University, where she had helped create two documentaries. Ms. Dorn, then 22, was introduced to Mr. Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party

A few weeks later, Ms. Dorn attended a Halloween party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and ran into Mr. Weinstein, who asked for her email. He wanted to talk about her career over lunch, she said.

“Great meeting you,” he wrote in the subject line of an otherwise blank email sent to her at 12:26 a.m.

On her way out of the party, Ms. Dorn said goodbye to Mr. Weinstein. As she turned her back to him, he grabbed between her legs, touching her buttocks and crotch through her clothes.

“I was so naïve, I didn’t say anything. And he didn’t say anything either,” she said. “I just got out of the party as fast as possible.”

Ms. Dorn said she never heard from Mr. Weinstein and never spoke to him again. Ms. Dorn said that when she told friends what had happened, many seemed to shrug it off as if it were a “rite of passage,” an acknowledgment of how “awful” the entertainment business could be.",New Accusers Expand Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Claims Back to ’70s,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-allegations.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years.
Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about one million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections.
Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.
“Rules are rules.”","“I’m distressed that our company is responsible for something that could cast doubt on the quality of Japanese manufacturing,” Yasuyuki Yoshinaga, chief executive of Subaru Corporation, said at a news conference on Friday. “This will be reported around the world.”

The inspection problem involves final quality checks that automakers perform on vehicles before they leave factories for dealerships.

After a car rolls off an assembly line, workers look it over and run it on rollers to ensure it is in working order. Points on their checklists include: Do the seats adjust properly? Do the headlights shine at the correct angle? Does the speedometer work accurately?

Such checks are a standard part of automobile manufacturing. But in Japan, the law requires that carmakers produce a special certificate for every vehicle to show it has passed examination; only then can it be registered as road worthy.

Government guidelines specify that workers who conduct these inspections must be “qualified” — though the authorities leave the details up to manufacturers. The car companies have the responsibility of deciding what training is required and of authorizing employees to work as qualified inspectors.

Nissan and Subaru stumbled on that step. They allowed some workers who had not completed training programs or who had not been formally authorized to be “final inspectors” to perform the checks.

The corner-cutting appears to have been long-established. Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years. Nissan says it is still investigating the scope and duration of its failure, but several news reports have suggested that it too may have been using unqualified inspectors for decades.

Independent specialists say it is unlikely that the inspection practices resulted in unsafe cars.

Automotive manufacturers and their suppliers perform multiple safety tests during development and production, and serious but hard-to-find faults — say, unstable chemicals inside an airbag inflater, which are believed to have caused the Takata hazard — are unlikely to be spotted by a limited, mostly external once-over.

Some commentators have suggested that part of the blame belongs with Japanese regulators, whose guidelines regarding inspectors appear simultaneously burdensome and vague. Cars made for export are not subject to the same rules, because governments outside Japan do not require final vehicle inspections to be carried out by workers with special training and qualifications.

“The checks are a formality, and it would not be an exaggeration to say they require no special know-how,” Hisao Inoue, a veteran Japanese automotive journalist, wrote on the website of the magazine Gendai Business after the initial admission by Nissan.

He said the inspection regulations should be reviewed, though he added that it was “absolutely wrong” for Nissan to have broken the rules.

Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry study firm, said Nissan and Subaru had risked their reputations and shown a disregard for following the rules, but had probably not endangered their customers.

“It makes you question how well they are managing what’s happening on the factory floor,” Mr. Tsukuda said. “Even if there is not a safety problem, users of their products will feel uneasy.”

Mr. Tsukuda said a shrinking car market in Japan may have increased the temptation to cheat. The country’s automakers are selling more and more vehicles abroad, as demand at home declines because of Japan’s falling population. Nissan, for instance — a particularly foreign-focused producer — sells 90 percent of its cars outside Japan.

That increases the cost, relative to sales, of complying with domestic-only rules — in this case by putting workers through special courses to become authorized inspectors, a process that can take them away from their normal duties over a period of weeks or even months.

“The Japan market is becoming an afterthought,” Mr. Tsukuda said.

The carmakers’ crisis management capabilities are now being tested.

In particular, critics have complained that Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan’s chief executive, failed to show sufficient contrition at a news conference about the company’s lapse. In a country where apologies are highly ritualized, even his bow — briefer and shallower than those of most executives seeking the public’s forgiveness — became a target of criticism.

Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about one million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections. It said a much smaller group of employees — between four and 17 at any given time — who were studying to be inspectors but had not yet qualified, would also certify vehicles, contrary to government guidelines.

Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.

“It was not our intention to deceive anyone, but what we did was not appropriate,” Mr. Yoshinaga said. “Rules are rules.”","Subaru Admits Inspection Failings, in Another Blow to Japan’s Carmakers",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/business/subaru-inspection-japan.html

The arrest shows that Mr. Trump, who vowed during his campaign to fill the wartime prison at Guantánamo Bay with “bad dudes,” is willing to use civilian courts to prosecute terrorism suspects captured overseas. The capture also marks a victory for F.B.I. officials, who had feared that such prosecutions would stagnate under Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Mr. Sessions has said for years that terrorism suspects should be held and prosecuted at Guantánamo Bay. He has said that terrorists do not deserve the same legal rights as common criminals and that such trials were too dangerous to hold in the United States.

Earlier this year, the United States extradited a man suspected of belonging to Al Qaeda from Spain to stand trial in the United States. European allies refuse to release suspects to be sent to the prison at Guantánamo Bay, complicating Mr. Trump’s rhetoric about filling the prison but demonstrating the realities of fighting terrorism in 2017.

The F.B.I.’s Hostage Rescue Team has worked closely for years with the military’s elite units to make such arrests. In 2013, the F.B.I. team took part in an operation to arrest Ahmed Abu Khattala, who was charged in the Benghazi attack and is being tried in Federal District Court in Washington. If convicted, Mr. Khattala faces a potential sentence of life in prison.

It was not clear how the arrest of a second suspect could affect Mr. Khattala’s trial. But officials said Mr. Imam was one of the men filmed entering and leaving the diplomatic compound the night of the attack and was an associate of Mr. Khattala.

Mr. Imam, who is about 46, is accused of taking part in the attacks on the diplomatic compound and the C.I.A. base, according to prosecutors. He is charged in a criminal complaint with killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility involving the use of a firearm and dangerous weapon; conspiring to provide material support to terrorists resulting in death; and possession of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.

To capture Mr. Khattala, an F.B.I. agent and several Delta Force operators snatched him from a beachside villa on Libya’s coast, and Navy SEALs took him to a waiting warship, where he was interrogated. In another operation, Delta Force commandos and the F.B.I. captured an Al Qaeda suspect in 2013 as he returned home from morning prayers. He was taken to an American warship and had to be quickly flown to the United States because of serious health problems. He later died of liver cancer before he could stand trial.",Benghazi Attacks Suspect Is Captured in Libya by U.S. Commandos,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/africa/benghazi-attacks-second-suspect-captured.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to name Jerome H. Powell as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, replacing Janet L. Yellen, the current chairwoman whose term expires early next year, according to two people familiar with the plans.

An announcement could come as soon as Thursday, ahead of the president’s 12-day trip to Asia.

Mr. Powell, a Fed governor since 2012, is a Republican with deep roots in the party’s establishment and in the financial industry. He has steadily supported the Fed’s current approach to monetary policy and financial regulation, creating an expectation that he would bring continuity to the role.

One person familiar with the president’s thinking described Mr. Powell as the “safe” choice and the one who most closely fit Mr. Trump’s penchant for filling his government with characters from “central casting,” as he often puts it.

“These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty.","Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

Long story short, the “fair” way, in the story, to apportion that $20 discount would be to give most of it to the richest reporters, who were paying the most for drinks in the first place. That, in turn, would make the poorest reporters angry that they saved less than the richest ones.

“The nine reporters yelled at the tenth and made him feel bad,” Ms. Sanders said. “So the next night the tenth man didn’t show up for drinks, and the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They no longer had enough money between them all to even cover half of the bill.”

She concluded: “And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how our tax system works. The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally benefit from a tax reduction, but not the largest percent benefit. Taxing them too much — attack them — and they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.”

Never mind that Ms. Sanders seems to be making the case that rich Americans — these are personal taxes we are talking about, after all — might flee the country if the middle class gets a tax cut and they don’t. The point here is that the Trump administration is shifting away from the president’s own words. They’re not saying the rich shouldn’t get any tax relief — they’re saying the rich deserve to get one.

Mr. Trump famously does not drink. But that rhetorical shift might draw a toast from supply side conservatives, who have long argued that cuts at the top end are both deserved and necessary for economic growth, and some bottle smashing from Democrats, who have long criticized the president for saying one thing on taxes and proposing plans that do something quite different.",A White House Story Reveals Shifting Stance on Tax Cuts for the Rich,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/a-white-house-story-reveals-shifting-stance-on-tax-cuts-for-the-rich.html

The allegations add to those previously documented in The Times, The New Yorker and elsewhere.

Last week, the actress Dominique Huett filed a lawsuit claiming that in 2010, Mr. Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. The same day, Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant of Mr. Weinstein’s, appeared at a news conference in New York accusing him of the same behavior in 2006.

The New York Police Department is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of allegations against Mr. Weinstein. Detectives with expertise in old cases are reviewing complaints that have come through the department’s hotline, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses. Ms. Burr, the woman involved in the hallway encounter in the 1970s, said that she contacted the New York police in recent weeks and that they told her the alleged assault had happened too long ago to be prosecuted.

Women have also spoken to law enforcement authorities in London, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States. The London police are investigating three sexual assault cases involving Mr. Weinstein, ranging from the 1980s to 2015.

Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement that “any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Cynthia Burr

For 40 years, Cynthia Burr has almost never talked about the time she met Mr. Weinstein.

But she didn’t forget how he greeted her in the lobby of a beautiful old building in New York City. How he tried to kiss her in the elevator. And how, she said, he unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway.

“It was just him and me alone,” she said. “I was fearful I didn’t have the wherewithal to get away.”

It was the late 1970s, and Ms. Burr was an actress in her early 20s. Mr. Weinstein was in his mid-20s and a “real up-and-comer,” Ms. Burr remembers. Her manager said they should meet.

After the encounter, she recalls feeling ashamed. “The way he forced me made me feel really bad about myself,” she said. “What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.”

Ms. Burr, now 62, went on to build a career in Hollywood. She appeared in “Scarface” and the first two “Lethal Weapon” films, and in soap operas and other television shows.

Eventually, she told her husband, now deceased, and a close friend, Lee Chavez, what had happened. Mr. Chavez confirmed that she had told him her account about 10 years ago.

“I’m really sad for everybody, but I’m really glad it’s out in the open,” Ms. Burr said about learning of the other allegations against Mr. Weinstein. “I finally felt like I had a voice.”

She was working for Mr. Weinstein’s concert promotion company, Harvey and Corky Productions, doing odd jobs. She was interested in film, so when Mr. Weinstein asked if she wanted to come to New York City to meet with people in the industry, she agreed.

When they got to the Park Lane Hotel, Mr. Weinstein went to the check-in desk while she waited elsewhere in the lobby, Ms. Exiner d’Amore recalled. He returned and said there had been a mistake with the reservations; there was only one room. They would have to share.

“I gave him a look like that was ridiculous,” she recalled. But she ultimately agreed, assuming it was harmless. When she got into bed that night, she said, he slipped in next to her, naked.

“I told him no. I kept pushing him away. He just wouldn’t listen,” Ms. Exiner d’Amore said. “He just forced himself on me.” She said he forcibly performed oral sex and intercourse on her.

She did not tell her boyfriend, feeling ashamed, but she did confide in her next-door neighbors in Buffalo. She did not specifically say she was raped, but the couple, David and Irene Sipos, told The Times that they remembered her being extremely upset and crying when she told them about Mr. Weinstein and the hotel room.

After the trip, Ms. Exiner d’Amore said, Mr. Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her credit cards to go on shopping sprees. She declined. Within three or four weeks, she was fired.

“It was a relief,” she said. “I hated being there.”

Ms. Exiner d’Amore never went into the film industry. She got a job administering an undergraduate program at Cornell, and later moved on to jobs in fund-raising.

Ashley Matthau

Ashley Matthau said that Mr. Weinstein was aggressive with her the moment they met in 2004. She was in Puerto Rico performing in “Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights” when Mr. Weinstein visited the set. As soon as he saw her, she said, he began pressuring her to come to his hotel room for a private meeting. Ms. Matthau, who then went by her maiden name, Anderson, said she tried to brush him off, explaining that she was engaged. She said he persisted.

When the cast broke for a meal, Ms. Matthau told some production members that Mr. Weinstein was being pushy and she was afraid. No one offered to help, she said, and when she returned to the set, Mr. Weinstein instructed her to get into a car.

“‘Don’t worry,’” Ms. Matthau, now 36, remembers him saying as they sat in the back seat. “‘Nothing is going to happen. We’re just going to discuss future projects.’”

She said they went to his hotel room, where talk quickly became sexual: Mr. Weinstein told her that he had helped launch the careers of high-profile actresses who had slept with him, and that she should consider doing the same. When she declined, Mr. Weinstein pushed her onto the bed and fondled her breasts, she said. He then stripped, straddled her and masturbated on top of her.

“I kept telling him, ‘Stop, I’m engaged,’ but he kept saying: ‘It’s just a little cuddling. It’s not a problem. It’s not like we’re having sex.’ ”

Back in California days later, Ms. Matthau tearfully told her fiancé, Charles Matthau, a general description of what had happened. Mr. Matthau said in an interview that he was outraged. With his encouragement, Ms. Matthau retained John S. West, a partner in the law firm of Gloria Allred, who has a record of taking on powerful men.

Soon, Ms. Matthau recalled, she and Mr. West met at the Peninsula Beverly Hills with Mr. Weinstein and Daniel M. Petrocelli, who had represented high-profile clients including Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron.

The experience, she said, was chilling. She had attended a couple of parties at the Playboy Mansion, and Mr. Petrocelli said she would be painted as promiscuous if she went public with her accusation against Mr. Weinstein.

“‘We’ll drag you through the mud by your hair,’” she recalled the lawyer saying. Mr. Petrocelli declined to comment.

Going up against such powerful men felt like more than she could handle. Ms. Matthau said she agreed to enter into a more than $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in exchange for a legally binding promise never to speak of the allegations again.

Lacey Dorn

Lacey Dorn moved to New York City in 2011, soon after graduating from Stanford University, where she had helped create two documentaries. Ms. Dorn, then 22, was introduced to Mr. Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party

A few weeks later, Ms. Dorn attended a Halloween party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and ran into Mr. Weinstein, who asked for her email. He wanted to talk about her career over lunch, she said.

“Great meeting you,” he wrote in the subject line of an otherwise blank email sent to her at 12:26 a.m.

On her way out of the party, Ms. Dorn said goodbye to Mr. Weinstein. As she turned her back to him, he grabbed between her legs, touching her buttocks and crotch through her clothes.

“I was so naïve, I didn’t say anything. And he didn’t say anything either,” she said. “I just got out of the party as fast as possible.”

Ms. Dorn said she never heard from Mr. Weinstein and never spoke to him again. Ms. Dorn said that when she told friends what had happened, many seemed to shrug it off as if it were a “rite of passage,” an acknowledgment of how “awful” the entertainment business could be.",New Accusers Expand Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Claims Back to ’70s,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-allegations.html

Belgium is virtually the only national government in Europe that has been even remotely sympathetic to Mr. Puigdemont’s pleas for mediation, not least perhaps because the country has faced separatist tensions of its own led by Flemish hard-liners.

Awkwardly, Brussels is also the headquarters of a European Union bureaucracy that has held the Catalan secessionists at arms’ length, for fear of upsetting Spain, one of the bloc’s largest member states, and stoking forces of fragmentation in other parts of the Continent.

On Monday, while there was no official confirmation that Mr. Puigdemont had gone to Brussels, the Belgian and Spanish news media variously suggested that he had arrived for consultations, to seek political asylum, or to even declare a Catalan “government in exile.”

The speculation kicked into high gear not long after Spain’s attorney general, José Manuel Maza, called around noon in Madrid for the prosecution of Mr. Puigdemont and another 19 Catalan politicians, stopping short of ordering their immediate arrest.

Mr. Maza said he wanted them Catalan politicians to appear “urgently” in court in Madrid. A decision would be left to Spanish judges whether to charge or jail them. The politicians could face 30 years in prison for the most serious of the potential charges, which included rebellion and sedition.

Officially, the Belgian government said they had no knowledge of Mr. Puigdemont’s presence in their country.

But the statements of some officials seemed to hint at an openness to accepting Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan officials if they chose exile.

“It is not unrealistic, if you see the situation at this moment, and the repression from Madrid and the prison sentences with which they are threatening, that the question is whether such a person still has a chance to a fair trial of course,” Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, told VTM News, a Belgian television station, over the weekend.

“That’s where we enter into a difficult diplomatic situation with the Spanish government,” he added.

Mr. Francken is a member of the New Flemish Alliance party, which favors Flemish independence from the rest of Belgium and has historically had strong links to the Catalan separatists as a kindred movement. Earlier this month, members of the alliance hung the Catalan independence flag — the Estelada —in the Belgian Parliament, in a gesture of support.

But Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel, has dismissed the possibility of granting asylum to Mr. Puigdemont, saying it “is absolutely not on the agenda” and called on Mr. Francken “not to fan the flames.”

Mr. Puigdemont’s arrival presents a direct challenge to Mr. Michel, a Federalist, who as the leader of a delicate government coalition, will have to keep separatists in his own government in check while trying to maintain good diplomatic relations with Spain.

Spanish media had reported that Mr. Puigdemont had left Catalonia with five other deposed members of his cabinet, by car to the southern French city of Marseille, and then by plane to Brussels.

Officials from Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s conservative Popular Party said their priority on Monday was to make sure Mr. Puigdemont did not try to stay in office, by insisting he remained leader of Catalonia, rather than worry about him escaping the country.

Fernando Martínez-Maíllo, a senior Popular Party official, characterized Mr. Puigdemont’s departure as “a desperate act.”

Albert Rivera, the leader of the Ciudadanos party, which is strongly opposed to secession, accused Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist leadership of “fleeing the country” while leaving his Catalan civil servants to resist and continue to break Spanish law.

Indeed, the forcible steps by the central government have now left Catalan civil servants and politicians with the painful choice of sticking to their secessionist plans and defying Madrid’s direct administration or facing the potential of criminal charges.

Not least, there was the important decision for separatist parties about whether to take part in regional elections called by Madrid or to risk sidelining themselves.

The two main Catalan parties — including Mr. Puigdemont’s Catalan European Democratic Party — said on Monday they would run in the elections, which are scheduled for Dec. 21, although perhaps no longer as part of the coalition that won the most parliamentary seats in 2015.

Germà Bel, a separatist Catalan lawmaker, said Mr. Puigdemont’s possible hopes of running a government from exile was “symbolic.”

“I don’t know of anyone who’s run a government from overseas,” he said. “Even Charles de Gaulle didn’t run a government from overseas.”

But he argued that it would be hard for Mr. Rajoy’s government to maintain control over Catalonia for an extended period.

The decision by pro-independence parties to take part in the December elections meant that they “at least implicitly” accept they are still part of Spain — no small concession.

“This election has been called by the Spanish government under Spanish law — and it will be an election run within the state,” Mr. Bel said.

With the emergency measures taken over the weekend, Mr. Rajoy opted not to appoint a caretaker leader of Catalonia.

Instead, the country’s deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, took over the management of the Catalan administration from Madrid, and dispatched a senior central government official to Barcelona on Monday.

Juan Ignacio Zoido, the Spanish interior minister, said on Monday that the takeover of the Catalan police force, known as the Mossos, had gone smoothly. He fired the Mossos police chief, Josep Lluís Trapero, over the weekend and appointed the deputy leader of the force, Ferran López, to the post.

Under the emergency measures allowed by Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the provision invoked by Mr. Rajoy to take control of Catalonia, the national government could replace the 17,000 officers of the Mossos with Spanish police officers.

But Mr. Zoido said that “at no point did we consider eliminating the Mossos police corps.”

Mr. Zoido called on separatist leaders to remove their personal belongings from their offices on Monday and to leave, focusing solely on preparing for the December elections, as candidates.

At least one member of Mr. Puigdemont’s ousted cabinet, Josep Rull, defiantly went to work Monday morning, after the region’s president sent a message over the weekend urging Catalans to peacefully oppose Madrid’s takeover and the removal of a democratically elected regional government.

After spending one hour in his office, Mr. Rull, the Catalan minister for planning and sustainability, left in a waiting car, but without his police detail, telling reporters that he had not removed his belongings from his office.

“Today I came to my office to carry out the work that the Catalan people entrusted to us,” he said. “And now I will continue, normally, with my agenda.”

The possibility that separatist leaders might be charged with rebellion has prompted a major dispute among Spanish lawyers.

Did the smog smother the murders or did the murders obscure the smog? That’s the terrible question Kate Winkler Dawson raises in DEATH IN THE AIR: The True Story of a Serial Killer, the Great London Smog, and the Strangling of a City (Hachette, $27), her deeply researched and densely atmospheric study of two intersecting events in London, the murder spree of John Reginald (Reg) Christie and the Great Smog of 1952.

It was bitter cold that December, prompting the city’s eight million residents to pile on the coal briquettes and draw close to the fire. At the time, Britain was selling its best black coal to foreign countries and palming off the dirty brown stuff on its own people, who couldn’t afford the better coal anyway. But this cheaper means of heating proved deadly, asphyxiating 4,000 Londoners and leaving thousands more gasping. The death toll was so high that undertakers ran out of coffins. Shifting weather patterns contributed to the disaster, trapping pollutants over the city, grounding planes and suspending traffic. Theaters, hotels and restaurants operated on reduced staff when workers were unable to report; in any case, few of their patrons were willing or able to venture out. Day after day, the “peasouper” hung in the air and the roaring fires burned in the city’s hearths. “Swirls of fog,” Dawson explains, “were romantic and beguiling to Londoners.” And the “affinity for an open fire was virtually a requirement for being British.”

Meanwhile, the fog rolling over 10 Rillington Place proved a satanic blessing, smothering the little garden where Reg Christie was industriously planting the bodies of the eight women he’d killed. (Ironically, he’d enticed some of them into his flat with the promise of a special cough medicine that would clear their smog-filled lungs.) This diligent gardener wasn’t entirely secretive about what he was up to, even using a human thighbone to prop up the garden fence. “ ‘Neighbors watched me digging,’ he said. ‘They nodded ‘cheerios’ to me.’ ” Until he was brought to trial the following year, the infamous “Beast of Rillington Place” may have been the only person in London to delight in the Great Fog.

Any book with “Belle Époque” in the title puts me in mind of Woody Allen’s enchanting fantasy film, “Midnight in Paris,” in which Pablo Picasso’s mistress and her present-day American lover travel back in time to the glorious era when Paris was the playground of great artists like Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Degas. John Merriman’s BALLAD OF THE ANARCHIST BANDITS: The Crime Spree That Gripped Belle Époque Paris (Nation Books, $28) tells another story of that era — not the romance of the “Ville Lumière” with its dazzling palaces and grand hotels but the dark tale of a city in the grip of a crime wave. “The guidebooks never mentioned the quartiers populaires,” Merriman notes, “or the impoverished suburbs of Paris, where most of the workers who ran the trams, built the popular new cars and cleaned the city lived.” It took the anarchists to argue, often violently, that working people were suffering from “increased mechanization, the decline of apprenticeship, the increase in piece rates, speedups and the beginnings of scientific management in large factories.”

Merriman’s subject is the rise and fall of the Bonnot Gang, but he shrewdly wraps his historical analysis in the arms of a love story. Rirette Maîtrejean and Victor Kibaltchiche met on the battlements of the class war, which fueled their affair and gave it purpose. But Jules Bonnot, the leader of their gang, was more committed to plunder than to the cause. “Our blood pays for the luxury of the wealthy” went the anarchist battle cry. “Our enemy is the master. Long live anarchy!” Yet Bonnot just wanted to get his hands on that upper-class loot.

Some true-crime books aren’t the least bit romantic, and they’re usually the ones that break your heart. Dashka Slater wrote THE 57 BUS (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $17.99) for teenagers, but her audience should also include parents. The two youngsters from Oakland, Calif., whose paths cross so disastrously are both extremely likable. Sasha, a boy who attends a small private school and “identifies as agender,” is on the bus going home when Richard, a junior at the public high school who’s goofing off, puts a lighter to the gauzy skirt Sasha’s wearing. The skirt goes up in flames, Sasha receives second- and third-degree burns, and Richard is accused of two hate-crime felonies. Charged as an adult, he faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.

Slater, who wrote a shorter account of this story that ran in The New York Times Magazine, views these bare facts from a firm sociological perspective. Sasha comes from a nice neighborhood up in the hills. Richard lives in the flatlands of East Oakland, where two-thirds of the city’s murders occur. “The schools are shabbier here; the test scores are lower. There’s more trash on the streets, more roaming dogs, more liquor stores, fewer grocery stores.” Slater doesn’t apologize for Richard; she just asks us to consider where he came from and to question the ingrained prejudice of a legal system that eventually locked him up for five years. Even Sasha’s father recognized that what Richard did was “impulsive, immature and unpremeditated.”

Michael Arntfield makes the most of the local crimes he covers in MAD CITY: The True Story of the Campus Murders That America Forgot (Little A, $24.95) by hitching them to some of Wisconsin’s more flamboyant murder cases. Regional pride was excuse enough to bring up notables like the “Plainfield Ghoul,” Ed Gein (“a serial killer and body snatcher whose crimes inspired the Robert Bloch novel and subsequent Alfred Hitchcock film, ‘Psycho,’ as well as the comparatively down-market ‘Texas Chainsaw Massacre’ franchise that followed”), and the “Milwaukee Cannibal” Jeffrey Dahmer. Not to mention the “Vampire of Düsseldorf,” an infamous German murderer whose mummified head came ashore in the baggage of a returning World War II soldier. (It continues to be the prize attraction in a little museum in the tourist town of Wisconsin Dells.)

Arntfield presents his murder case as “perhaps the greatest story never told in American history, at least the history of American crime.” Like his literary style, that claim is overblown. But the story of Christine Rothschild and Linda Tomaszewski still deserves to be told. In 1967, the girls met and became friends at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The late ’60s were a time when protest marches were replacing pep rallies and coeds no longer wanted to be called coeds. Christine had a room on the ground floor of Ann Emery Hall, a genteel women’s residence with “no controlled entry, no intercom, no cameras or convex mirrors, and no sign-in book.” She was unaware that a stalker was paying her nightly visits (by way of her window) until he stepped up his twisted courtship with creepy phone calls.

Once she’d identified her stalker as 42-year-old Niels Bjorn Jorgensen, a third-year medical school resident, Christine told the campus police, whose advice was simply to stay alert and buy a rape whistle. Luckily, she’d also confided in Linda. Christine wound up beaten and stabbed to death, and her friend was the only person with the grit to pursue Jorgensen — across the country, for 40 years! As a grim reminder of what he’d done, for many of those years Linda also sent him a card on Valentine’s Day.

I am a man. Six-foot-two, 200 lbs. Able-bodied, and physically fit. I move through the world with the privilege of never even considering the idea of being sexually assaulted or harassed. (Men are also sexually assaulted and raped, but the scale of those occurrences is dwarfed by scale of those problems for women.)

This is one of my male privileges, and I have to check it.

More important, I must follow the advice on sexism that I proffer on racism: If you are not actively working to dismantle it, you are supporting it. It is not sufficient to simply not be a sexist yourself if you are a man. You must also recognize that you benefit from the system of sexism in ways to which you may not even be aware.

Every man must become a feminist. Every man must work as hard as every woman to elevate gender equality and to eliminate gendered violence.

And yes, I understand how hard this can be. Constant outrage is exhausting, even about your own oppression. I am a black man in America. I’m worn threadbare dealing with the oppressions that men who look like me endure, from racially skewed mass incarceration to being the targets of police violence.

I understand that all oppressions are, in some way, intersectional and connected to all other violence, that the empathic connections of ally-ship are multidirectional and reciprocal.

And yet, it remains a stubborn fact that it is hard to stay fully immersed in another person’s pain. No matter how many times you hear them talk about their struggle, and even when you feel deeply moved by their expression of it, unless you have experienced that same pain yourself, a gap remains.

This is a very human limitation, even for the egalitarian and well intentioned. Keeping someone else’s struggle and strife top of mind is hard to do.

But acknowledging this deficiency — to yourself and to others — is a healthy and helpful first step. There is no magical solution here for the infinite and permanent expansion of empathy and awareness. It is work: hard work.

We have to stop, listen and receive other people’s experiences, validate those experiences and honor the feeling with which they are expressed. And we have to center the speaker and not the listener, center the person who lacks the privilege and not the one who possesses it.

I can’t know what women experience in this country and indeed in this world — not on a gut level or an experiential level — but I can learn the facts of those experiences. I can be eager to listen. I can advocate for cultural and policy changes that would make women’s lives better. And, I can forgive myself, I believe, for being shocked and saddened when something that I deeply understand intellectually is illustrated in ways that make me deeply understand it emotionally.

When I was in college, there was a popular T-shirt that read, “It’s a black thing, you wouldn’t understand.” I never bought one because I disagreed. Others may not be able to fully know your plight as a lived experience, but they can absolutely be made to understand, particularly if they have an earnest desire to do so.

It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted.

At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers.

On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans.

Health care sabotage.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts.

In the first of two tweets, Mr. Trump wrote: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”

In a second tweet minutes later, Mr. Trump added: “....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”

He made no comment on the guilty plea by Mr. Papadopoulous, who admitted lying to the F.B.I. about his efforts to connect Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russian government officials.

At her briefing, Ms. Sanders repeatedly insisted that Mr. Papadopolous was just “a volunteer” in the president’s campaign, and she downplayed his role by saying that he was “a volunteer member of an advisory council that literally met one time.”

Ms. Sanders insisted that Trump campaign officials rebuffed all of his efforts to put them in touch with Russians. “You mean the outreach that was repeatedly denied, and pushed away?” she said. “He reached out and nothing happened beyond that.”

His guilty plea, she said, was unrelated to his campaign efforts. “It has nothing to do with the activities of the campaign,” Ms. Sanders said. “It has to do with his failure to tell the truth that doesn’t have anything to do with the campaign or the campaign’s activities.”

Democrats jumped on the indictments, showing no hesitation to link the allegations against Trump campaign aides to Mr. Trump himself.

“We know today that the Trump presidential campaign was run by a Russian foreign agent now charged with conspiring against the United States,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. “This indictment is a sober, shattering moment and a major step toward answers and accountability for the American people. The President now owes the American people a serious explanation of his decision to hire Manafort and his own knowledge of this conspiracy.”

Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, keyed in Mr. Papadopoulis, who “pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. investigators about his contacts with a Russian individual with ‘substantial connections’ with Russian government officials who discussed possessing ‘dirt’ on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.”

“These indictments and guilty plea demonstrate beyond any doubt that this is a consequential investigation, and it must be allowed to move forward without political interference,” he said in a statement.

Ms. Sanders said that Mr. Manafort and the president have not spoken in months. She said that Mr. Gates had been at the White House several times since the inauguration, but she declined to say for certain whether Mr. Trump had spoken to Mr. Gates.

“I know that there was some initial contact after the president was sworn in,” she said, but said that she was not certain there was anything “directly with the president.”

Both Ms. Sanders and Mr. Sekulow disputed suggestions that Mr. Trump might seek to fire Mr. Mueller. “There’s no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel,” Ms. Sanders said.

The two also played down the possibility that Mr. Trump might pardon Mr. Manafort or others caught in the special counsel’s investigation. “I haven’t had a conversation with the president about pardons or pardoning individuals,” said Mr. Sekulow. Ms. Sanders likewise said that she had not spoken with the president about the possibility of pardons.

The president’s team again pointed to the Democrats to argue that they were the ones who were collaborating with Russia because of a salacious dossier of allegations against Mr. Trump produced by a firm called Fusion GPS that was paid in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

“The real collusion scandal as we’ve said several times before has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia,” Ms. Sanders said. “There’s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence the election.”",White House Says Charges Against Campaign Advisers Do Not Touch Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/trump-reaction-manafort-indictment.html

Adults in Halloween Costumes These costumed New Yorkers — or are they? — got a jump on the action this weekend.

Halloween, like adolescence and the electioneering season, gets longer each year. It also appears to get older. It is now totally common in big cities to see absolutely adult-size people roaming about in costume at any hour within a two-week period. Is that a vampire on the subway, or is it your accountant?

In New York City, it’s a bit jarring for the first two days. Then it becomes real tiresome. Then, as we hit costume saturation right before Halloween itself, it’s totally hilarious and wonderful. You’re all great!

What’s it all about that many fully grown people are pleased to wander public transport in adult diapers, clutching our boxes of Scooby Snacks? Are we a town of shameless exhibitionists, or permanent adolescents? Is New York a college campus, or a community of really inventive artists? Maybe it’s all of these things.

Every costume offers an opportunity for conversation. We hope you all met each other and went home safely.

On my last night on the job, I drank on the line, like most everyone else. Everything from there is unclear, because — from what I was able to gather — one of the cooks had drugged my drink. Apparently, a crew of colleagues, all but one of them men, took me to a house to “party” after work. I’ve been told that the man who drugged me tried to take me home with him, but the other woman who’d come along prevented this. I got into a bed, and some other guy decided to do what he liked with me.

I do not remember this. I reported the assault to the police, but could never bring myself to ask for specifics. The handprint-shaped bruise I had on my thigh gave me enough to think about.

For a long time, I couldn’t believe I had been so stupid. How could I have missed that I was in a dangerous place?

Here’s how: I bought into the idea that talk in the kitchen was just talk, and that a thick skin would indeed protect me. But it wasn’t and it didn’t, because a sexualized workplace is a dangerous workplace for women. When the entire culture of a place is lewd, it makes it impossible to tell which men are dangerous. The raunchiest man in the kitchen had no part in the assault, but a quieter cook apparently did. In the din of dirty kitchen-speak, I could not have told you the difference between them.

The urgency of this problem was harder to see a generation ago, when kitchens were relatively marginal workplaces. That is no longer the case. Today restaurants are central to our culture and our economy. As the cult of celebrity chefs has grown, annual restaurant sales have more than doubled since 2001 to just under $800 billion. The National Restaurant Association says its industry employs nearly one-tenth of all workers. Last year, restaurant jobs exceeded 9.1 million, more than half held by women. This makes restaurants mainstream, professional workplaces, and that is true for both a social media manager for the Besh restaurants, or a teenage server at an IHOP.

Whatever degree of glamour in a particular job, harassment in restaurants is nearly universal. Two-thirds of female restaurant workers reported experiencing sexual harassment from management in a 2014 survey, and 80 percent reported it from co-workers, according to research from advocacy group Restaurant Opportunities Center United. The most common type reported was the kind of sexual teasing and jokes that had preceded my assault. Most women responded the same way I did: They ignored it.

Women ignore such behavior out of self-preservation, but men ignore it because it is easy and acceptable to do so. It sounds as if that was the strategy for Mr. Bourdain, who gave an interview to Slate last week. Around bro culture, he said, “I was so uncomfortable.” But when it came to being the bad boy, he also “played that role and went along with it.” So have most male chefs and food writers.

Generally, these nonalcoholic drinks are less pricey than regular cocktails. At the American Bar, for example, prices for alcoholic cocktails start at £18 (about $24) each the nonalcoholic ones are £11.50. At Bemelmans, the difference is even more stark: nonalcoholic options are $12, compared with $21 to $26 for cocktails.

Mr. Lorincz and several other hotel bartenders said that Seedlip, a relatively new London-based brand, has inspired them to pay more attention to their virgin cocktails because the two variations of the spirit are made with flavorful, high-quality ingredients and match the sophistication of a top-shelf liquor.

In addition to Dandelyan and the American Bar, Seedlip cocktails are available at almost 100 notable hotel bars, including the Rivoli Bar at the Ritz London, the Nomad Bar at the Nomad Hotel in New York, Le Bar at Four Seasons Hotel George V in Paris and the Walker Inn at the Hotel Normandie in Los Angeles.

Seedlip’s founder, Ben Branson, said that he created the spirits because he doesn’t imbibe but likes spending time in vibrant bars. “I love the bar scene, and I often had a hard time finding a drink to enjoy at many of the bars I went to,” he said.

Well-made nonalcoholic cocktails impart the same feeling of relaxation as ones with alcohol, said Philip Duff, the education director for the New Orleans festival Tales of the Cocktail. “An artistic drink is an artistic drink whether it has alcohol in it or not, and both will chill you out,” he said. Hotel bars are the ideal setting for serving virgin drinks, he said, because compared with other bars, they tend to have bigger spending budgets and access to more ingredients, which the bartenders can use to craft creative drinks.

In addition to an expansive list of alcoholic cocktails, the Le Bar du Plaza Athenne, at the Plaza Athénée in Paris, has a “Nice Guys” no-alcohol menu with four choices, including the Mister Ginger, a combination of fresh mint, ginger ale, simple syrup and soda water.

And in New York City, Bemelmans Bar, at the Carlyle, has a seasonal nonalcoholic cocktail menu. Currently on offer is the Ananas Cooler, made of pineapple juice, ginger beer, muddled mint and agave nectar. Served over ice in a tall beer glass and garnished with candied ginger, the drink is now a best-seller at Bemelmans, according to Javier Martinez, the bar’s manager.

Nasty withdrawal symptoms make stopping doubly hard. She spent four and a half months in a New Jersey rehabilitation center before joining the Haven, first as a resident, now as a frequent visitor. She has been clean for a year and a half.

The opioid epidemic has ravaged communities around the nation — deaths from overdoses now outnumber deaths from car crashes — prompting President Trump to establish a federal task force and, on Thursday, to declare a public health emergency, allowing some grant money to be released to combat the problem and some laws and regulations to be eased. The task force is to issue a plan of action this week.

Already on campuses, recovery programs are expanding and multiplying, populated by students who have struggled with dependence on Percocet (oxycodone) and Vicodin (hydrocodone), as well as those who have moved on to fentanyl and heroin, which are far cheaper on the street than prescription pills.

Little data exist on the extent of the problem among college students. But according to a 2016 national survey of them by the University of Michigan, 7 percent of 870 respondents said they had misused opioid painkillers; 4 percent had done so in the previous year. For 19- to 22-year-olds who hadn’t gone to college or had dropped out, which is common when struggling with addiction, close to 13 percent said they had misused painkillers.

Sean Esteban McCabe, a Michigan researcher who has studied student addiction for close to 20 years, said misuse is most prevalent on competitive campuses, where students are more affluent and have better access to prescribed pills. Studies have indicated that athletes in high-contact sports like ice hockey and wrestling, who are often prescribed painkillers, are particularly vulnerable. Campus users, Dr. McCabe said, tend to be white, live in fraternity or sorority houses, and have lower grade-point averages.

Thanks to better prevention education and treatment, heroin use among college students has flattened out, and abuse of painkillers seems to be dropping. A decade ago, 9 percent in the Michigan survey said they had misused within the previous year.

This news has not heartened advocates, though, largely because the number of deaths has actually risen. Public health officials blame a black market flooded with more dangerous options like fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic that is 100 times more potent than morphine. It is the opioid that killed Prince.

Opioid-related deaths among Americans age 24 and under almost doubled from 2005 to 2015, when 3,165 were reported, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of opioid-related emergency room visits by young people also nearly doubled over five years, from 52 per 100,000 patients to 97 in 2014, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

Last May, four students at Johns Hopkins University were hospitalized after overdosing on opioids during a late-night fraternity party. Furman University in Greenville, S.C., lost a student a day before his graduation last spring when he overdosed on fentanyl. A sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who had just spent the weekend with his mother at a Tar Heel football game, was found dead in his bedroom. In his system were traces of the opioids he had tried desperately to kick.

States have urged colleges to take action. New York and Colorado are earmarking millions of dollars to their public colleges for prevention education and research. Maryland now requires colleges and universities to offer arriving students a drug-prevention class that focuses on the risks of opioid use. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who heads the federal addiction task force, announced this year a $1 million increase for recovery dorms on public campuses in his state.

It is not uncommon for stores near campuses, health centers and dorms to stock free overdose reversal kits of naloxone. And the return to school now includes a bustle of overdose-prevention training sessions for residence hall assistants, campus police officers and health care workers.

Last year, West Virginia University, in a state that leads the nation in fatal drug overdoses, started a parent support group. Mothers and fathers of young users gather monthly, some calling in remotely, to tell stories of spoons going missing from kitchen cutlery drawers and students calling home, desperate for money, dropping out of classes or getting arrested. Sometimes the parents cry uncontrollably.

Prescription pills are part of the party mix. Xanax, a highly addictive anxiety drug, has become a popular accompaniment to beer and vodka shots. Adderall is crushed for snorting. And Vicodin is ingested as a relaxant, available from students with prescriptions or on an online black market.

Dr. Joseph Lee, medical director for youth services at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, says that students act as mixologists, creating dangerous drug and alcohol cocktails for themselves and friends. “They are alarmingly familiar with what they can do to get high, but not the danger,” he said, “and they don’t know where to get help.”

Students in recovery confirm this. Many of them say that in high school and college they were purposeful about their drug use, smoking pot to calm down and taking stimulants to speed up. The technique worked well, until overuse and mixed use began to alter the impact. Drugs that were supposed to do one thing did another.

Bart Arconti, a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, got hooked on prescription painkillers in the basement of his best friend’s townhouse in a Baltimore suburb. He was 17. His friend had bought hydrocodone from a neighbor. They crushed a pill on the washing machine lid and snorted it. It became his favorite high.

Mr. Arconti hopes his story might inspire others to get help. He stopped taking opioids four and a half years ago after several stints in rehabilitation. He says users destined to become addicts generally experiment until they find the drug they want. “There is a lot to choose from,” he said.

It should not be a surprise that today’s 20-somethings have developed a taste for prescription pill cocktails. Pills are ubiquitous in homes, schools and offices. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2015 found that 119 million Americans, 12 and older, take prescription painkillers, tranquilizers, sedatives or, increasingly among children and young adults, stimulants like Adderall. That’s nearly half the population.

Painkillers in particular have surged. The sale of opioids quadrupled between 1999 and 2010, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. By 2012, doctors were writing 259 million opioid prescriptions a year, enough for every American adult to have his or her own bottle. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has been encouraging doctors to reduce the number of addictive pills they hand out. Parents are being told to dispose of unused painkillers, and drug companies are producing opioids in gel forms, so they can’t be crushed to snort.

Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the co-director of Opioid Policy Research at Brandeis University’s Heller School for Social Policy and Management, describes the drug surge as “a pill-for-everything culture,” which he says has significantly affected how young people feel about prescription pills when they go off to college. Multiple studies have shown that the more available pills are to young people, the more likely they are to use them.

“Today, if you grow up in a home where pills are used for every little problem,” he said, “you are likely to leave for college with a lot less fear about them.”

Throughout October, a wall of painted sneakers has greeted visitors to the University of North Carolina’s student union. It’s part of an exhibit entitled “Step Into the Soles of Recovery,” sponsored by the university’s four-year-old recovery program. Alongside the shoes are the personal accounts of the students who decorated them. The laces of one sneaker are wrapped tightly around it. On a piece of paper nearby, the student wrote: “For me, addiction always felt suffocating.”

Frank Allison used heroin and drank heavily until he was 40; now 51, he heads the U.N.C. recovery program. He said the exhibit was a way for some of the four-dozen students in his program to talk candidly with the campus about their struggles, part of a push to destigmatize addiction and shift attitudes about treatment.

Mr. Allison wants to see a move away from a “moral model” that treats students with substance issues like failures with no self-control instead of like people with a chronic illness, which is how the American Society of Addiction Medicine defines it. Physicians believe that this viewpoint will help frame the opioid problem for parents and educators, and help funnel recovery and prevention funds onto campuses.

U.N.C. offers a cadre of services that largely depend on where students are in their recovery — six months substance-free or 60 months substance-free. Two years ago, Mr. Allison persuaded administrators to offer beds on a drug- and alcohol-free dorm floor. Three of his students currently live there. Some choose to be closely monitored, through breathalyzers and urine tests. The university helps them find therapists and coaches who accompany them to multiple recovery meetings a week. Others have chosen more autonomy but attend Mr. Allison’s workshops on meditation, mindfulness and balanced living.

Like others in the movement, he refers to addiction as a “substance use disorder” and refuses to use the word “failure” when referring to relapses.

“People don’t misuse substances because they are bad people,” he said. “I wasn’t a bad person. I was a sick person. Having a substance use disorder is like having diabetes or a heart condition.”

Mr. Arconti, now 26 and pursuing a degree in Asian studies, says that Mr. Allison’s vision is reflected in the recovery community. The group, mostly male, consists of former frat boys, rock climbers and hip-hop fans, many not yet of legal drinking age. While some arrived in the program after too much dorm-room pot smoking, Mr. Arconti’s addiction lasted years. At the height of it, he made frequent “runs” to a drug-infested neighborhood in West Baltimore. Some of his friends have since died. Others are in jail. That was before he woke up one morning in a seedy hotel room and decided his body was spent. He committed to stopping.

When there are U.N.C. basketball games Mr. Arconti watches with his recovery friends. Together, they go to Durham Bulls games and amusement parks. But it is at weekly meetings where the recovery ethos shines. Students talk about sober dating, relapse temptations and struggles to make time for studying and recovery. When they speak specifically about their addictions, they are quick to play down the drugs they gravitated toward. Instead, they focus on the illness they share, and the future.

During a recent meeting, when it was his turn to talk, Mr. Arconti said: “I’m happy to be here. I’m mentally and spiritually feeling well.”

Nationally, more students are seeking treatment. Last year, about one in two patients at the Minnesota youth treatment center of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation were being treated for opioid addiction. In 2010, one in six were. And the number of opioid-related claims for coverage by Blue Cross Blue Shield has almost doubled since 2010 for college-age patients.

The Haven at Drexel is part of a network called the Haven at College, which started in 2012 with one residence, at the University of Southern California, where young people could bond over a common struggle. Now there are five — four on or near California campuses and the one at Drexel — housing more than 50 young adults.

The umbrella organization is run by two former users — alcohol and heroin were their drugs of choice. The cost is $1,900 to $3,800 a month, which can be defrayed by financial aid, alumni funds earmarked for recovery and Haven work-study. Students who live in the houses receive meals, coaching from a licensed clinician and support from a house manager who monitors their whereabouts. There are curfews for newcomers, penalties for missing them and chores for everyone.

But mostly, students say, there is camaraderie.

Most of the houses are near dorms or fraternity houses, in what Holly Sherman, a founder and the executive director, calls the “war zone of party central.” Still, or perhaps because of this, it is not uncommon to have dozens of people show up for the Saturday night meeting.

Ms. Sherman says students arrive on campus and wonder: “‘How am I going to stay sober if I can’t find a sober community?’ What we do is work with the university to establish that community for them.”

Matthew, a 24-year-old former varsity athlete, sometimes attends the meetings. A May graduate of Albright College in Reading, Pa., he asked that his last name not be used because he wants to work as a financial adviser or analyst at a Fortune 500 company. But the opioid obsession he developed in college is getting in the way. He hopes the experiences of other students, many of whom know well the allure of opioids but have managed to kick the habit, will rub off on him.

He was handed a “Perc” freshman year by an older teammate he looked up to. At the time, he was at a small Catholic college in a Philadelphia suburb. “I’m in college,” he recalled thinking. “Let’s experiment, let’s party. He’s cool. I want to be cool.”

Soon after, a dealer introduced him to heroin. He began snorting before class, while doing homework and instead of going to parties and drinking. The heroin made all the drudgeries — homework, dining hall food, boring classes — seem manageable. “During Accounting 101, I’m in the bathroom snorting heroin, thinking: ‘I’ve got to get back to class.’”

When he transferred to Albright College, he dialed back on the heroin and returned to Percocet. Last summer, shortly after graduating, he went to a rehabilitation center in Florida.

“I’m not ready to just throw my life away for a stupid blue pill,” he said, perched on a weathered coach in the recovery center living room. Still, he acknowledged, he struggles to kick the habit. “I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life.

But it was the Astros who had the last word in the 10th inning, and while their clubhouse was a mixture of exhaustion and elation afterward, the Dodgers were resolute.

“This is not going to be finished on Tuesday,” said Los Angeles outfielder Yasiel Puig. “There is going to be a Game 7.”

In a World Series that has come to be defined by the unpredictable and unexpected, it was only fitting that one night, after a lights-out pitchers’ duel between the heretofore unremarkable Alex Wood and Charlie Morton, a slugfest would unfold that sent the Cy Young Award winners Clayton Kershaw and Dallas Keuchel to early exits.

And Puig’s two-run homer off Chris Devenski in the ninth inning, which brought the Dodgers within 12-11, was the 22nd of the Series, breaking the previous record, set in 2002 by the San Francisco Giants and the Anaheim Angels over seven games.

“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve said this is the craziest game of my life,” said Musgrove, who blanked the Dodgers in the 10th inning to get the win. “I mean, again, tonight, this is the craziest game of my life.”

In this series, the Astros have shown not only lockdown starting pitching, dynamic defense and the type of prodigious power that invites bat flips. They have also flaunted the resilience of a champion.

Twice the Astros have rallied against one of baseball’s best closers, Kenley Jansen, and twice on Sunday they rallied against the best pitcher in baseball, Kershaw, who had dominated the Astros in a 3-1 victory in Game 1.

Nobody better exemplified that bounce-back than Springer, the Astros’ center fielder.

The Dodgers had taken an 8-7 lead in the seventh when Springer made a running dive and missed Cody Bellinger’s liner, which bounced past him and allowed Enrique Hernandez to score all the way from first.

A more cautious — and prudent — play for Springer would have been to pull back and concede the base hit. But one reason the Astros are here is their superlative defense, which had rescued them moments earlier when reliever Brad Peacock threw out Justin Turner at third on Hernandez’s bunt.

But Springer atoned on the first pitch of the bottom of the seventh, hammering a fastball from Brandon Morrow far over the left-field wall.

“That’s about as low to about as high as you could probably feel,” Springer said. “I made a bad decision. I tried to make a play, but I should have stopped. But then to come out and tie it, that’s a feeling that I don’t think I can ever describe to anybody.”

Springer’s was the third home run of the game for the Astros at that point — and both of the previous two, a three-run blast by Yuli Gurriel in the fourth off Kershaw and a three-run drive by Jose Altuve in the fifth off Kenta Maeda, had also tied the score.

“This was by far the craziest game I’ve ever been a part of and will probably ever be a part of,” said Bellinger, who hit a three-run homer in the fifth off Collin McHugh that gave the Dodgers a lead.

The Astros were not done after Springer’s home run. Bregman followed him with a sharp single, and Altuve added a drive into the left-center gap, chasing Bregman home to put the Astros ahead for the first time, 9-8.

With the crowd still on its feet, Carlos Correa hit a towering fly ball to left that seemed to scrape the roof of the ballpark, the type of shot that would be a home run in an elevator shaft — or, as it turns out, in Minute Maid Park.

Left fielder Joc Pederson drifted to the wall, but the ball landed in the first row of the Crawford Boxes — the left-field seats that abut Crawford Avenue outside the ballpark. When the ball settled in the stands, Correa — who had stopped near first base — pounded his chest and pointed to his teammates in the first-base dugout as the orange-clad crowd erupted again.

In a span of six pitches, the Astros had gone from trailing by a run to seizing an 11-8 lead. Of course, with the Astros’ beleaguered bullpen, it would not be enough.

Corey Seager’s double in the eighth closed the gap to 11-9, but Peacock stranded two runners to keep the Dodgers at bay. McCann added a solo homer in the bottom of the inning to restore the three-run lead, but again it was not enough.

After Puig’s one-out homer in the ninth brought the Dodgers within one, Barnes followed with a double and advanced to third on a groundout. Taylor then delivered, lining a 2-2 changeup from Devenski up the middle.

He shook his fist as he reached first base, signaling that the Dodgers were not done. Neither, though, were the Astros.

In the 10th, McCann was hit by a pitch from Jansen, advanced to second on a walk to Springer and then was pinch-run for by Fisher, who crossed the plate to end it.

“Drama is at an all-time high,” McCann said. “You’re on every pitch, your focus is through the roof. You have to be ready for anything, thinking two, three steps ahead, constant communication. It’s more mentally exhausting than physically.”

But for a 13-year veteran playing in his first World Series, there were no complaints. A good night’s sleep and a trip to Los Angeles awaited.

Behold a child.

A slight girl all of 6, she leaves the modest family farm, where the father minds the livestock and the mother keeps a painful secret, and walks out to the main road. Off she goes to primary school, off to the Sisters of Mercy.

IRELAND Tuam Dublin GALWAY

Her auburn hair in ringlets, this child named Catherine is bound for Tuam, the ancient County Galway town whose name derives from a Latin term for “burial mound.” It is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese, a proud distinction announced by the skyscraping cathedral that for generations has loomed over factory and field.

Two miles into this long-ago Irish morning, the young girl passes through a gantlet of gray formed by high walls along the Dublin Road that seem to thwart sunshine. To her right runs the Parkmore racecourse, where hard-earned shillings are won or lost by a nose. And to her left, the mother and baby home, with glass shards embedded atop its stony enclosure.

Behind this forbidding divide, nuns keep watch over unmarried mothers and their children. Sinners and their illegitimate spawn, it is said. The fallen.

But young Catherine knows only that the children who live within seem to be a different species altogether: sallow, sickly — segregated. “Home babies,” they’re called.

The girl’s long walk ends at the Mercy school, where tardiness might earn you a smarting whack on the hand. The children from the home are always late to school — by design, it seems, to keep them from mingling with “legitimate” students. Their oversize hobnail boots beat a frantic rhythm as they hustle to their likely slap at the schoolhouse door.

A sensitive child, familiar with the sting of playground taunts, Catherine nevertheless decides to repeat a prank she saw a classmate pull on one of these children. She balls up an empty candy wrapper and presents it to a home baby as if it still contains a sweet, then watches as the little girl’s anticipation melts to sad confusion.

Everyone laughs, nearly. This moment will stay with Catherine forever.

After classes end, the home babies hurry back down the Dublin Road in two straight lines, boots tap-tap-tapping, and disappear behind those Gothic walls. Sometimes the dark wooden front door is ajar, and on her way home Catherine thrills at the chance of a stolen peek.

Beyond those glass-fanged walls lay seven acres of Irish suffering. Buried here somewhere are famine victims who succumbed to starvation and fever a century earlier, when the home was a loathed workhouse for the homeless poor.

But they are not alone.

Deep in the distant future, Catherine will expose this property’s appalling truths. She will prompt a national reckoning that will leave the people of Ireland asking themselves: Who were we? Who are we?

At the moment, though, she is only a child. She is walking home to a father tending to the cattle and a mother guarding a secret, away from the Irish town whose very name conjures the buried dead.

Ritual and Remembrance

In Ireland, the departed stay present.

You might still come across old-timers who recall how families in rural stretches would clean the house and set out a drink on the first night of November — the eve of All Souls’ Day — in the belief that the dead will return. How it was best to stay in the center of the road when walking at night, so as not to disturb the spirits resting along the wayside.

Even today, the Irish say they do death well. Local radio newscasts routinely end with a recitation of death notices. In a country where the culture of Catholicism, if not its practice, still holds sway, this alerts the community to a familiar ritual: the wake at the home, the funeral Mass, the long gathering at the pub, the memorial Mass a month later, and the anniversary Mass every year thereafter.

Wry acceptance of mortality lives in the country’s songs, literature, and wit. A standard joke is the Irish marriage proposal: “Would you like to be buried with my people?” A standard song describes a thrown bottle splattering whiskey – from the Irish for “water of life” — over a corpse. Thus the late Tim Finnegan is revived at his wake; see how he rises.

Respect for burial grounds runs deep, with crowds gathering in their local cemetery once a year to pray as a priest blesses the dead within. This reverence for the grave may derive from centuries of land dispossession, or passed-on memories of famine corpses in the fields and byways, or simply be linked to a basic desire expressed by the planting of a headstone:

To be remembered.

Some 60 years have passed since Catherine’s primary school days. It is a gloomy June afternoon, and she is walking the grounds once hidden behind those shard-studded walls. As rain falls from the crow-flecked sky, she drapes her black jacket over her head, almost like a shawl.

Her name now is Catherine Corless, née Farrell. At 63, she is a grandmother with a smile not easily given, and any fealty to Catholicism long since lost.

True, she occasionally volunteers to paint the weathered statues outside the local country churches: the blue of the Blessed Virgin’s eyes, the bronze in St. Patrick’s beard. But this is for the community, not the church. She finds deeper meaning in her garden, in the birds at the feeder outside her kitchen window, in the earth here at her feet.

Few photographs exist of the grim building that once loomed over this corner of Tuam (pronounced Chewm), perhaps because few desired the memory. In its place stand drab rows of subsidized housing and a modest playground. A silvery swing set, a yellow slide, a jungle gym.

One day, a few years back, Catherine began to inquire about the old home that had stoked her schoolgirl imagination. She set out on an amateur’s historical quest, but whenever she focused on the children who lived there, so many questions arose about the children who died there — the ones who never made it to the classroom, or even past infancy.

What, then, of Patrick Derrane, who died at five months in 1925, and Mary Carty, at five months in 1960, and all those in between, children said to have been “born on the other side of the blanket”? The Bridgets and Noras and Michaels and Johns, and so many Marys, so many Patricks, their surnames the common language of Ireland.

Would people pause at their graves? Would they be remembered?

In asking around, what Catherine heard was:

Ah, them poor children. Them poor children.

The more she dug, the more a distant time and place was revealed. Now, standing on the sodden grass, she can nearly see and hear all that was. The polished halls and bustling dormitories, the babies’ nappies and nuns’ habits, the shouts, the whimpers, the murmur of prayer.

‘Waiting for the Crucifixion’

The women and their newborns often arrived after the inquisitive streetlamps of Tuam had dimmed. They came from towns and crossroads with names like snatches of song. Portumna and Peterswell, Claremorris and Lettermore, Moylough and Loughrea.

And now they were here at the St. Mary’s Mother and Baby Home, a massive building the color of storm clouds, a way station for 50 single mothers and 125 children born out of wedlock.

The building opened in 1846 as a workhouse, but almost immediately it began receiving victims of the Great Hunger, a famine so horrific that the moans of the dying, The Tuam Herald reported, were “as familiar to our ears as the striking of the clock.” It later became a military barracks, serving the new Irish government formed after a treaty between Irish rebels and Great Britain in 1921. One spring morning during the civil war that followed, six prisoners — republicans who disagreed with concessions in the treaty — were marched into the yard and executed against the ashen wall.

The government repurposed the building to be among the institutions intended as ports of salvation where disgraced women might be redeemed. These state-financed homes were invariably managed by a Catholic order, in keeping with the hand-in-glove relationship between the dominant church and the fledgling state.

Given the misogyny, morality, and economics that informed the public debate of the time — when a pregnancy out of wedlock could threaten a family’s plans for land inheritance, and even confer dishonor upon a local pastor — imagine that naïve young woman from the country: impregnated by a man, sometimes a relative, who would assume little of the shame and none of the responsibility. She might flee to England, or pretend that the newborn was a married sister’s — or be shipped to the dreaded Tuam home, run by a religious order with French roots called the Congregation of Sisters of Bon Secours.

Their motto: “Good Help to Those in Need.”

You rose early and went down to the nursery with your infant. Mass at 8, then porridge and tea for breakfast. Breast feeding next, after which you rinsed your child’s diapers before moving on to your daily drudgery. You might polish the dormitory floors with beeswax or clean bedsheets stained with urine.

“An awful lonely ould hole,” recalled Julia Carter Devaney.

Born in a workhouse and left in the care of the Bon Secours, Julia became an employee who lived in the home for almost 40 years. Although she died in 1985, her rare insight into this insulated world — one she described as “unnatural” — lives on in taped interviews.

The gates remained unlocked to accommodate deliveries, but so powerful was the sense of cultural imprisonment that you dared not leave. Save for the chance gift of a cake from the bread man, you starved for love or consolation over the loss of your innocent courting days.

“Many a girl shed tears,” Julia said.

The Bon Secours sisters who watched your every move were doing the bidding of Irish society. They, too, existed in a repressive patriarchy with few options for women. They might have experienced a spiritual calling as a young girl, or simply desired not to be a farmer’s wife, having seen overworked mothers forever pregnant, forever fretting. A vocation offered education, safety and status, all reflected in clean, freshly pressed habits.

And Julia remembered them all.

Mother Hortense had a big heart, yet was quick to punish; Mother Martha was more enlightened, but a thump from her could “put you into the middle of next week.” This one hated the mere sight of children, while that one used kindness the way others used the rod. So it went.

The sisters frequently threatened banishment to the mental asylum in Ballinasloe, or to one of the Magdalen Laundries: institutions where women perceived to be susceptible or errant — including “second offenders” who had become pregnant again — were often sent to work, and sometimes die, in guilt-ridden servitude.

You preferred instead to suffer at the mother and baby home, bracing for that day when, after a year or so of penitent confinement, you were forced to leave — almost always without your child. Waiting for that moment of separation, Julia recalled, was “like Our Lady waiting for the Crucifixion.”

Typical is the story of one unmarried woman who had been sent to the home from a remote Galway farm. Determined to remain close to her child, she took a job as a cleaner at a nearby hospital and, for several years, she appeared at the home’s door on her day off every week to say the same thing:

That’s my son you have in there. I want my son. I want to rear him.

No, would come the answer. And the door would close.

For the children left behind, there were swings and seesaws and donated Christmas gifts from town, but no grandparents and cousins coming around to coo. They lived amid the absence of affection and the ever-present threat of infectious disease.

“Like chickens in a coop,” Julia said.

Many survivors have only the sketchiest memories of those days, a haze of bed-wetting and rocking oneself to sleep. One man, now in his 70s, remembers being taken for a walk with other home babies, and the excitement of seeing themselves in the side-view mirrors of parked cars.

“We didn’t even know it was a reflection of ourselves in the mirror,” he recalled. “And we were laughing at ourselves. Laughing.”

Until they were adopted, sent to a training school or boarded out to a family, the older children walked to one of the two primary schools along the Dublin Road, some of them calling out “daddy” and “mammy” to strangers in the street. Shabby and betraying signs of neglect, they sat at the back of the classroom, apart.

“I never remember them really being taught,” Catherine said. “They were just there.”

Teachers threatened to place rowdy students beside the home babies. Parents warned children that if they were bad they’d go right to “the home.” And even though the babies were baptized as a matter of routine, there remained the hint of sulfur about them.

“They were the children of the Devil,” recalled Kevin O’Dwyer, 67, a retired principal who grew up just yards from the home. “We learned this in school.”

Still, when a bully targeted a young Kevin during one recess, the child who came to his rescue was a home baby. You leave him alone, the older girl warned. I see you doing that to him again, I’ll get ya.

The man has never forgotten his protector’s name: Mary Curran.

One September day in 1961, a rare and ferocious hurricane howled across Ireland, downing power lines, destroying barley fields, battering cottages. As gales flicked away slates from the roof above, Julia helped lock the doors of the mother and baby home for good. Its conditions were poor, some of its staff untrained, and County Galway officials decided not to proceed with a planned renovation.

Abandoned, the massive H-block building devolved into an echoing, eerie playscape, where games of hide-and-seek unfolded in dull halls once polished with beeswax. Even the old chapel became a place where children became the priests and confessors. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I shot Brother Whatever,” Kevin recalled. “That kind of thing.”

The years passed. Galway County moved forward with plans to demolish the home and build subsidized housing. And the memories of hobnailed pitter-patter faded, replaced by the faint sounds of children outracing the home baby ghosts that inhabited the property at night.

In Pain, Finding Purpose

Catherine still wonders what led her to the story of the mother and baby home. Chance, perhaps, or distant memories of the little girl she once teased. Despite her bone-deep modesty, there are even times when she feels chosen.

She thinks back to her solitary childhood, her best friend a dog she called “Puppy,” her time spent navigating the sadness that enveloped her mother. She admired the woman’s deep empathy for others, but was puzzled by her refusal to say much about her own people back in County Armagh, a good 140 miles northeast of Tuam. Sure they’re all dead and gone, is all she’d say, and God help you if you pried much further.

“A troubled soul,” her daughter said.

Catherine graduated from secondary school, left a Galway art college for fear of lacking the necessary talent, and found satisfaction as a receptionist. In 1978, she married Aidan Corless, a man as gregarious as she was shy, a fine singer, nimble on the accordion, comfortable on the community theater stage.

Four children quickly followed. Before long, Catherine was minding the children of neighbors as well, immersing herself in the homework, play and exuberance of the young.

Her mother, Kathleen, died at 80 in 1992, leaving behind so much unsaid. Catherine eventually headed up to Armagh to examine public records that might explain why her mother had been so withholding, so unsettled.

As if part of some cosmic riddle, the answer was provided in the absence of one. On her mother’s birth certificate, in the space reserved for the name of the father: nothing.

Her mother had been conceived out of wedlock.

Other telltale strands to the woman’s early years came to be known: Fostered out, moving from family to family before finding work as a domestic. Then harboring until death a secret she found shameful enough to keep from her husband.

“That she went through her life, that she didn’t like telling us,” Catherine said. “That she was ashamed to tell us…”

In this patch of pain and regret, a seed was planted.

The revelations about her mother fueled in Catherine an interest in understanding the forces that shape who we are and how we behave. While attending a rigorous night course in local history, she learned an invaluable lesson:

“If you don’t find something, you don’t leave it. You ask why it’s not there. You use ‘why’ a lot.”

With the children grown, Catherine began contributing essays to the journal of the Old Tuam Society about local history, all the while grappling with debilitating headaches and anxiety attacks. The episodes might last for days, with the only relief at times coming from lying on the floor, still, away from light.

Burrowing deep into the past, though, provided welcome distraction, and at some point she chose to delve into the subject of the old mother and baby home: its beginnings as a workhouse, its place in Tuam history, the usual. Nothing deep.

But there were almost no extant photographs of the home, and most of the locals were reluctant to talk. Every question Catherine raised led to another, the fullness of truth never quite within reach. Why, for example, did one corner of the property feature a well-manicured grotto centered around a statue of the Blessed Virgin?

Oh that, a few neighbors said. A while back an older couple created the peaceful space to mark where two local lads once found some bones in a concrete pit. Famine victims, maybe.

The story made no sense to Catherine. The famine dead weren’t buried that way.

Who were these boys? What did they see?

Frannie Hopkins was about 9, Barry Sweeney, about 7. The two were at the fledgling stage of boyhood mischief as they monkeyed around some crab apple trees, all within view of the deserted home that figured in their fertile imagination.

Some evenings, Frannie’s father would delay his pint at the Thatch Bar, at the top of the town, until he had watched his son race down the Athenry Road, dodging ghosts from the old home to his left and the cemetery to his right, all the way to the family’s door. But on this autumn day in the early 1970s, the boys were daring in the daylight.

Jumping into some overgrowth at the property’s southwest corner, they landed on a concrete slab that echoed in answer. Curious, they pushed aside the lid to reveal a shallow, tank-like space containing a gruesome jumble of skulls and bones.

Frannie nudge-bumped Barry, and the younger lad fell in. He started to cry, as any boy would, so Frannie pulled him out and then the two boys were running away, laughing in fun or out of fright. They told everyone they met, prompting Frannie’s father to say he’d get a right kick in the arse if he went back to that spot.

County workers soon arrived to level that corner of the property. The police said they were only famine bones. A priest said a prayer. And that was that.

In adulthood, Barry Sweeney would go to England to find work, and Frannie Hopkins would travel the world as an Irish soldier. Both would return to Tuam, where their shared story would come up now and then in the pub or on the street.

People would tell them they were either mistaken or lying. Barry would become upset that anyone would doubt a story that had so affected him, but Frannie would take pains to reassure him.

Barry, he would say. The truth will out.

The Marys, Patricks and Johns

Now, 40 years later, here was Catherine Corless, amateur historian, trying to unearth that truth, applying what she had learned in her community center research class: Use “why” a lot.

When her headaches and panic attacks eased, she pored over old newspapers in a blur of microfilm. She spent hours studying historic maps in the special collections department of the library at the national university in Galway City. One day she copied a modern map of Tuam on tracing paper and placed it over a town map from 1890.

And there it was, in the cartographic details from another time: A tank for the home’s old septic system sat precisely where the two boys had made their ghastly discovery. It was part of the Victorian-era system’s warren of tunnels and chambers, all of which had been disconnected in the late 1930s.

Did this mean, then, that the two lads had stumbled upon the bones of home babies? Buried in an old sewage area?

“I couldn’t understand it,” Catherine said. “The horror of the idea.”

Acting on instinct, she purchased a random sample from the government of 200 death certificates for children who had died at the home. Then, sitting at the Tuam cemetery’s edge in the van of its caretaker, she checked those death certificates against all the burials recorded by hand in two oversize books.

Only two children from the home had been buried in the town graveyard. Both were orphans, both “legitimate.”

Neither the Bon Secours order nor the county council could explain the absence of burial records for home babies, although it was suggested that relatives had probably claimed the bodies to bury in their own family plots. Given the ostracizing stigma attached at the time to illegitimacy, Catherine found this absurd.

In December 2012, Catherine’s essay, titled “The Home,” appeared in the historical journal of Tuam. After providing a general history of the facility, it laid out the results of her research, including the missing burial records and the disused septic tank where two boys had stumbled upon some bones.

“Is it possible that a large number of those little children were buried in that little plot at the rear of the former Home?” she wrote. “And if so, why is it not acknowledged as a proper cemetery?”

She also shared her own memories, including that joke she and a classmate had played on two home babies long ago. “I thought it funny at the time how those little girls hungrily grabbed the empty sweet papers, but the memory of it now haunts me,” she wrote.

Her daring essay implicitly raised a provocative question: Had Catholic nuns, working in service of the state, buried the bodies of hundreds of children in the septic system?

Catherine braced for condemnation from government and clergy — but none came. It was as if she had written nothing at all.

There was a time when Catherine wanted only to have a plaque erected in memory of these forgotten children. But now she felt that she owed them much more. “No one cared,” she said. “And that’s my driving force all the time: No one cared.”

She kept digging, eventually paying for another spreadsheet that listed the names, ages, and death dates of all the “illegitimate” children who had died in the home during its 36-year existence.

The sobering final tally: 796.

Five-month-old Patrick Derrane was the first to die, from gastroenteritis. Weeks later, Mary Blake, less than 4 months old and anemic since birth. A month after that, 3-month-old Matthew Griffin, of meningitis. Then James Murray, fine one moment, dead the next. He was 4 weeks old.

In all, seven children died at the mother and baby home in 1925, the year it opened. The holidays were especially tough, with 11-month-old Peter Lally dying of intestinal tuberculosis on Christmas Day, and 1-year-old Julia Hynes dying the next day, St. Stephen’s Day, after a three-month bout of bronchitis.

Measles. Influenza. Gastroenteritis. Meningitis. Whooping cough. Tuberculosis. Severe undernourishment, also known as marasmus.

Nine home babies died in 1930. Eleven in 1931. Twenty-four in 1932. Thirty-two in 1933.

The Tuam home was not alone. Children born out of wedlock during this period were nearly four times more likely to die than “legitimate” children, with those in institutions at particular risk. The reasons may be many — poor prenatal care, insufficient government funding, little or no training of staff – but this is certain: It was no secret.

In 1934, the Irish parliament was informed of the inordinate number of deaths among this group of children. “One must come to the conclusion that they are not looked after with the same care and attention as that given to ordinary children,” a public health official said.

Thirty died in the Tuam home that year.

In 1938, it was 26. In 1940, 34. In 1944, 40.

In 1947, a government health inspector filed a report describing the conditions of infants in the nursery: “a miserable emaciated child…delicate…occasional fits…emaciated and delicate…fragile abscess on hip…not thriving wizened limbs emaciated…pot-bellied emaciated…a very poor baby…”

That year, 52 died.

Catherine felt obligated to these children. Continuing to plumb the depths of the past, she eventually cross-checked her spreadsheet of 796 deceased home babies with the burial records of cemeteries throughout counties Galway and Mayo. Not one match.

“They’re not in the main Tuam graveyard where they should have been put initially,” she remembers thinking. “They’re not in their mothers’ hometown graveyards. Where are they?”

Catherine, of course, already knew.

The Truth Outs, a Nation Reels

Catherine lives simply, almost monastically. She favors practical clothing, usually black, and has never been one for a night at the pub. She doesn’t drink alcohol or eat meat. Give her a bowl of muesli at the kitchen table and she’ll be grand.

Those headaches and anxiety attacks, though, remain a part of her withdrawn life. Aidan, her husband, has become accustomed to attending wakes and weddings by himself. A few years ago, he booked a Mediterranean cruise for two; he traveled alone.

“A very quiet, introverted person, wrapped up in her own thoughts,” Aidan said of his wife. “Suffering, if you like.”

But thoughts of the dead children of Tuam pushed Catherine beyond her fears. Believing that the body of even one “legitimate” baby found in a septic tank would have prompted an outcry, she suspected that the silence met by her essay spoke to a reluctance to revisit the painful past — a past that had consumed her own mother.

Now she was angry.

Adding to her fury was the knowledge that when a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours closed in 2002, the religious order disinterred the bodies of a dozen nuns and reinterred them in consecrated ground outside the nearby pilgrimage town of Knock.

“I feel it at times: that those poor little souls were crying out for recognition, a recognition they never got in their little, short lives,” Catherine said. “It was a wrong that just had to be righted some way.”

Seeing no other option, she contacted a reporter for The Irish Mail on Sunday, a national newspaper. Not long after, in the spring of 2014, a front-page story appeared about a certain seven acres in Tuam.

It became the talk of Ireland.

All who had been quiet before — the clerics, politicians and government officials — now conveyed shock and sadness, while the besieged Bon Secours sisters hired a public relations consultant whose email to a documentarian did little for the religious order’s reputation:

“If you come here, you’ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying ‘Yeah, a few bones were found — but this was an area where Famine victims were buried. So?’”

The news from Tuam had shocked many in the country, but the dismissive email reflected the lurking doubts about Catherine’s work. She was, after all, only a housewife.

Mary Moriarty was getting her light-blond hair done at a salon in Tuam one day when the beauty-parlor chatter turned to this troublemaker Catherine Corless.

The entire matter should be forgotten and put behind us, someone said.

Mary, a grandmother well known in town for her advocacy work, would have none of it.

Well, she said. Every child is entitled to their name, and their mothers could be any one of us but for the grace of God.

She left the salon, introduced herself by telephone to Catherine, and recounted a story that she rarely shared.

In 1975, Mary was a young married mother living in one of the new subsidized houses built on the old mother and baby home property. One morning, close to Halloween, a neighbor told her that a boy was running about with a skull on a stick.

The boy, Martin, said he had found his prize in the overgrown muck, and there were loads more.

What the boy mistook for a plastic toy was actually the skull of a child, with a nearly complete set of teeth. “That’s not plastic, Martin,” Mary recalled saying. “You have to put it back where you found it.”

Mary and a couple of neighbors followed the boy through the weeds and rubble, across the soft wet ground. Suddenly, the earth beneath her feet began to give, and down she fell into some cave or tunnel, with just enough light to illuminate the subterranean scene.

As far as she could see were little bundles stacked one on top of another, like packets in a grocery, each about the size of a large soda bottle and wrapped tight in graying cloth.

When her friends pulled her up, Mary’s legs were scratched and her mind was on fire. What had she seen? That very morning, she reached out to a person in town who might know. Soon a stout older woman arrived on a bicycle, her faithful dogs trotting by her side.

Julia Carter Devaney, who used to work at the home.

“Ah, yeah, that’s where the little babies is,” Mary recalled her saying as she came to a stop.

Julia bent down at the hole and peered in. Mary never forgot what the older woman said next: “Many a little one I carried out in the nighttime.”

Mary did not know what to make of this. Perhaps these were the bodies of stillborns – and therefore unbaptized. Stillborns. Yes, that’s what they must be.

Eighteen months after falling into the hole, Mary gave birth to her son Kevin at a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours sisters. After breakfast, a nun presented her with her newborn, who was swathed like a little mummy. The young mother’s mind instantly recalled those stacks of graying bundles, and straightaway she unwrapped her precious child.

Now, after listening to the woman’s tale, Catherine asked whether Mary would be willing to tell her story on national radio.

Of course.

The Dead and the Living

The veteran geophysicist guided her mower-like contraption over the thick grass, back and forth across a carefully measured grid. Equipped with ground-penetrating radar, the machine sent radio waves through the topsoil and down into the dark earth.

The curious machine was hunting for secrets concealed in the ground of the old mother and baby home, all beneath the gaze of a statue of the Blessed Virgin.

This subterranean trawling was being conducted on an early autumn day in 2015 for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, a panel created by an embarrassed government in response to Catherine’s research. Its charge: to examine a once-accepted way of Irish life in all its social and historical complexity.

The commission’s investigation into the homes — a network that by the late 1970s was falling into disuse — is focused on 18 institutions scattered across Ireland: in the capital city of Dublin, and in Counties Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kilkenny, Meath, Tipperary and Westmeath. The high infant mortality rate in some of these facilities was startling. In the Bessborough home in Cork, 478 children died from 1934 to 1953 — or about one death every two weeks.

The investigation’s broad mandate also includes scrutiny of the network’s links to the notorious Magdalen Laundries. The apparent coercion of unmarried mothers to surrender their children for adoption, often to Catholic Americans. The vaccine trials carried out on mother-and-baby-home children for pharmaceutical companies. The use of home-baby remains for anatomical study at medical colleges.

It was all part of a church-state arrangement that, decades earlier, a longtime government health inspector named Alice Litster had repeatedly denounced, mostly to silence. This system marginalized defenseless Irish women, she asserted, and turned their unfortunate offspring into “infant martyrs of convenience, respectability, and fear.”

The Tuam case incited furious condemnation of a Catholic Church already weakened by a litany of sexual abuse scandals. Others countered that the sisters of Bon Secours had essentially been subcontractors of the Irish state.

But laying the blame entirely on the church or the state seemed too simple — perhaps even too convenient. After all, many of these abandoned children had fathers and grandparents and aunts and uncles.

The bitter truth was that the mother and baby homes mirrored the Mother Ireland of the time.

As its investigation continued, the commission would occasionally provide cryptic updates of its work in Tuam. In September 2016, for example, it announced that forensic archaeologists would be digging trenches to resolve questions “in relation to the interment of human remains.”

While she waited for the commission to complete its work, the woman responsible for this national self-examination, Catherine Corless, returned in a way to those days when her children and the children of neighbors packed the house. Only now the ones gathering about her were in their 60s and 70s, with hair of silver.

Home babies.

Often lost in the uproar over the many children who died at the Tuam home were the stories of those who had survived. And once Catherine’s research became international news, they began calling and emailing her, seeing in this introverted woman their only hope of trying to find out who their mothers were, who their siblings were — who they were.

Catherine assumed the role of pro bono private detective, following paper trails that often led to some cemetery in England, where many unmarried mothers had gone to start anew. The children they were separated from, she said, needed to hear that their mother had “fared all right.”

Before long, some of these survivors were gathering at the Corless house for a cup of tea and a chat. In their habits and manners of speech, they reminded Catherine of someone close to her who also had been born out of wedlock.

“They all have a kind of low self-esteem,” she said. “They feel inadequate. They feel a bit inferior to other people. It mirrored, really, the way my mother was.”

During her research, Catherine had built a detailed, wood-and-clay model of the home, large enough to cover a dining-room table. It had helped her to visualize.

Now she and Aidan would occasionally remove the model from a high shelf in the barn out back so that survivors could do the same. They would touch the gray walls and peer into the small windows, as if to imagine themselves in the arms of their mothers.

P. J. Haverty, a retired mechanic, sat at the Corless kitchen table one day, sipping tea and eating a ham-and-butter sandwich. He was born in 1951, the son of a 27-year-old woman who had been left at the home by her father when she was eight months pregnant. Eileen was her name, and she seemed to vanish a year after giving birth.

The white-haired man remembers only a few snapshot moments of the home. Wetting the bed mattresses that would then be propped against the window to dry. Seeing himself for the first time in a car’s side-view mirror. Walking out the door with his new foster parents, the father choosing him because he looked sturdy for farm work, the mother because he had smiled at her.

P. J. was happy enough until his teens, when he was called a “bastard,” and people avoided the pew he sat in, and girls at a dance tittered at the sight of him. “If the parents found out,” he said, “they’d tell them to keep away from that lad, you don’t know where he came from.”

He considered drowning himself in the fast-moving river that coursed through his foster father’s field. “The things that I was called,” he said. “I just thought everyone was against me.”

Thanks to a hint dropped here, a secret whispered there, P. J. managed in adulthood to locate his birth mother in South London. Plump and with graying hair, she reassured him that she hadn’t abandoned him. After leaving the Tuam home, she had taken a cleaning job at a nearby hospital and, for more than five years, returned every week to demand that she be given back her child — only to be turned away at the door.

P. J.’s voice caught as he recalled what his mother, now dead, had said she told the nuns to no avail.

“That’s my son you have in there. I want to rear him. I want to look after him.”

‘Chamber of Horrors’

It was true.

In early March of this year, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission reported that “significant quantities of human remains” had been discovered on the grounds of the Tuam home.

The ground-penetrating radar and delicate excavation had revealed what appeared to be a decommissioned septic tank. And in 17 of that septic system’s 20 chambers, investigators found many human bones. A small sampling revealed that they were of children, ranging in age from 35 fetal weeks to three years, and all dating from the home’s 36 years of operation.

Expressing shock, the commission vowed to continue its investigation into “who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way.”

Once again, Ireland’s past had returned to haunt.

His voice trembling with passion, the prime minister, Enda Kenny, addressed the Irish legislature on what he called the “chamber of horrors” discovered in Tuam. In the “so-called good old days,” he said, Irish society “did not just hide away the dead bodies of tiny human beings.”

“We dug deep and we dug deeper still,” he said. “To bury our compassion, to bury our mercy, to bury our humanity itself.”

Though the prime minister said that “no nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children,” others directed their wrath at the Catholic Church and, of course, the Bon Secours order, whose only response so far has been to express its “continued cooperation and support” for the commission’s work.

The Corless household, meanwhile, became an international newsroom, with family members fielding the constant telephone calls and accommodating the television crews forever at the door. Catherine answered every question out of duty, not vanity. But when Ireland’s most popular television program, “The Late Late Show,” invited her to appear as a guest, she balked.

There was her ever-present anxiety, which now limited her driving to little more than weekly five-mile runs to the SuperValu grocery in Tuam. More than that, she feared being accused of self-aggrandizement at the expense of dead children.

With her family all but demanding that she accept — Imagine how many home-baby survivors, suffering in silence, might be reached — Catherine reluctantly consented, but only if she would already be seated when the program returned from a commercial break. She did not want to be summoned from the curtain to unwanted applause.

Aidan drove her into Galway City to buy an outfit: black pants and a black top, of course, brightened slightly with a silver trim. Then up to Dublin.

“I was a mess,” Catherine recalled. “But I said: ‘This is it. I have to do it.’”

When she finished telling the story of the Tuam home on live television, the audience rose in what the host described as a very rare standing ovation. Catherine nodded, smiled slightly, tightly, and exhaled. Watching on a monitor in an adjacent room, her husband fought back tears.

“I’m married to her for 40 years,” he said later, still astonished. “And I don’t know her at all.”

Catherine’s Final Quest

Photographs of grandchildren adorn the tan walls. A silver kettle rests on the stove. A laptop computer sits open on the counter, beside a window that looks out on a garden, a bird feeder and, beyond, an undulating field of grass.

This is the kitchen of Catherine Corless, and her office. She conducts her online research here, and keeps assorted documents on the kitchen table for easy retrieval when yet another call comes in. Can you help me find my mother, my sister, my… She never refuses.

The future of the Tuam grounds that her questioning disturbed has yet to be revealed. The government is grappling with many complexities, including the sad fact that the remains of infants and children, the Marys and Patricks, the Bridgets and Johns, are commingled.

One option is to leave everything as is. Another is to disinter the remains for possible identification and proper burial — although it is unclear whether DNA evidence can be recovered from those who died so young, and so long ago.

Other issues also need resolution. Potential compensation for home baby survivors; litigation against the Bon Secours sisters, who run a vast health-care network; the propriety of children playing above the bones of other children.

And there remains the maddening mystery of why a Catholic order of nuns would bury these children in such a manner. Was it to save a few pounds for the cost of each burial? Was it meant as a kind of catacombs, in echo of the order’s French roots?

The baptism of these children entitled them under canon law to a funeral Mass and burial in consecrated ground. But perhaps the baptismal cleansing of their “original sin” was not enough to also wipe away the shameful nature of their conception. Perhaps, having been born out of wedlock in an Ireland of another time, they simply did not matter.

Her auburn hair cut short, Catherine stands now at her computer, gazing through the window at the garden that blesses her with a sense of oneness with it all. Her begonias are blood-red bursts, her lobelias the bluest of blue, her mind forever returning to the past.

A candy wrapper. Empty.

She has searched school and government records many, many times. So far, though, she has been unable to find the name of one particular little girl from the mother and baby home, her long-ago classmate.

“It would be nice to meet her,” Catherine says, leaving no doubt as to what she would say if given the chance.",The Lost Children of Tuam,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/world/europe/tuam-ireland-babies-children.html

There are still questions hanging over this research. Most notably, because these algorithms learn by analyzing more information than any human ever could, it is sometimes difficult to audit their behavior and understand why they make particular decisions. But in the years to come, machine learning will be essential to the continued progress of autonomous vehicles.

Today’s vehicles are not nearly as autonomous as they may seem. After 10 years of research, development and testing, Google’s cars are poised to offer public rides on the streets of Arizona. Waymo, which operates under Google’s parent company, is preparing to start a taxi service near Phoenix, according to a recent report, and unlike other services, it will not put a human behind the wheel as a backup. But its cars will still be on a tight leash.

For now, if it doesn’t carry a backup driver, any autonomous vehicle will probably be limited to a small area with large streets, little precipitation, and relatively few pedestrians. And it will drive at low speeds, often waiting for extended periods before making a left-hand turn or merging into traffic without the help of a stoplight or street sign — if it doesn’t avoid these situations altogether.

At the leading companies, the belief is that these cars can eventually handle more difficult situations with help from continued development and testing, new sensors that can provide a more detailed view of the surrounding world and machine learning.

Waymo and many of its rivals have already embraced deep neural networks, complex algorithms that can learn tasks by analyzing data. By analyzing photos of pedestrians, for example, a neural network can learn to identify a pedestrian. These kinds of algorithms are also helping to identify street signs and lane markers, predict what will happen next on the road, and plan routes forward.

The trouble is that this requires enormous amounts of data collected by cameras, radar and other sensors that document real-world objects and situations. And humans must label this data, identifying pedestrians, street signs and the like. Gathering and labeling data describing every conceivable situation is an impossibility. Data on accidents, for instance, is hard to come by. This is where simulations can help.

Recently, Waymo unveiled a roadway simulator it calls Carcraft. Today, the company said, this simulator provides a way of testing its cars at a scale that is not possible in the real world. Its cars can spend far more time on virtual roads than the real thing. Presumably, like other companies, Waymo is also exploring ways that its algorithms can actually learn new behavior from this kind of simulator.

Mr. Pratt said Toyota is already using images of simulated roadways to train neural networks, and this approach has yielded promising results. In other words, the simulations are similar enough to the physical world to reliably train the systems that operate the cars.

Part of the advantage with a simulator is that researchers have complete control over it. They need not spend time and money labeling images — and potentially making mistakes with these labels. “You have ground truth,” Mr. Pratt explained. “You know where every car is. You know where every pedestrian is. You know where every bicycler is. You know the weather.”

Others are exploring a more complex method called reinforcement learning. This a major area of research inside many of the world’s top artificial intelligence labs, including DeepMind (the London-based lab owned by Google), the Berkeley AI Research Lab, and OpenAI (the San Francisco-based lab founded by Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk and others). These labs are building algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks inside virtual worlds through intensive trial and error.

DeepMind used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game Go better than any human. In essence, the machine played thousands upon thousands of Go games against itself, carefully recording which moves proved successful and which didn’t. And now, DeepMind and other leading labs are using similar techniques in building machines that can play complex video games like StarCraft.

That may seem frivolous. But if machines can navigate these virtual worlds, they can make their way through the physical world.

Inside Uber’s autonomous car operation, for example, researchers have trained systems to play the popular game Grand Theft Auto, with an eye toward applying these methods, eventually, to real world cars. Training systems in simulations of physical locations is the next step.

Bridging the gap between the virtual and the physical is no easy task, Mr. Pratt said. And companies must also ensure that algorithms don’t learn unexpected or harmful behavior while learning on their own. That is a big worry among artificial intelligence researchers.

For this and other reasons, companies like Toyota and Waymo are not building these cars solely around machine learning. They also hand-coded software in more traditional ways in an effort to guarantee certain behavior. Waymo cars don’t learn to stop at stop lights, for example. There is a hard and fast rule that they stop.

But the industry is headed toward more machine learning, not less. It provides a better way to train the car to do tasks like identifying lane makers, said Waymo’s vice president of engineering Dmitri Dolgov. But it becomes even more important, he explained, when a car needs a much deeper understanding of the world around it. “Robotics and machine learning go hand in hand,” he said.",What Virtual Reality Can Teach a Driverless Car,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/business/virtual-reality-driverless-cars.html

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

And Kevin Spacey, above, apologized after he was accused of sexually accosting a 14-year-old actor 31 years ago, but came under fire for using the same statement to come out as gay.

Sexual harassment claims also surfaced in Britain's Parliament. One minister was hanging onto his job after admitting he asked a staff member to buy sex toys. Dozens of lawmakers are accused of sexism and inappropriate behavior or worse.

Back Story

We begin Halloween with a ghost story.

Stingy Jack invited the devil for a drink.

As Irish folklore goes, Jack didn’t want to pay for the drinks, and instead convinced the devil to turn himself into a coin that could be used to settle the tab.

The devil agreed, but Jack ditched the tab and kept the coin. When he finally died, Stingy Jack was denied entry to both heaven and hell and instead was given a burning coal to light his way as he roamed the earth for eternity. He placed the coal in a carved-out turnip, turning it into a lantern.

Stingy Jack became known as “Jack of the Lantern,” or Jack-o’-Lantern, by the late 17th century. Elsewhere in Europe, making lanterns out of potatoes and beets was part of a fall harvest celebration. Lights were also thought to ward off evil spirits.

By the end of the 19th century, European immigrants in America switched their carving tradition over to pumpkins.

“The fortunate pumpkin is a noble fruit, a joy in the mouth of mankind, a paean of Autumn on the happy palate,” a 1942 Times article proclaimed. “The unfortunate pumpkin becomes a jack-o’-lantern.”

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle.
PhotoFew have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said.
A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

Photo

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

So when the owners of East River Tattoo fired back on Instagram, posting a screen shot of the Yelp review beside a caption that said, “Proud to be shattering your expectations of what a tattoo shop should be, every day of the week,” obviously an army of Sade obsessives rushed to the store’s side.

“All that says is your understanding of the world and what’s happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol,” one wrote.

Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet. But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.

This impact includes tattoos. More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adu’s visage over the last year or so. A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than they’d gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.

A post shared by Artὄ8ἿC Tattooὄ8ἿCLaserὄ8ἿC (@niki23gtr) on Mar 22, 2017 at 9:26am PDT

The most famous Sade tattoo, however, belongs to Drake. He premiered it on Instagram this March. In it, Ms. Adu’s hair is hidden, Nina Simone-like, beneath a turban.

In February 2017, the street wear brand Supreme put Ms. Adu’s image on a coveted limited-edition T-shirt. In March, Reese Witherspoon’s Type A character on “Big Little Lies” established her remove from pop culture when she hears Sade at a dinner party and mistakes it for Adele.

Demand for T-shirts from Sade’s 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chico’s Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.

Some of this Sade fever can be traced to Patrick Matamoros, 41, a high-end dealer who finds rare T-shirts, distresses them to perfection and then places them on to the backs of celebrity clients such as Rihanna, Diplo and Mark Ronson.

Photo

Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sade’s 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West. “I’d sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still don’t understand,” Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.

This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.

He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.

“I used to say to people about Sade, ‘This isn’t going to impress everyone in the room,” Mr. Matamoros said. “Get an Iron Maiden shirt if that’s what you want. Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.”

Photo

Not anymore. Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.

Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name. (Many Americans believe it’s pronounced Shar-day; it’s Sha-day.) In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sade’s disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.

Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.

For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the world’s most prestigious fashion school. To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the band’s “Love Deluxe” and “Lover’s Rock” albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.

She began singing backup in a local band, and moved to frontwoman only reluctantly. “The lead singer left,” she later said.

Photo

It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride. They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.

In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.

They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.

“She was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now,” said Susan Blond, a former vice president and publicity director at Epic who now heads an agency where clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.

“She was very young, but she was very sophisticated,” Ms. Blond said. “She didn’t follow anyone else’s style. No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her. She didn’t mind designer clothes, but you’d never ever look at her and say, ‘Oh that’s a Chanel outfit.’ She never looked like a brand. And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.”

In a way, Ms. Adu’s sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.

When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, “Smooth Operator,” she was lamenting what happens when “sentiment is left to chance.”

The saxophone signaled sorrow. Ms. Adu wasn’t asking — as Ms. Jones did — for a guy to “drive it in between.”

Shortly before Sade won the 1986 Grammy for best new artist, she appeared on “Saturday Night Live” with Tom Hanks, who recalled the experience in an email: “It was the first time I did ‘SNL,’ which is a major event an anyone’s life, a heady week of being surrounded by all that history. I’d never been in 30 Rock, much less invited to work on the 17th floor or in Studio 8-H. I thought the big talisman for being on ‘SNL’ was the job of saying ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, Sade.’ which is actually written on a cue card, by the way.’

Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence. Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade. She remains a Smooth Operator, no?”

Dan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sade’s first four albums, said, “There was grace to everything she did.”

Photo

Although Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasn’t because she was temperamental or diva-ish.

She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion. She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.

“She never enjoyed promotion of any type,” Mr. Beck said. “It was painful for her. Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal. I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period. I said, ‘You’ll hate it but we’ll get it all done and when you’re done you’re done.’ And she laughed, and that’s what we did for the next two albums after that.”

(She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turner’s career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)

As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer. She wanted to have normal relationships. She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.

Photo

Sade’s 1992 album, “Love Deluxe,” arrived four years after “Stronger Than Pride.” Ms. Adu smiled as she told Mr. Beck she might not have gone back into the studio to record — except the guys in the band wanted to return to work, he said. “I thought that was so sweet.” (In a 1992 interview she said, “It’s good that we stopped and didn’t try to make another one off the back of the previous album. You get some perspective on why you’re making a record.”)

Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sade’s videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.

“She said, ‘I don’t mind. I’ll do that for you, but I don’t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,’” Mr. Watson said. “I said, ‘The shoot is for you. You control all the images.’ Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.” Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.

A year later, Sade declined to release a house remix of “Pearls,” perhaps because there was something a little unseemly about people dancing to a song about the Somalian civil war. Then, a bootleg of it began making the rounds to D.J.s such as Junior Vasquez and Frankie Knuckles, who turned it into one of the era’s defining club tracks.

In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended. Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship. For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.

An eight-year stretch between albums yielded “Lover’s Rock,” which had lots about romance but also brought a quiet force to songs about issues facing black people. The video for “King of Sorrow” was a masterstroke of Sade-ness, where she wore ball gowns and a bandanna, scrubbing a child’s shoe clean. Was it a cautionary tale for single parenthood or a fashion spread devoted to it? Who could say. It was lovely.

By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts. With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.

All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew. The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade. The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.

Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.

One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious. Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form. (And the time away only helped build interest. The first tour for her 2001 album, “Lover’s Rock,” grossed $26 million. The second, for “Soldier of Love,” grossed $50 million.)

In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance. She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.

When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.

Ms. Adu can also sometimes be spotted on her cat-loving child’s Instagram. On Mother’s Day this year, this undated portrait was published. Back in January, on the day she turned 58, a recent picture appeared. She looks impeccably happy.

A post shared by Izaak Theo (@caracalonbenzos) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:21am PST

Even with so little of her, you can see her look everywhere. Just last week, T:, The New York Times Style Magazine put Nicki Minaj on a cover, her hair in a black ponytail, a pair of gold hoops dangling.

Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazine’s entertainment director, didn’t hesitate when asked whom they were channeling. “Sade,” she said. “You never know how someone’s going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres. Nicki saw the images and was like, ‘Sade, Oh my God. I love it.’ It felt expensive, cool and timeless.”

There’s talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isn’t sure.

“It’s always like that with Sade,” he said. “Time will go by and she’ll start working on it. For her, it’s like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning. You know you don’t want to do it, but at some point you just do it.”

“When we were having our first success with her, I said, ‘This lady could have a hit album when she’s 90 years old.’ Most artists try too hard,” Mr. Beck said. “And consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isn’t out there waving their résumé at you every five minutes.

Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner, apologized Sunday night for what he said “would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior” after the actor Anthony Rapp made an accusation about his sexual conduct with him 31 years ago, when Mr. Rapp was 14 years old.

Mr. Spacey, who has long been fiercely private about his personal life, said in a statement that he did not remember any such encounter, but added that Mr. Rapp’s accusation “has encouraged me to address other things about my life.” He then disclosed that he had “loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man.”

The rapid cycle of accusation and apology began Sunday evening, when BuzzFeed published an article in which Mr. Rapp alleged that Mr. Spacey “was trying to get with me sexually” after a party at Mr. Spacey’s apartment in 1986. After all the other guests had left, Mr. Rapp said that Mr. Spacey, who appeared intoxicated, “picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don’t, like, squirm away initially, because I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ And then he lays down on top of me.”

Mr. Rapp, who is best known for playing the character Mark Cohen in the original Broadway production of “Rent,” confirmed the contents of the article and said he had decided to speak out at a time when several women have accused the producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault.

“I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out, to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me,” Mr. Rapp said in an emailed statement. “Everything I wanted to say about my experience is in that article, and I have no further comment about it at this time.”

A United States District Court judge on Monday blocked a White House policy barring military service by transgender troops, noting that the policy did not appear to be based on facts, but instead on “a desire to express disapproval of transgender people generally.”

President Trump announced in a series of tweets in July that American forces could not afford the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of transgender troops, and said “the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” A presidential memorandum released in August required all transgender service members to be discharged by March.

Transgender groups sued the administration in late August on behalf of transgender service members, arguing that the ban was discriminatory and violated their constitutional right to due process equal protection under the law.

On Monday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia issued an injunction blocking enforcement of the ban until the case was resolved, saying the effect of the order was to revert to the status quo.

The judge — who was named to the court by President Bill Clinton — noted in her ruling that the changes in transgender policy were “not genuinely based on legitimate concerns regarding military effectiveness or budget constraints, but are instead driven by a desire to express disapproval of transgender people generally.”

The use of other modern techniques like forensic accounting, crowd sourcing, behavioral science and testimonial reconstruction may also hold promise of a breakthrough. The team, for example, is carrying out a three-dimensional scan of the original house and using computer models to determine how far sounds might have traveled.

Those techniques may allow them to re-evaluate old evidence — for instance, whether the knock on the wall, described in Anne Frank’s diary, was someone telling those hiding that they were being too loud, or whether it could have been a trap.

Such modern and expensive techniques were not available to the Dutch national police when they unsuccessfully investigated the case in 1948 and again in 1963.

Much is known about Anne Frank’s life during her two years in hiding, thanks both to her famous diary and the accounts of helpers and friends published after the war. But far less is known about the circumstances surrounding the raid on Aug. 4, 1944.

The raid ended her time in the house on the Prinsengracht and precipitated her long and torturous journey to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she is believed to have died in February 1945.

In a country from which an estimated 108,000 Jews were deported — of which only an estimated 5,500 returned — the reopening of the case is also part of a larger national conversation.

“She used to be the girl that we protected and now she has become the girl that we betrayed,” said Bart van der Boom, an expert on the Nazi occupation and a lecturer at Leiden University. “It’s a function of how the Dutch perceive themselves during the occupation.”

That perception changed in the 1960s, said Dr. van der Boom, when the Dutch started to question the traditional narrative that all Dutch people were victims of the Nazis. The Dutch Resistance Museum in Amsterdam, for example, now features a narrative thread describing the life of a collaborator, as well ones about people who stayed neutral, those who resisted and those who were victimized.

At least 28,000 Jews hid from the Germans during the four-year occupation of the Netherlands, Dr. van de Boom said. Of those, roughly a third were caught, the vast majority because of the efforts of a small band of paid of collaborators known in Dutch as “Jodenjagers,” or Jew hunters, he said.

“We don’t know what happened exactly on that fateful day, and there is something intriguing about an open end in a narrative,” said Ronald Leopold, the executive director of the Anne Frank House foundation, which runs the museum and conducts research into her life and death.

“Betrayers did not have the classical image we have of perpetrator, those uniformed faces of death,” Mr. Leopold said.

The figure of the betrayer is important in the life of Anne Frank because, unlike the police and soldiers that would be responsible for her death, the betrayer was possibly known by the Frank family, and almost certainly was not someone wearing an official uniform.

The list of possible subjects has been growing as researchers have proposed new names and theories. While Wilhelm van Maaren, a warehouse foreman, was the primary focus in both Dutch police investigations, the new investigation is open to all possibilities.

“When Otto Frank returned, in the summer of 1945, he assumed someone gave them up,” said Gertjan Broek, a senior historian at the Anne Frank House, which receives 1.3 million visitors a year. “It’s always been a firmly held belief.”

But while the idea that the police were tipped off has long been part of the Anne Frank story, not everyone is convinced that betrayal necessarily played a role.

Dr. Broek published a 37-page report in December 2016 proposing the theory that the police were at the address on another mission, and found the lodgers only by chance.

Researchers in the Netherlands have welcomed the new investigation, and Dr. Broek is serving as one of its advisers.

“What is new about this one is that it looks at the case with forensic eyes,” Mr. Leopold said. “And we look forward to the results.”

The investigative team — which also includes Roger Depue, a retired F.B.I. behavioral scientist, among its 20 members and consultants — hopes to reveal its progress on Aug. 4, 2019, exactly 75 years after the raid.

Thijs Bayens, an organizer of the investigation and a filmmaker who plans to make a documentary about it, said the cost of the work would run into six digits, and the group is collecting donations on its website. Mr. Pankoke is keeping a diary of the investigation on the group’s website.

During his 27-year career, Mr. Pankoke said, he worked on a squad aimed at Colombian drug traffickers in the 1990s, and investigated the cellphone communications of the Sept. 11 hijackers. Working in an undercover unit, he played the part of a financier to investigate crimes on Wall Street.

The new team has made progress already, Mr. Pankoke said. Someone claiming to be a neighbor of the now-famous annex left information on the investigators’ tip page that pointed to another nearby resident as having collaborated with Nazis. Mr. Pankoke said his team would follow up.

He said he hoped that reopening the case would reawaken people’s awareness of the Holocaust, memories of which he fears are receding in an era genocides and other atrocities.

“Part of the story is being lost to the sands of time,” Mr. Pankoke said. “If we accomplish nothing else — and I’m certain we will, I have a great team — we are bringing attention to the issue.”",Who Betrayed Anne Frank?

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

Behold a child.

A slight girl all of 6, she leaves the modest family farm, where the father minds the livestock and the mother keeps a painful secret, and walks out to the main road. Off she goes to primary school, off to the Sisters of Mercy.

IRELAND Tuam Dublin GALWAY

Her auburn hair in ringlets, this child named Catherine is bound for Tuam, the ancient County Galway town whose name derives from a Latin term for “burial mound.” It is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese, a proud distinction announced by the skyscraping cathedral that for generations has loomed over factory and field.

Two miles into this long-ago Irish morning, the young girl passes through a gantlet of gray formed by high walls along the Dublin Road that seem to thwart sunshine. To her right runs the Parkmore racecourse, where hard-earned shillings are won or lost by a nose. And to her left, the mother and baby home, with glass shards embedded atop its stony enclosure.

Behind this forbidding divide, nuns keep watch over unmarried mothers and their children. Sinners and their illegitimate spawn, it is said. The fallen.

But young Catherine knows only that the children who live within seem to be a different species altogether: sallow, sickly — segregated. “Home babies,” they’re called.

The girl’s long walk ends at the Mercy school, where tardiness might earn you a smarting whack on the hand. The children from the home are always late to school — by design, it seems, to keep them from mingling with “legitimate” students. Their oversize hobnail boots beat a frantic rhythm as they hustle to their likely slap at the schoolhouse door.

A sensitive child, familiar with the sting of playground taunts, Catherine nevertheless decides to repeat a prank she saw a classmate pull on one of these children. She balls up an empty candy wrapper and presents it to a home baby as if it still contains a sweet, then watches as the little girl’s anticipation melts to sad confusion.

Everyone laughs, nearly. This moment will stay with Catherine forever.

After classes end, the home babies hurry back down the Dublin Road in two straight lines, boots tap-tap-tapping, and disappear behind those Gothic walls. Sometimes the dark wooden front door is ajar, and on her way home Catherine thrills at the chance of a stolen peek.

Beyond those glass-fanged walls lay seven acres of Irish suffering. Buried here somewhere are famine victims who succumbed to starvation and fever a century earlier, when the home was a loathed workhouse for the homeless poor.

But they are not alone.

Deep in the distant future, Catherine will expose this property’s appalling truths. She will prompt a national reckoning that will leave the people of Ireland asking themselves: Who were we? Who are we?

At the moment, though, she is only a child. She is walking home to a father tending to the cattle and a mother guarding a secret, away from the Irish town whose very name conjures the buried dead.

Ritual and Remembrance

In Ireland, the departed stay present.

You might still come across old-timers who recall how families in rural stretches would clean the house and set out a drink on the first night of November — the eve of All Souls’ Day — in the belief that the dead will return. How it was best to stay in the center of the road when walking at night, so as not to disturb the spirits resting along the wayside.

Even today, the Irish say they do death well. Local radio newscasts routinely end with a recitation of death notices. In a country where the culture of Catholicism, if not its practice, still holds sway, this alerts the community to a familiar ritual: the wake at the home, the funeral Mass, the long gathering at the pub, the memorial Mass a month later, and the anniversary Mass every year thereafter.

Wry acceptance of mortality lives in the country’s songs, literature, and wit. A standard joke is the Irish marriage proposal: “Would you like to be buried with my people?” A standard song describes a thrown bottle splattering whiskey – from the Irish for “water of life” — over a corpse. Thus the late Tim Finnegan is revived at his wake; see how he rises.

Respect for burial grounds runs deep, with crowds gathering in their local cemetery once a year to pray as a priest blesses the dead within. This reverence for the grave may derive from centuries of land dispossession, or passed-on memories of famine corpses in the fields and byways, or simply be linked to a basic desire expressed by the planting of a headstone:

To be remembered.

Some 60 years have passed since Catherine’s primary school days. It is a gloomy June afternoon, and she is walking the grounds once hidden behind those shard-studded walls. As rain falls from the crow-flecked sky, she drapes her black jacket over her head, almost like a shawl.

Her name now is Catherine Corless, née Farrell. At 63, she is a grandmother with a smile not easily given, and any fealty to Catholicism long since lost.

True, she occasionally volunteers to paint the weathered statues outside the local country churches: the blue of the Blessed Virgin’s eyes, the bronze in St. Patrick’s beard. But this is for the community, not the church. She finds deeper meaning in her garden, in the birds at the feeder outside her kitchen window, in the earth here at her feet.

Few photographs exist of the grim building that once loomed over this corner of Tuam (pronounced Chewm), perhaps because few desired the memory. In its place stand drab rows of subsidized housing and a modest playground. A silvery swing set, a yellow slide, a jungle gym.

One day, a few years back, Catherine began to inquire about the old home that had stoked her schoolgirl imagination. She set out on an amateur’s historical quest, but whenever she focused on the children who lived there, so many questions arose about the children who died there — the ones who never made it to the classroom, or even past infancy.

What, then, of Patrick Derrane, who died at five months in 1925, and Mary Carty, at five months in 1960, and all those in between, children said to have been “born on the other side of the blanket”? The Bridgets and Noras and Michaels and Johns, and so many Marys, so many Patricks, their surnames the common language of Ireland.

Would people pause at their graves? Would they be remembered?

In asking around, what Catherine heard was:

Ah, them poor children. Them poor children.

The more she dug, the more a distant time and place was revealed. Now, standing on the sodden grass, she can nearly see and hear all that was. The polished halls and bustling dormitories, the babies’ nappies and nuns’ habits, the shouts, the whimpers, the murmur of prayer.

‘Waiting for the Crucifixion’

The women and their newborns often arrived after the inquisitive streetlamps of Tuam had dimmed. They came from towns and crossroads with names like snatches of song. Portumna and Peterswell, Claremorris and Lettermore, Moylough and Loughrea.

And now they were here at the St. Mary’s Mother and Baby Home, a massive building the color of storm clouds, a way station for 50 single mothers and 125 children born out of wedlock.

The building opened in 1846 as a workhouse, but almost immediately it began receiving victims of the Great Hunger, a famine so horrific that the moans of the dying, The Tuam Herald reported, were “as familiar to our ears as the striking of the clock.” It later became a military barracks, serving the new Irish government formed after a treaty between Irish rebels and Great Britain in 1921. One spring morning during the civil war that followed, six prisoners — republicans who disagreed with concessions in the treaty — were marched into the yard and executed against the ashen wall.

The government repurposed the building to be among the institutions intended as ports of salvation where disgraced women might be redeemed. These state-financed homes were invariably managed by a Catholic order, in keeping with the hand-in-glove relationship between the dominant church and the fledgling state.

Given the misogyny, morality, and economics that informed the public debate of the time — when a pregnancy out of wedlock could threaten a family’s plans for land inheritance, and even confer dishonor upon a local pastor — imagine that naïve young woman from the country: impregnated by a man, sometimes a relative, who would assume little of the shame and none of the responsibility. She might flee to England, or pretend that the newborn was a married sister’s — or be shipped to the dreaded Tuam home, run by a religious order with French roots called the Congregation of Sisters of Bon Secours.

Their motto: “Good Help to Those in Need.”

You rose early and went down to the nursery with your infant. Mass at 8, then porridge and tea for breakfast. Breast feeding next, after which you rinsed your child’s diapers before moving on to your daily drudgery. You might polish the dormitory floors with beeswax or clean bedsheets stained with urine.

“An awful lonely ould hole,” recalled Julia Carter Devaney.

Born in a workhouse and left in the care of the Bon Secours, Julia became an employee who lived in the home for almost 40 years. Although she died in 1985, her rare insight into this insulated world — one she described as “unnatural” — lives on in taped interviews.

The gates remained unlocked to accommodate deliveries, but so powerful was the sense of cultural imprisonment that you dared not leave. Save for the chance gift of a cake from the bread man, you starved for love or consolation over the loss of your innocent courting days.

“Many a girl shed tears,” Julia said.

The Bon Secours sisters who watched your every move were doing the bidding of Irish society. They, too, existed in a repressive patriarchy with few options for women. They might have experienced a spiritual calling as a young girl, or simply desired not to be a farmer’s wife, having seen overworked mothers forever pregnant, forever fretting. A vocation offered education, safety and status, all reflected in clean, freshly pressed habits.

And Julia remembered them all.

Mother Hortense had a big heart, yet was quick to punish; Mother Martha was more enlightened, but a thump from her could “put you into the middle of next week.” This one hated the mere sight of children, while that one used kindness the way others used the rod. So it went.

The sisters frequently threatened banishment to the mental asylum in Ballinasloe, or to one of the Magdalen Laundries: institutions where women perceived to be susceptible or errant — including “second offenders” who had become pregnant again — were often sent to work, and sometimes die, in guilt-ridden servitude.

You preferred instead to suffer at the mother and baby home, bracing for that day when, after a year or so of penitent confinement, you were forced to leave — almost always without your child. Waiting for that moment of separation, Julia recalled, was “like Our Lady waiting for the Crucifixion.”

Typical is the story of one unmarried woman who had been sent to the home from a remote Galway farm. Determined to remain close to her child, she took a job as a cleaner at a nearby hospital and, for several years, she appeared at the home’s door on her day off every week to say the same thing:

That’s my son you have in there. I want my son. I want to rear him.

No, would come the answer. And the door would close.

For the children left behind, there were swings and seesaws and donated Christmas gifts from town, but no grandparents and cousins coming around to coo. They lived amid the absence of affection and the ever-present threat of infectious disease.

“Like chickens in a coop,” Julia said.

Many survivors have only the sketchiest memories of those days, a haze of bed-wetting and rocking oneself to sleep. One man, now in his 70s, remembers being taken for a walk with other home babies, and the excitement of seeing themselves in the side-view mirrors of parked cars.

“We didn’t even know it was a reflection of ourselves in the mirror,” he recalled. “And we were laughing at ourselves. Laughing.”

Until they were adopted, sent to a training school or boarded out to a family, the older children walked to one of the two primary schools along the Dublin Road, some of them calling out “daddy” and “mammy” to strangers in the street. Shabby and betraying signs of neglect, they sat at the back of the classroom, apart.

“I never remember them really being taught,” Catherine said. “They were just there.”

Teachers threatened to place rowdy students beside the home babies. Parents warned children that if they were bad they’d go right to “the home.” And even though the babies were baptized as a matter of routine, there remained the hint of sulfur about them.

“They were the children of the Devil,” recalled Kevin O’Dwyer, 67, a retired principal who grew up just yards from the home. “We learned this in school.”

Still, when a bully targeted a young Kevin during one recess, the child who came to his rescue was a home baby. You leave him alone, the older girl warned. I see you doing that to him again, I’ll get ya.

The man has never forgotten his protector’s name: Mary Curran.

One September day in 1961, a rare and ferocious hurricane howled across Ireland, downing power lines, destroying barley fields, battering cottages. As gales flicked away slates from the roof above, Julia helped lock the doors of the mother and baby home for good. Its conditions were poor, some of its staff untrained, and County Galway officials decided not to proceed with a planned renovation.

Abandoned, the massive H-block building devolved into an echoing, eerie playscape, where games of hide-and-seek unfolded in dull halls once polished with beeswax. Even the old chapel became a place where children became the priests and confessors. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I shot Brother Whatever,” Kevin recalled. “That kind of thing.”

The years passed. Galway County moved forward with plans to demolish the home and build subsidized housing. And the memories of hobnailed pitter-patter faded, replaced by the faint sounds of children outracing the home baby ghosts that inhabited the property at night.

In Pain, Finding Purpose

Catherine still wonders what led her to the story of the mother and baby home. Chance, perhaps, or distant memories of the little girl she once teased. Despite her bone-deep modesty, there are even times when she feels chosen.

She thinks back to her solitary childhood, her best friend a dog she called “Puppy,” her time spent navigating the sadness that enveloped her mother. She admired the woman’s deep empathy for others, but was puzzled by her refusal to say much about her own people back in County Armagh, a good 140 miles northeast of Tuam. Sure they’re all dead and gone, is all she’d say, and God help you if you pried much further.

“A troubled soul,” her daughter said.

Catherine graduated from secondary school, left a Galway art college for fear of lacking the necessary talent, and found satisfaction as a receptionist. In 1978, she married Aidan Corless, a man as gregarious as she was shy, a fine singer, nimble on the accordion, comfortable on the community theater stage.

Four children quickly followed. Before long, Catherine was minding the children of neighbors as well, immersing herself in the homework, play and exuberance of the young.

Her mother, Kathleen, died at 80 in 1992, leaving behind so much unsaid. Catherine eventually headed up to Armagh to examine public records that might explain why her mother had been so withholding, so unsettled.

As if part of some cosmic riddle, the answer was provided in the absence of one. On her mother’s birth certificate, in the space reserved for the name of the father: nothing.

Her mother had been conceived out of wedlock.

Other telltale strands to the woman’s early years came to be known: Fostered out, moving from family to family before finding work as a domestic. Then harboring until death a secret she found shameful enough to keep from her husband.

“That she went through her life, that she didn’t like telling us,” Catherine said. “That she was ashamed to tell us…”

In this patch of pain and regret, a seed was planted.

The revelations about her mother fueled in Catherine an interest in understanding the forces that shape who we are and how we behave. While attending a rigorous night course in local history, she learned an invaluable lesson:

“If you don’t find something, you don’t leave it. You ask why it’s not there. You use ‘why’ a lot.”

With the children grown, Catherine began contributing essays to the journal of the Old Tuam Society about local history, all the while grappling with debilitating headaches and anxiety attacks. The episodes might last for days, with the only relief at times coming from lying on the floor, still, away from light.

Burrowing deep into the past, though, provided welcome distraction, and at some point she chose to delve into the subject of the old mother and baby home: its beginnings as a workhouse, its place in Tuam history, the usual. Nothing deep.

But there were almost no extant photographs of the home, and most of the locals were reluctant to talk. Every question Catherine raised led to another, the fullness of truth never quite within reach. Why, for example, did one corner of the property feature a well-manicured grotto centered around a statue of the Blessed Virgin?

Oh that, a few neighbors said. A while back an older couple created the peaceful space to mark where two local lads once found some bones in a concrete pit. Famine victims, maybe.

The story made no sense to Catherine. The famine dead weren’t buried that way.

Who were these boys? What did they see?

Frannie Hopkins was about 9, Barry Sweeney, about 7. The two were at the fledgling stage of boyhood mischief as they monkeyed around some crab apple trees, all within view of the deserted home that figured in their fertile imagination.

Some evenings, Frannie’s father would delay his pint at the Thatch Bar, at the top of the town, until he had watched his son race down the Athenry Road, dodging ghosts from the old home to his left and the cemetery to his right, all the way to the family’s door. But on this autumn day in the early 1970s, the boys were daring in the daylight.

Jumping into some overgrowth at the property’s southwest corner, they landed on a concrete slab that echoed in answer. Curious, they pushed aside the lid to reveal a shallow, tank-like space containing a gruesome jumble of skulls and bones.

Frannie nudge-bumped Barry, and the younger lad fell in. He started to cry, as any boy would, so Frannie pulled him out and then the two boys were running away, laughing in fun or out of fright. They told everyone they met, prompting Frannie’s father to say he’d get a right kick in the arse if he went back to that spot.

County workers soon arrived to level that corner of the property. The police said they were only famine bones. A priest said a prayer. And that was that.

In adulthood, Barry Sweeney would go to England to find work, and Frannie Hopkins would travel the world as an Irish soldier. Both would return to Tuam, where their shared story would come up now and then in the pub or on the street.

People would tell them they were either mistaken or lying. Barry would become upset that anyone would doubt a story that had so affected him, but Frannie would take pains to reassure him.

Barry, he would say. The truth will out.

The Marys, Patricks and Johns

Now, 40 years later, here was Catherine Corless, amateur historian, trying to unearth that truth, applying what she had learned in her community center research class: Use “why” a lot.

When her headaches and panic attacks eased, she pored over old newspapers in a blur of microfilm. She spent hours studying historic maps in the special collections department of the library at the national university in Galway City. One day she copied a modern map of Tuam on tracing paper and placed it over a town map from 1890.

And there it was, in the cartographic details from another time: A tank for the home’s old septic system sat precisely where the two boys had made their ghastly discovery. It was part of the Victorian-era system’s warren of tunnels and chambers, all of which had been disconnected in the late 1930s.

Did this mean, then, that the two lads had stumbled upon the bones of home babies? Buried in an old sewage area?

“I couldn’t understand it,” Catherine said. “The horror of the idea.”

Acting on instinct, she purchased a random sample from the government of 200 death certificates for children who had died at the home. Then, sitting at the Tuam cemetery’s edge in the van of its caretaker, she checked those death certificates against all the burials recorded by hand in two oversize books.

Only two children from the home had been buried in the town graveyard. Both were orphans, both “legitimate.”

Neither the Bon Secours order nor the county council could explain the absence of burial records for home babies, although it was suggested that relatives had probably claimed the bodies to bury in their own family plots. Given the ostracizing stigma attached at the time to illegitimacy, Catherine found this absurd.

In December 2012, Catherine’s essay, titled “The Home,” appeared in the historical journal of Tuam. After providing a general history of the facility, it laid out the results of her research, including the missing burial records and the disused septic tank where two boys had stumbled upon some bones.

“Is it possible that a large number of those little children were buried in that little plot at the rear of the former Home?” she wrote. “And if so, why is it not acknowledged as a proper cemetery?”

She also shared her own memories, including that joke she and a classmate had played on two home babies long ago. “I thought it funny at the time how those little girls hungrily grabbed the empty sweet papers, but the memory of it now haunts me,” she wrote.

Her daring essay implicitly raised a provocative question: Had Catholic nuns, working in service of the state, buried the bodies of hundreds of children in the septic system?

Catherine braced for condemnation from government and clergy — but none came. It was as if she had written nothing at all.

There was a time when Catherine wanted only to have a plaque erected in memory of these forgotten children. But now she felt that she owed them much more. “No one cared,” she said. “And that’s my driving force all the time: No one cared.”

She kept digging, eventually paying for another spreadsheet that listed the names, ages, and death dates of all the “illegitimate” children who had died in the home during its 36-year existence.

The sobering final tally: 796.

Five-month-old Patrick Derrane was the first to die, from gastroenteritis. Weeks later, Mary Blake, less than 4 months old and anemic since birth. A month after that, 3-month-old Matthew Griffin, of meningitis. Then James Murray, fine one moment, dead the next. He was 4 weeks old.

In all, seven children died at the mother and baby home in 1925, the year it opened. The holidays were especially tough, with 11-month-old Peter Lally dying of intestinal tuberculosis on Christmas Day, and 1-year-old Julia Hynes dying the next day, St. Stephen’s Day, after a three-month bout of bronchitis.

Measles. Influenza. Gastroenteritis. Meningitis. Whooping cough. Tuberculosis. Severe undernourishment, also known as marasmus.

Nine home babies died in 1930. Eleven in 1931. Twenty-four in 1932. Thirty-two in 1933.

The Tuam home was not alone. Children born out of wedlock during this period were nearly four times more likely to die than “legitimate” children, with those in institutions at particular risk. The reasons may be many — poor prenatal care, insufficient government funding, little or no training of staff – but this is certain: It was no secret.

In 1934, the Irish parliament was informed of the inordinate number of deaths among this group of children. “One must come to the conclusion that they are not looked after with the same care and attention as that given to ordinary children,” a public health official said.

Thirty died in the Tuam home that year.

In 1938, it was 26. In 1940, 34. In 1944, 40.

In 1947, a government health inspector filed a report describing the conditions of infants in the nursery: “a miserable emaciated child…delicate…occasional fits…emaciated and delicate…fragile abscess on hip…not thriving wizened limbs emaciated…pot-bellied emaciated…a very poor baby…”

That year, 52 died.

Catherine felt obligated to these children. Continuing to plumb the depths of the past, she eventually cross-checked her spreadsheet of 796 deceased home babies with the burial records of cemeteries throughout counties Galway and Mayo. Not one match.

“They’re not in the main Tuam graveyard where they should have been put initially,” she remembers thinking. “They’re not in their mothers’ hometown graveyards. Where are they?”

Catherine, of course, already knew.

The Truth Outs, a Nation Reels

Catherine lives simply, almost monastically. She favors practical clothing, usually black, and has never been one for a night at the pub. She doesn’t drink alcohol or eat meat. Give her a bowl of muesli at the kitchen table and she’ll be grand.

Those headaches and anxiety attacks, though, remain a part of her withdrawn life. Aidan, her husband, has become accustomed to attending wakes and weddings by himself. A few years ago, he booked a Mediterranean cruise for two; he traveled alone.

“A very quiet, introverted person, wrapped up in her own thoughts,” Aidan said of his wife. “Suffering, if you like.”

But thoughts of the dead children of Tuam pushed Catherine beyond her fears. Believing that the body of even one “legitimate” baby found in a septic tank would have prompted an outcry, she suspected that the silence met by her essay spoke to a reluctance to revisit the painful past — a past that had consumed her own mother.

Now she was angry.

Adding to her fury was the knowledge that when a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours closed in 2002, the religious order disinterred the bodies of a dozen nuns and reinterred them in consecrated ground outside the nearby pilgrimage town of Knock.

“I feel it at times: that those poor little souls were crying out for recognition, a recognition they never got in their little, short lives,” Catherine said. “It was a wrong that just had to be righted some way.”

Seeing no other option, she contacted a reporter for The Irish Mail on Sunday, a national newspaper. Not long after, in the spring of 2014, a front-page story appeared about a certain seven acres in Tuam.

It became the talk of Ireland.

All who had been quiet before — the clerics, politicians and government officials — now conveyed shock and sadness, while the besieged Bon Secours sisters hired a public relations consultant whose email to a documentarian did little for the religious order’s reputation:

“If you come here, you’ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying ‘Yeah, a few bones were found — but this was an area where Famine victims were buried. So?’”

The news from Tuam had shocked many in the country, but the dismissive email reflected the lurking doubts about Catherine’s work. She was, after all, only a housewife.

Mary Moriarty was getting her light-blond hair done at a salon in Tuam one day when the beauty-parlor chatter turned to this troublemaker Catherine Corless.

The entire matter should be forgotten and put behind us, someone said.

Mary, a grandmother well known in town for her advocacy work, would have none of it.

Well, she said. Every child is entitled to their name, and their mothers could be any one of us but for the grace of God.

She left the salon, introduced herself by telephone to Catherine, and recounted a story that she rarely shared.

In 1975, Mary was a young married mother living in one of the new subsidized houses built on the old mother and baby home property. One morning, close to Halloween, a neighbor told her that a boy was running about with a skull on a stick.

The boy, Martin, said he had found his prize in the overgrown muck, and there were loads more.

What the boy mistook for a plastic toy was actually the skull of a child, with a nearly complete set of teeth. “That’s not plastic, Martin,” Mary recalled saying. “You have to put it back where you found it.”

Mary and a couple of neighbors followed the boy through the weeds and rubble, across the soft wet ground. Suddenly, the earth beneath her feet began to give, and down she fell into some cave or tunnel, with just enough light to illuminate the subterranean scene.

As far as she could see were little bundles stacked one on top of another, like packets in a grocery, each about the size of a large soda bottle and wrapped tight in graying cloth.

When her friends pulled her up, Mary’s legs were scratched and her mind was on fire. What had she seen? That very morning, she reached out to a person in town who might know. Soon a stout older woman arrived on a bicycle, her faithful dogs trotting by her side.

Julia Carter Devaney, who used to work at the home.

“Ah, yeah, that’s where the little babies is,” Mary recalled her saying as she came to a stop.

Julia bent down at the hole and peered in. Mary never forgot what the older woman said next: “Many a little one I carried out in the nighttime.”

Mary did not know what to make of this. Perhaps these were the bodies of stillborns – and therefore unbaptized. Stillborns. Yes, that’s what they must be.

Eighteen months after falling into the hole, Mary gave birth to her son Kevin at a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours sisters. After breakfast, a nun presented her with her newborn, who was swathed like a little mummy. The young mother’s mind instantly recalled those stacks of graying bundles, and straightaway she unwrapped her precious child.

Now, after listening to the woman’s tale, Catherine asked whether Mary would be willing to tell her story on national radio.

Of course.

The Dead and the Living

The veteran geophysicist guided her mower-like contraption over the thick grass, back and forth across a carefully measured grid. Equipped with ground-penetrating radar, the machine sent radio waves through the topsoil and down into the dark earth.

The curious machine was hunting for secrets concealed in the ground of the old mother and baby home, all beneath the gaze of a statue of the Blessed Virgin.

This subterranean trawling was being conducted on an early autumn day in 2015 for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, a panel created by an embarrassed government in response to Catherine’s research. Its charge: to examine a once-accepted way of Irish life in all its social and historical complexity.

The commission’s investigation into the homes — a network that by the late 1970s was falling into disuse — is focused on 18 institutions scattered across Ireland: in the capital city of Dublin, and in Counties Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kilkenny, Meath, Tipperary and Westmeath. The high infant mortality rate in some of these facilities was startling. In the Bessborough home in Cork, 478 children died from 1934 to 1953 — or about one death every two weeks.

The investigation’s broad mandate also includes scrutiny of the network’s links to the notorious Magdalen Laundries. The apparent coercion of unmarried mothers to surrender their children for adoption, often to Catholic Americans. The vaccine trials carried out on mother-and-baby-home children for pharmaceutical companies. The use of home-baby remains for anatomical study at medical colleges.

It was all part of a church-state arrangement that, decades earlier, a longtime government health inspector named Alice Litster had repeatedly denounced, mostly to silence. This system marginalized defenseless Irish women, she asserted, and turned their unfortunate offspring into “infant martyrs of convenience, respectability, and fear.”

The Tuam case incited furious condemnation of a Catholic Church already weakened by a litany of sexual abuse scandals. Others countered that the sisters of Bon Secours had essentially been subcontractors of the Irish state.

But laying the blame entirely on the church or the state seemed too simple — perhaps even too convenient. After all, many of these abandoned children had fathers and grandparents and aunts and uncles.

The bitter truth was that the mother and baby homes mirrored the Mother Ireland of the time.

As its investigation continued, the commission would occasionally provide cryptic updates of its work in Tuam. In September 2016, for example, it announced that forensic archaeologists would be digging trenches to resolve questions “in relation to the interment of human remains.”

While she waited for the commission to complete its work, the woman responsible for this national self-examination, Catherine Corless, returned in a way to those days when her children and the children of neighbors packed the house. Only now the ones gathering about her were in their 60s and 70s, with hair of silver.

Home babies.

Often lost in the uproar over the many children who died at the Tuam home were the stories of those who had survived. And once Catherine’s research became international news, they began calling and emailing her, seeing in this introverted woman their only hope of trying to find out who their mothers were, who their siblings were — who they were.

Catherine assumed the role of pro bono private detective, following paper trails that often led to some cemetery in England, where many unmarried mothers had gone to start anew. The children they were separated from, she said, needed to hear that their mother had “fared all right.”

Before long, some of these survivors were gathering at the Corless house for a cup of tea and a chat. In their habits and manners of speech, they reminded Catherine of someone close to her who also had been born out of wedlock.

“They all have a kind of low self-esteem,” she said. “They feel inadequate. They feel a bit inferior to other people. It mirrored, really, the way my mother was.”

During her research, Catherine had built a detailed, wood-and-clay model of the home, large enough to cover a dining-room table. It had helped her to visualize.

Now she and Aidan would occasionally remove the model from a high shelf in the barn out back so that survivors could do the same. They would touch the gray walls and peer into the small windows, as if to imagine themselves in the arms of their mothers.

P. J. Haverty, a retired mechanic, sat at the Corless kitchen table one day, sipping tea and eating a ham-and-butter sandwich. He was born in 1951, the son of a 27-year-old woman who had been left at the home by her father when she was eight months pregnant. Eileen was her name, and she seemed to vanish a year after giving birth.

The white-haired man remembers only a few snapshot moments of the home. Wetting the bed mattresses that would then be propped against the window to dry. Seeing himself for the first time in a car’s side-view mirror. Walking out the door with his new foster parents, the father choosing him because he looked sturdy for farm work, the mother because he had smiled at her.

P. J. was happy enough until his teens, when he was called a “bastard,” and people avoided the pew he sat in, and girls at a dance tittered at the sight of him. “If the parents found out,” he said, “they’d tell them to keep away from that lad, you don’t know where he came from.”

He considered drowning himself in the fast-moving river that coursed through his foster father’s field. “The things that I was called,” he said. “I just thought everyone was against me.”

Thanks to a hint dropped here, a secret whispered there, P. J. managed in adulthood to locate his birth mother in South London. Plump and with graying hair, she reassured him that she hadn’t abandoned him. After leaving the Tuam home, she had taken a cleaning job at a nearby hospital and, for more than five years, returned every week to demand that she be given back her child — only to be turned away at the door.

P. J.’s voice caught as he recalled what his mother, now dead, had said she told the nuns to no avail.

“That’s my son you have in there. I want to rear him. I want to look after him.”

‘Chamber of Horrors’

It was true.

In early March of this year, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission reported that “significant quantities of human remains” had been discovered on the grounds of the Tuam home.

The ground-penetrating radar and delicate excavation had revealed what appeared to be a decommissioned septic tank. And in 17 of that septic system’s 20 chambers, investigators found many human bones. A small sampling revealed that they were of children, ranging in age from 35 fetal weeks to three years, and all dating from the home’s 36 years of operation.

Expressing shock, the commission vowed to continue its investigation into “who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way.”

Once again, Ireland’s past had returned to haunt.

His voice trembling with passion, the prime minister, Enda Kenny, addressed the Irish legislature on what he called the “chamber of horrors” discovered in Tuam. In the “so-called good old days,” he said, Irish society “did not just hide away the dead bodies of tiny human beings.”

“We dug deep and we dug deeper still,” he said. “To bury our compassion, to bury our mercy, to bury our humanity itself.”

Though the prime minister said that “no nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children,” others directed their wrath at the Catholic Church and, of course, the Bon Secours order, whose only response so far has been to express its “continued cooperation and support” for the commission’s work.

The Corless household, meanwhile, became an international newsroom, with family members fielding the constant telephone calls and accommodating the television crews forever at the door. Catherine answered every question out of duty, not vanity. But when Ireland’s most popular television program, “The Late Late Show,” invited her to appear as a guest, she balked.

There was her ever-present anxiety, which now limited her driving to little more than weekly five-mile runs to the SuperValu grocery in Tuam. More than that, she feared being accused of self-aggrandizement at the expense of dead children.

With her family all but demanding that she accept — Imagine how many home-baby survivors, suffering in silence, might be reached — Catherine reluctantly consented, but only if she would already be seated when the program returned from a commercial break. She did not want to be summoned from the curtain to unwanted applause.

Aidan drove her into Galway City to buy an outfit: black pants and a black top, of course, brightened slightly with a silver trim. Then up to Dublin.

“I was a mess,” Catherine recalled. “But I said: ‘This is it. I have to do it.’”

When she finished telling the story of the Tuam home on live television, the audience rose in what the host described as a very rare standing ovation. Catherine nodded, smiled slightly, tightly, and exhaled. Watching on a monitor in an adjacent room, her husband fought back tears.

“I’m married to her for 40 years,” he said later, still astonished. “And I don’t know her at all.”

Catherine’s Final Quest

Photographs of grandchildren adorn the tan walls. A silver kettle rests on the stove. A laptop computer sits open on the counter, beside a window that looks out on a garden, a bird feeder and, beyond, an undulating field of grass.

This is the kitchen of Catherine Corless, and her office. She conducts her online research here, and keeps assorted documents on the kitchen table for easy retrieval when yet another call comes in. Can you help me find my mother, my sister, my… She never refuses.

The future of the Tuam grounds that her questioning disturbed has yet to be revealed. The government is grappling with many complexities, including the sad fact that the remains of infants and children, the Marys and Patricks, the Bridgets and Johns, are commingled.

One option is to leave everything as is. Another is to disinter the remains for possible identification and proper burial — although it is unclear whether DNA evidence can be recovered from those who died so young, and so long ago.

Other issues also need resolution. Potential compensation for home baby survivors; litigation against the Bon Secours sisters, who run a vast health-care network; the propriety of children playing above the bones of other children.

And there remains the maddening mystery of why a Catholic order of nuns would bury these children in such a manner. Was it to save a few pounds for the cost of each burial? Was it meant as a kind of catacombs, in echo of the order’s French roots?

The baptism of these children entitled them under canon law to a funeral Mass and burial in consecrated ground. But perhaps the baptismal cleansing of their “original sin” was not enough to also wipe away the shameful nature of their conception. Perhaps, having been born out of wedlock in an Ireland of another time, they simply did not matter.

Her auburn hair cut short, Catherine stands now at her computer, gazing through the window at the garden that blesses her with a sense of oneness with it all. Her begonias are blood-red bursts, her lobelias the bluest of blue, her mind forever returning to the past.

A candy wrapper. Empty.

She has searched school and government records many, many times. So far, though, she has been unable to find the name of one particular little girl from the mother and baby home, her long-ago classmate.

“It would be nice to meet her,” Catherine says, leaving no doubt as to what she would say if given the chance.",The Lost Children of Tuam,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/world/europe/tuam-ireland-babies-children.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Op-Ed Contributor Manafort Indictment Is Bad News for Trump

Just hours after the revelation of federal indictments against President Trump’s former campaign chairman and chief strategist, Paul Manafort, and his former campaign deputy, Rick Gates, the administration’s first response came in the form, of course, of a tweet from the president: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”

Expect to hear this line repeatedly from the president and his defenders: The indictments, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy, are a vindication of President Trump because he was not charged and because of the absence of allegations about campaign collusion with Russia. But they’re wrong — the president should be very worried.

For one thing, it is now clear that President Trump closely relied upon Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates while they were engaged in alleged criminal activity. That is a damning indictment of the president’s judgment. Their prosecution will hang over him and his administration for the foreseeable future, since these proceedings will continue for many months, and perhaps years. And these are unlikely to be the last of the charges pursued by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, who is also reported to be looking at other actors , including the president himself.

The idea that Mr. Manafort’s indictment vindicates Mr. Trump also ignores how complex criminal investigations typically proceed, and the attendant peril Mr. Trump now faces. In our half century of collective experience prosecuting and defending criminal cases, we have watched repeatedly as prosecutors charged lower-level individuals with readily provable offenses that are distinct from the core conduct and targets that are the primary focus of the prosecutor’s investigation.

It’s also significant that Mr. Mueller threw the book at Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates. Because the federal sentencing guidelines recommend a significant prison sentence for money-laundering offenses and are largely driven by the dollar amounts involved in the crime, this indictment, which involves millions of dollars, puts tremendous pressure on them to make a cooperation deal with the special counsel’s office to try to reduce the lengthy prison sentences each could face.

The power of this “squeeze play” approach is demonstrated by the other filing released today , reflecting a guilty plea by George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser who admits to communications with foreign individuals during the campaign, including at least one about the Russians’ possessing “dirt” concerning Hillary Clinton “in the form of ‘thousands of emails.’ ” Mr. Papadopoulos lied about these engagements when questioned, and was caught doing so. When confronted with the prospect of jail time, he decided to cooperate. His statements constitute yet another troubling quantum of evidence that the Trump campaign may have known about and encouraged the Russian intrusion on our elections — so-called collusion.

The Papadopoulos plea was finalized this month, and it’s no coincidence that Mr. Mueller held off announcing it until today. It’s a clear signal to Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates about how they should proceed — and how much the special counsel wants them to. Mr. Manafort was privy to the inner workings of the Trump campaign, and he attended the now-famous June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner and apparent Russian emissaries. Should Mr. Manafort cooperate, he would be an important witness as to what those in attendance said about the event before, during and after — and whether Mr. Trump himself was briefed on it.

Mr. Gates, though less well known, was also intertwined with Mr. Trump, including during the administration itself. If Mr. Mueller can secure his cooperation through a plea or immunity, he too can offer a wealth of information, including what he did, who he met with and what he discussed in his White House visits. To take another example, Mr. Gates’ colleagues in a pro-Trump outside group he worked with in the first months of the administration included Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign’s digital director. Mr. Mueller would surely be interested in knowing whether Mr. Parscale ever offered any indication that he was aware of or cooperated with Russian cyber-intrusions during the campaign.

Finally, what do today’s developments tell us about the largest questions of all: whether Mr. Mueller is going to bring charges against Mr. Trump himself relating to campaign collusion with Russia, or obstruction? We can’t answer those questions yet, but the seriousness and speed of today’s indictments suggests that if there is a case to be made on either of those grounds, Mr. Mueller will make it. We believe the greatest risk to Mr. Trump remains the possibility that he obstructed justice by firing the former F.B.I. director James Comey. The fact that Mr. Mueller has found enough evidence to bring credible charges in just five months suggests that he is moving forward with determination and skill. For anyone in the path of his investigation who has committed an offense, that cannot be welcome news.

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Newspaper articles detailed the killing effects of Soviet nuclear weapons. Children learned to “duck and cover” in schools. Homeowners built shelters in basements and backyards, and the morality of private shelters accessible to privileged families became a raging national debate.

Photo

On television, “The Twilight Zone” depicted friends and neighbors in fear of an imminent nuclear attack fighting over access to one family’s shelter. A Life magazine cover featured the alarming image of a man in a “civilian fallout suit” and the headline “How You Can Survive Fallout: 97 of 100 People Can Be Saved.” The government issued a 46-page pamphlet, “Fallout Protection: What to Know and Do About Nuclear Attack.”

President John F. Kennedy’s public fallout shelter program was intended to ease the nation’s anxieties, but its very announcement terrified many Americans. “We have another sober responsibility,” the president told the nation on July 25, 1961, “to recognize the possibilities of nuclear war in the missile age, without our citizens knowing what they should do and where they should go if the bombs begin to fall.”

Photo

The program began with a nationwide survey by the Army Corps of Engineers to identify shelter sites. But signs for the public to find the sites apparently occurred to no one at the White House, the Pentagon or the Corps of Engineers. Almost as an afterthought, Maj. Gen. Keith R. Barney, the deputy chief of engineers, posed the matter to Mr. Blakeley, the director of administrative logistics support function.

In plainer language, Mr. Blakeley was one of those important but anonymous civil servants down the chain of command where the buck really stops. He had been a civilian manager for the corps for five years, in charge of administrative work for some 60 harbor, river and other military construction projects.

And in a lifetime of memorable experiences — he was a combat veteran of World War II and the Korean War, and would eventually meet Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter in the course of his duties and become president of Toastmasters International — the shelter signs seemed, as he put it, “no big deal.”

“Like so many other things in life, you solve a problem and go on to the next thing,” he said in a telephone interview for this obituary from his home in Jacksonville in 2014. “I must have just wiped it out of my mind.”

Robert Wilson Blakeley was born in Ogden, Utah, on Aug. 30, 1922, one of four children of Robert G. and Elsie Jean Wilson Blakeley. He attended public schools and Weber Junior College (now Weber State University) in Ogden, and studied for a year at Utah State University.

He joined the Marine Corps in 1943 and was a sergeant major in the Fourth Marine Division invasion of Iwo Jima in 1945, one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. He was recalled to duty in the Korean War in 1951 and 1952.

His first marriage, to Jean Brown in the 1940s, ended in divorce. In 1952 he married Dorothy McArthur. She died in 1992. Besides their daughter, Dorothy, they had a son, Robert, who died at age 36. In 2003, he married Irene Allan Davis. In addition to her and his daughter, Mr. Blakeley is survived by three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Mr. Blakeley studied landscape architecture at the University of California at Berkeley, graduating in 1954. After two years with the Veterans Administration, he joined the Army Corps of Engineers in 1956. To improve his speaking, he joined Toastmasters in 1958. He became its international president for 1976-77.

Given responsibility for the fallout shelter project, he decided that for durability, the signs would be made of metal, and that the colors and design would be simple and eye-catching, even in the dark chaos of a city under attack.

“It would have to be usable in downtown New York City, Manhattan, when all the lights are out and people are on the street and don’t know where to go,” Mr. Blakeley told Bill Geerhart, a blogger on Cold War topics, for an oral history that appeared on the website Conelrad Adjacent in 2006. The sign, he said, “had to be something that would get people’s attention and give them direction to the location.”

Photo

After experimenting with reflective paint in the basement of his Virginia home, he chose orange-yellow and black for the primary colors, and drew the sign as his children watched over his shoulder. The graphic design was suggested by Blair Inc., of Fairfax, Va., and was probably inspired by “Hornung’s Handbook of Designs and Devices,” published in 1932 and updated in 1946.

What he came up with entailed three bright, inverted equilateral triangles joined at the center on a round black background, with shelter capacity circled near the base, followed by the words “Fallout Shelter” in large block capitals and directional arrows .

The details were approved by Powell Pierpoint, special assistant to the secretary of the Army. Mr. Blakeley recommended that the Army accept bids by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, for 400,000 large exterior signs, and Alfray Products of Coshocton, Ohio, for a million smaller interior signs. The total cost was $700,000.

They were put into production, and Mr. Blakeley unveiled the first prototype (capacity 1,730) at the Westchester County Office Building in White Plains on Oct. 4, 1961. Over decades, the signs proliferated as commercial and apartment buildings joined government sites as shelters — 230,000 sites in New York City alone, civil defense officials estimated.

And as the Cuban missile crisis, the Vietnam War and the buildup of nuclear arsenals raised the stakes, the Blakeley signs became counterculture icons of the Cold War, mock symbols of apocalypse bobbing in antiwar protests, featured in films and television dramas and plastered on campaign buttons, refrigerator magnets and album covers, like Bob Dylan’s 1965 classic “Bringing It All Back Home.”

But as the Cold War passed without nuclear calamity, federal funding and interest in the shelters faded, their signs rusted and, in 1980, Mr. Blakeley retired from government service, his omens of Armageddon all but forgotten or, where they still remained on buildings, ignored.

When his children were young, he told Mr. Geerhart, “We’d go down the street, and one of the kids would say, ‘Hey, Dad, there’s one of your signs.’ But, you know, other than that it’s just like many of the other things that happen in life. It’s just one of those routine things.”","Robert Blakeley, Whose Fallout Shelter Sign Symbolized the Cold War, Dies at 95",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/obituaries/robert-blakeley-whose-fallout-shelter-sign-symbolized-the-cold-war-dies-at-95.html

Track Your Sleep

The second most useful app I have on my phone (after my food tracker) is Sleep Cycle. I turn it on when I’m about to fall asleep, and it tracks the duration and quality of my rest. Modern technology — what a world!

Of all the aspects of the quantified self I engage in, analyzing my sleep patterns is by far my favorite. In the same way a food tracker forces you to look at what you put into your body, tracking your sleep makes you realize you’re probably not getting nearly as much sleep as you should.

Of course, you can always go low-tech and keep a sleep diary — and to help you out, here is the handy NYT sleep diary you can print for all your tracking needs.

Figure Out if You’re a Morning Person

While we’re listening to our bodies, let’s be honest: Do mornings just not work for you? It’s fine if they don’t! But knowing is half the battle, and by not listening to your natural rhythms you might be trying to create certain sleep habits that simply aren’t a fit for your life.

Here’s the NYT quiz to find out whether you’re a morning person or a creature of the night.

If You’re Tired During the Day, Take a Nap

My personal favorite bit of sleep advice: If you’re tired, take a nap. Research has shown that midday naps can help improve your productivity at work and, assuming you don’t take them too late in the afternoon, they generally don’t negatively affect your sleep schedule. (And perhaps you’ve picked up on our theme here: Listen to your body!)

MANY OF US, let’s admit it, have gone to a museum or ordered dessert simply to post the experience on social media. Likewise, many interiors on Instagram seem to have been created with a future photo in mind. But these spaces frequently feel inert, overly composed; there is none of the sense of life, of organic coherence, that accrues over time in a place that’s actually been inhabited, not just arranged for a picture. Nuriev’s apartment is certainly photogenic — he has a knack for dividing spaces with color-blocking, essentially creating areas made to be framed — but it also radiates an air of imperfect coziness. That human touch is evident in the black plastic hand-shaped chair he found on the street, or the bowl of McIntosh apples that sits on his desk because their scent reminds him of growing up in Stavropol, an agricultural hub in the Caucasus. Even as his apartment serves as his showroom — “it’s not like a website where you go and see pictures,” he says. “It’s honest.”

For Nuriev, honesty — that intangible virtue — is fundamental to good design. “This sofa,” he continues, pointing to the blue sectional, which is easy to imagine as the site of drunken late-night hangouts, “it’s pure function, but it’s still beautiful.” His goal when designing a room, he says, is to “leave only what’s only useful.” He cites as his influences Japanese architecture (especially Tadao Ando and the firm Sanaa), Scandinavian design and Le Corbusier, who famously called a house a “machine for living.” These are often the references for Nuriev’s cohort of global minimalists, even if they don’t always realize it. “So many people are riffing on things they don’t know about,” says Patrick Parrish, Nuriev’s New York gallerist, nodding to the fact that young designers are bombarded by so many digital images that they often lose sight of where an idea begins. “Harry’s not like that. He knows exactly what he’s referencing.”

This style, in part, follows last decade’s midcentury modern craze, though softens those hard edges, making a space more inviting. It’s also an outgrowth of market forces: The popularity of midcentury furniture rendered the classics too costly for young designers, who were forced to look for more obscure vintage inspiration. Of course, it takes a new generation of designers to see old decades with fresh eyes: Often, they’ve been exposed to only its most superlative examples, and only in magazines and books, as opposed to, say, their Great-aunt Marg’s apartment. And then there’s the fact that simpler forms, like the arch, don’t require the craftsmanship of more complicated designs.

Nuriev, who had six years of training at the Moscow Architectural Institute, says he was first drawn to the arch because “it was very classic — Roman, Italian, Greek,” and he wanted to figure out how to “use it in real life, to make it sexy.” He says that when he first started using them, back in 2014, “it looked weird.” The pink, likewise, “looked girlish,” and people would ask him why he was using it. “It’s not that everybody copied me,” he says. “It’s just that I sensed something.”

What’s difficult to spot are references to Nuriev’s Russian upbringing, but they’re in fact there, if quietly. On the back wall of the kitchen hangs a blue-framed poster of Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet-Korean singer popular in the 1980s whom Nuriev calls “the Patti Smith of Russia.” Above the sofa, he’s taped a small pamphlet, depicting the reformer Sergius of Radonezh, from his neighborhood’s Russian Orthodox Church: “In Russia,” he says, “it’s as customary to hang a gilt-framed icon in the house as it is to hang a painting over the sofa in American homes.” His version glances at both traditions, while adhering to neither.",The Man Designing Spaces for the Instagram Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/t-magazine/design/harry-nuriev.html

AFTER THE ECLIPSE

A Mother’s Murder, a Daughter’s Search

By Sarah Perry

350 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $27.

In the early morning of May 12, 1994, in a small inland town in Maine, Sarah Perry’s 30-year-old mother, Crystal, was stabbed to death in her home, while Sarah, who was 12 at the time and lived alone with her mother, sat frozen on her bed on the other side of a thin wall. The murder, which went unsolved for 12 years, marked Perry, infecting her with a “viscous blackness” unleashed by the killer’s act. Like the partial solar eclipse Perry and her mother witnessed two nights before the murder, this blackness blotted out the daughter’s and the mother’s former selves. “After the Eclipse” is Perry’s effort to look behind this shadow. But it also reveals much more: a town plagued by violence, addiction and generational poverty; a culture of women taught to need men who were often ill equipped to love them; and the courage and compassion required to not merely survive the worst thing imaginable but to make a kind of terrible sense of it.

“A violent act is an epicenter; it shakes everyone within reach and creates other stories, cracks open the earth and reveals buried secrets. I want those stories, those secrets.” So Perry explains her decision five years after the conviction of her mother’s murderer to search through the extensive police files gathered during the investigation. There she finds “ardent letters” between her mother and the college-student boyfriend who spun her in and out like a yo-yo, and rumors of the men who shared her mother’s bed and the ones who wanted to. There is the calendar from their kitchen wall documenting movies seen and hikes taken, and the underwear her mother wore that night, purchased oversize in “a funny sort of modesty.” Perry learns of an investigator’s suspicions of her — “Mother may have been an embarrassment to her. She may have wished it happened” — and the assessment of a social worker after meeting her family the morning after the murder: “They were all losers.” To this, Perry adds dozens of her own interviews, the extensive news coverage, her personal archives and those of her family and friends, along with her memories to complete this entirely different but equally pressing investigation.

“After the Eclipse” pulls the reader swiftly along on parallel tracks of mystery and elegy. Early on, Perry dispels any question of whether her mother hastened her own death through her choices in men or her behavior, but she withholds who actually killed her mother until almost the end. The chapters alternate between Perry’s mother’s life — beginning with a childhood characterized by neglect, alcoholism and violence and her escape at 15 into a marriage to Perry’s father that brought more of the same — and Perry’s own life after her mother’s death, as she struggles to be a “normal kid” in a series of loveless homes amid an ongoing murder investigation that treats her as both suspect and potential next victim.

It’s a rhythm that builds suspense, which in other hands might feel prurient, but Perry’s scrupulous research and painstaking rendering of her experiences make her a trustworthy guide through such emotionally charged terrain. She’s also a wonderful writer with an assured sense of when to zoom in to her body’s somatic response for a piercing immediacy and when to pull back to convey the measured perspective gained through the distance of time. Many moments of beauty and tenderness rise up through the darkness.

In the end, Perry succeeds in restoring her mother’s humanity, and her own. Crystal Perry was a hard worker who saved enough money from her job sewing the topstitching onto leather moccasins at a local factory to purchase a car and home and provide for her child. She was a free-spirited, redheaded beauty prone to “car dancing” and hot-tempered men who couldn’t give her the love she sought. She was a creative, energetic and loving mother who raised a very talented and remarkable daughter.","In ‘After the Eclipse,’ a Daughter Mourns Her Murdered Mother",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/books/review/after-the-eclipse-sarah-perry-memoir-tribute.html

Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity — not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: “Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood? I could be the size of Marlon Brando in ‘Apocalypse Now,’ who’s going to know?”

You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with “Star Wars,” which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal. The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.

But Mr. Hamill isn’t bitter or jaded, and he isn’t Luke, though he has retained some of that character’s incorruptibility. He’s gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing “Star Wars” war stories.

At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought “Star Wars” into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.

“I’m such a fraud,” he said with a theatrical air. “But I’m enjoying all the residual attention that the movie’s getting. I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn. What’s not to love?”

On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin. The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to “Star Wars” — it’s mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamill’s own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of “Return of the Jedi.”

Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up. In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; he’ll slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues — the adenoidal clip of the “Star Wars” creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.

In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was “King Kong.”

Proudly recalling a fight scene from “Return of the Jedi,” Mr. Hamill said, “For me, sitting in the rancor’s hand, I was going all Fay Wray — it’s like a major accomplishment to me. But it was always that way. I’d say ‘Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3PO’s cereal!’”

The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings. He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.

When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could. “If I didn’t get a part, no problem,” he said. “Then where do I go? I sell tickets. I make props. I make posters. I don’t have to be in the show – I want to be near the show.”

He landed early roles on “General Hospital” and “The Partridge Family.” And then, of course, came “Star Wars”: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.

Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects. “I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity,” Mr. Lucas said. He added that Mr. Hamill “brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character,” and that “made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first ‘Star Wars.’”

Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience. “I thought, even if this thing doesn’t slay at the box office, it’s got midnight cult movie written all over it,” he said. “Move over, ‘Rocky Horror,’ ‘Star Wars’ is here!”

Instead, “Star Wars” became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford — even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them “Harry and Carrison” — as they promoted the movie together.

When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed “adequately,” Mr. Hamill “uninspiredly” and Ms. Fisher “wretchedly,” Mr. Hamill said, “We had T-shirts made: ‘adequate, uninspired and wretched.’ I said, ‘Harrison, adequate’s practically a rave compared to what we got.’”

Mr. Ford said that during this time, “the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness. We really were figuring this out as we went along.” Mr. Hamill struck him as “a very bright, sincere young actor,” who Mr. Ford said “seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.”

Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the “Star Wars” royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now. Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: “He’s a brilliant actor — that’s a given,” he said. “He’s also a leading man. When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.” Mr. Hamill believed he’d find his destiny on a different path — one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.

After two blockbuster sequels, “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980 and “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the “Star Wars” story was complete. With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in “The Elephant Man.” “I wasn’t getting character parts in movies and television,” he explained. “Unless you’re Meryl Streep, they don’t let you do accents.”

He starred in the Broadway production of “Amadeus” while “Return of the Jedi” was still in theaters. But his 1985 musical “Harrigan ’n Hart,” about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.

Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his “Star Wars” legacy. He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on “The Simpsons,” he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of “Guys and Dolls.” Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.

He was always comfortable being part of the “Star Wars” subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for “ultra-passionate fans”).

“It’s clearly not for everyone — I get that,” Mr. Hamill said. “But the passion of it all is just astonishing. The way it’s become part of the fabric of their lives — ‘I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia’ — it’s moving.”

He was not involved in the much-maligned “Star Wars” prequels from 1999 to 2005. And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new “Star Wars” trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate. “We figured we had the middle three,” he said. “It was over.”

When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, “I was completely stunned. Carrie, not a minute went by — she slapped the table and goes, ‘I’m in!’ I said, ‘Carrie, poker face!’”

Mr. Hamill needed more time to think. “I was just really scared,” he said. “I thought, why mess with it? The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.”

He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their “Star Wars” heyday. “No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star,” he said. “It’s sad.”

Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse “The Force Awakens,” expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.

“He’s too old and too rich and too cranky,” Mr. Hamill said. “He’s not going to do this.” But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: “Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no? I’d be the most hated man in nerd-dom.”

Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of “Star Wars” fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists. But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of “The Force Awakens,” and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Luke’s story line. (The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)

“The idea of it was so enormous,” Mr. Abrams said. “It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters. That had to be the next movie.”

Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in “The Force Awakens.” “I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal,” Mr. Abrams said. “I don’t think he knew just how minimal until he read it.”

In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was “not particularly happy with how little he was in it.”

Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Luke’s big reveal at the end would fall flat. “If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if there’s a big groan in the house, the egg’s on my face, not J.J.’s,” he said.

Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read — he jokingly calls it a “table listen” — of the “Force Awakens” script. He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration. (“I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse,” Mr. Hamill said.) Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.

Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in “The Force Awakens,” lamented that they had worked together on the early “Star Wars” movies far less than viewers realize.

“The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few,” he said. “I knew Chewbacca better.”

Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, “aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.”

“He’s very centered in his own experience and his own life,” Mr. Ford said. “He’s not a grandstander. He’s a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and that’s what we’re there for.”

Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in “The Force Awakens” — “when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, that’s fabulous,” he said.

But now he and the “The Last Jedi” creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.

“I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this,” said Rian Johnson, the “Last Jedi” writer and director. “Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.”

Mr. Johnson said “The Last Jedi” also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke. “In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with — the youthfulness and innocence — he now embodies a person full of soul and experience,” Mr. Johnson said.

While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the “Star Wars” filmmakers on big plot points — he’s still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister — he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in “The Last Jedi.”

“That’s the hard part,” Mr. Hamill said. “You don’t want to admit how possessive you’ve become. There are times where you go, ‘Really? That’s what they think of Luke? I’m not only in disagreement – I’m insulted.’ But that’s the process and you thrash it all out.”

The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December. Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent — someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to “Star Wars.”

Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his “Star Wars” work, he said, “She goes, ‘What’s your problem?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.’ She goes, ‘I am Princess Leia. You’re Luke Skywalker. Get used to it.’”

More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.

“She deserved that second act,” he said. “Harrison was more prominent in VII, I’m more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one. Her timing was perfect, except in this case.”

His “Star Wars” colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise — “He’s the last man standing,” said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in “The Force Awakens.”

But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.

“It means what it means to him, and that’s all that matters,” he said. “I’m sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and” — his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone — “that it’s all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.”

Photo

Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either. Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original “Star Wars” movies outside of theaters and has seen “The Force Awakens” only twice.

“All I notice are flaws,” he explained. “‘Oh, why did I do that?’ ‘Look at my hair.’ ‘What was I thinking?’”

During production of “The Force Awakens,” he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker — Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt — and was struck by what he saw. “They were all great,” Mr. Hamill said. “They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.”

One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is “A Hard Day’s Night,” Richard Lester’s madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.

As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, “I saw it originally going, ‘Oh, can you imagine it? Girls chasing me down the street! It looks like so much fun.’” But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light. “It’s like a horror movie,” he said. “They’re trapped. They can’t go anywhere.”

One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamill’s mind was the “Can’t Buy Me Love” sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.

“It’s the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy,” Mr. Hamill said. “It plays so differently now, when you’re on the other end of it.”",Luke Skywalker Speaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-mark-hamill.html

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

The ambush drew widespread public criticism of the government’s campaign against Islamist violence and the performance of Egypt’s security agencies. In the days after the attack, Egyptian officials vehemently denied news reports that suggested a lack of coordination between agencies and an intelligence failure were partly to blame for the losses.

Mr. Sisi’s campaign against armed Islamist groups began in July 2013, shortly after he, as military chief at the time, ousted Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist president, amid mass protests.

The group has broadened its campaign this year to include Egypt’s Coptic Christian minority, attacking churches, Christian homes and pilgrims across the country.

Several young officers said the attack lowered morale, and some accused the Interior Ministry of failing to provide their slain colleagues with sufficient backup.

“We can say that this shake-up was principally conducted to placate the public and certain segments inside the police,” said Ahmed Kamel El-Beheiri, a security researcher at the state-run Al-Ahram Center for Strategic Studies. “The fact that the move includes the military chief of staff means that they are also trying to overhaul their strategy against terrorism because of all the recent attacks.”

Egyptian security officials told several news outlets, including The New York Times, that the ambush attack killed over 50 policemen, but the Egyptian Interior Ministry insisted that only 16 died. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity fearing reprisals. The conflicting figures given could not be reconciled.

Several local news websites and social media users published some of the names of the killed policemen. The posts could not be independently verified, but at least 12 of the reported names were not on the official list of victims.

The slain officers were on their way to attack what was believed to be a militant hide-out in the desert, acting on a faulty intelligence tip, the officials said. As they neared their destination, militants raked the police convoy with rockets and gunfire.

Hasm, a small Islamist group that emerged last year, claimed responsibility for the attack, which was the deadliest in years to target the police. But militancy experts questioned the claim’s authenticity and said the attack was most likely carried out by Islamic State militants because it involved the use of heavy weapons and its location.

The western desert has long been home to smugglers and militants of all stripes. It also links Egypt to neighboring Libya, a lawless country that is hosting a variety of armed Islamist groups, including Islamic State fighters.

There was, however, no other claim of responsibility from the Islamic State or other groups.",Egypt Shakes Up Security Forces After Deadly Ambush of Police,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/world/middleeast/egypt-abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html

Well, Michael Moore succeeded in getting the president’s attention.

On Saturday evening, six days after “The Terms of My Surrender,” Mr. Moore’s solo show decrying President Trump, closed on Broadway, the president took a gleeful jab at the liberal provocateur on Twitter.

Mr. Trump’s assertion that the show “was forced to close” is incorrect. The show had been announced in May as a 12-week limited run, and it ran the full 12 weeks.

“Michael Moore’s Broadway show was always meant to be a limited engagement,” said Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the show. “It closed, as planned, on Sunday, Oct. 22. It was not forced to close early.”

Mr. Trump’s assertion that the show was “a total bomb” is a matter of opinion, and in a barrage of tweets late Saturday, Mr. Moore declared his show a “smash hit” before touting his production and taunting the president.

Given the show’s limited run and modest grosses, neither the phrase “total bomb” nor “smash hit” seems to be a precise description of its financial performance. The capitalization costs are not public for “The Terms of My Surrender,” which was produced by IMG Original Content and Carole Shorenstein Hays. But it played to houses that were often about three-quarters full, and its weekly grosses ranged from about $260,000 to $460,000. It took in $4.2 million over all and was seen by 74,484 people, according to the Broadway League.",Donald Trump and Michael Moore Quarrel Over Broadway Show,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/theater/michael-moore-trump-broadway.html

“With MaineCare I believe I’d be able to find a provider who would see me,” she said, referring to the state’s Medicaid program. “But a lot of people here don’t vote. So many families here are having addiction problems with their loved ones, and they’re not focused on going to vote — even though those are the people that need it the most.”

Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government picked up the entire cost of new enrollees under Medicaid expansion for the first three years and will continue to pay at least 90 percent. (States cover a significantly larger portion of the expenses of the regular Medicaid program.) The law allows any citizen with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level — $16,642 for an individual, $24,600 for a family of four — to qualify.

The main arguments for expanding the program here are that it would help financially fragile rural hospitals, create jobs and provide care for vulnerable people who have long gone without it.

But Mr. LePage and other opponents say that Maine should know better. The state undertook a more modest expansion of Medicaid in 2002, under former Gov. Angus King, an independent. Afterward, Maine struggled with budget shortfalls and fell behind on Medicaid payments to hospitals.

“People don’t want to acknowledge the unintended consequences that Maine has already experienced,” said Brent Littlefield, a political adviser to Mr. LePage who is serving as the spokesman for Welfare to Work, the committee leading the opposition. He said that even with the federal government paying most of the cost — a situation that could change if Congress eventually succeeds in repealing Obamacare — the state could owe close to $100 million a year, according to estimates from the LePage administration.

The Office of Program and Fiscal Review has estimated a lower state cost, about $54 million a year once the federal share drops to 90 percent in 2021. Maine would not receive the full 90 percent match for parents of young children because many already qualify for the program.

Maine’s legislature, which is controlled by Democrats in the House and Republicans, by one vote, in the Senate, could move to block the referendum if it were to pass, but since it voted for Medicaid expansion five times already, supporters and opponents alike believe it is unlikely to meddle. And the governor would have no authority to veto the outcome.

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

The trial of Mr. Madsen is expected to begin in March. He has also been preliminarily charged with abuse of a corpse and “sexual relations under aggravating circumstances.”

During a court hearing in September, the prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen said the police had found a hard drive belonging to Mr. Madsen with videos showing the torture and killing of women. The videos did not appear to have been made by the inventor, Mr. Buch-Jepsen said.

“The videos indicate that one may have an interest in fetish, torture and murder,” he said in court. “These are some very grave videos with women recorded abroad.”

“Manafort used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States without paying taxes on that income,” the indictment reads.

Mr. Gates is accused of transferring more than $3 million from offshore accounts. The two are also charged with making false statements.

“As part of the scheme, Manafort and Gates repeatedly provided false information to financial bookkeepers, tax accountants and legal counsel, among others,” the indictment read.

Mr. Papadopoulos admitted that in a January interview with the F.B.I., he lied about his contacts with a Russian professor, whom he knew to have “substantial connections to Russian government officials,” according to court documents. Mr. Papadopoulos told the authorities that the conversation occurred before he became an adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign. In fact, he met the professor days after joining the campaign.

The professor took interest in Mr. Papadopoulos “because of his status with the campaign,” the court documents said.

Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates surrendered to the F.B.I. early on Monday and, through their lawyers, pleaded not guilty to all charges on Monday. The two men, wearing dark blue suits, entered the courtroom with their hands held behind their backs. Money laundering, the most serious of the charges, carries a potential prison sentence of up to 20 years.

Mr. Manafort has expected charges since this summer, when F.B.I. agents raided his home and prosecutors warned him that they planned to indict him. That warning raised speculation that Mr. Manafort might try to cut a deal to avoid prosecution. A senior White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, said last week that the president was confident that Mr. Manafort had no damaging information about him.

People close to Mr. Manafort, including his former business partner Roger J. Stone Jr., have said he had nothing to offer that would help prosecutors build a case against Mr. Trump.

“He’s not going to lie,” Mr. Stone said in September.

Mr. Gates is a longtime protégé and junior partner of Mr. Manafort. His name appears on documents linked to companies that Mr. Manafort’s firm set up in Cyprus to receive payments from politicians and businesspeople in Eastern Europe, records reviewed by The New York Times show.

Attempts to reach Mr. Gates on Monday were not successful. A spokesman for Mr. Manafort did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican strategist, joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 to help keep delegates from breaking with Mr. Trump in favor of establishment Republican candidates. Mr. Trump soon promoted him to chairman and chief strategist, a job that gave him control over day-to-day operations of the campaign.

But Mr. Trump fired Mr. Manafort just months later, after reports that he received more than $12 million in undisclosed payments from Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president and a pro-Russia politician. Mr. Manafort spent years as a political consultant for Mr. Yanukovych.

American intelligence agencies have concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia launched a stealth campaign of hacking and propaganda to try to damage Hillary Clinton and help Mr. Trump win the election. The Justice Department appointed Mr. Mueller III as special counsel in May to lead the investigation into the Russian operations and to determine whether anyone around Mr. Trump was involved.

Mr. Trump has denied any such collusion, and no evidence has surfaced publicly to contradict him. At the same time, Mr. Trump and his advisers this year repeatedly denied any contacts with Russians during the campaign, only to have journalists uncover one undisclosed meeting after another.

The New York Times revealed in July that Mr. Manafort and others close to Mr. Trump met with Russians last year, on the promise of receiving damaging political information about Mrs. Clinton.","Paul Manafort, Ex-Chairman of Trump Campaign, and Associate Plead Not Guilty to Money Laundering",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort-indicted.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

A Supreme Court argument about making sure that death row inmates have adequate resources to challenge their sentences took a semantic turn on Monday, with the justices trying to make sense of the differences between two similar phrases.

On the one hand, a federal law says that death row inmates are entitled to money for investigators and experts if judges find it “reasonably necessary” for their defense. On the other hand, the federal appeals court in New Orleans, which oversees cases from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, says there must a “substantial need” for the money.

The appeals court denied funds to a Texas inmate, Carlos Manuel Ayestas. He challenged the denial, saying the court had set the bar too high.

But Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the two phrases meant the same thing.

“What is the difference between ‘reasonably necessary’ and ‘substantial need’?” he asked. “I have been racking my brain trying to think of something that it is reasonably necessary for me to obtain but as to which I do not have the substantial need. And I can’t think of an example.”

Several of the court’s more liberal justices disagreed, saying that “reasonably necessary” connoted matters that a reasonable lawyer with finite resources would try to pursue. The caveat about “finite resources,” Justice Elena Kagan explained, was “just to make sure that, like a reasonable attorney for Bill Gates, would scour the earth and not care about it.”",Supreme Court Delves Into Semantics of English in a Capital Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/supreme-court-delves-into-semantics-of-english-in-a-capital-case.html

Mr. Hackett has reorganized his management team with an eye toward incremental improvements in the more mundane aspects of the business, such as cutting material costs and streamlining production, as a prelude to making larger investments in electric-powered models driven by computers. It also announced a long list of senior management appointments and departures this week.

“We are committed to transforming our business,” Mr. Hackett said of his company’s efforts to bring new driverless technology to market. Yet he seemed most proud on Thursday that Ford had achieved 8 percent operating margins on vehicles it builds and sells in the North American market.

That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.

It was just eight years ago that both G.M. and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.

For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid — but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.

Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies. The Chrysler half of the Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler has gone a step further by dropping most small and midsize passenger cars from its lineup.

Its focus on Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups helped Fiat Chrysler post record third-quarter earnings of about $1.1 billion, an increase of 50 percent over the same period a year ago.

The results drew praise from one analyst because of the company’s aggressive approach to maximizing shareholder value. “Fiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldn’t make money,” the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.

The earnings announcements this week were welcomed on Wall Street, with Ford’s shares gaining almost 2 percent on Thursday.

But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.

Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years. An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement — which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico — could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.

Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V. lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.

Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.

Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nation’s largest automaker. The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe. Moreover, G.M. slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.

The company reported a loss of $3 billion for the quarter, mostly because it is still absorbing hefty charges for the sale of the European assets to the French carmaker PSA Group. But G.M. reported 8 percent profit margins on vehicles it did sell in its home market, and pledged to stay focused on selling fewer, but higher-priced, vehicles.

G.M.’s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated “the resilience of our core business” in the face of declining consumer demand. “This was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes,” he said.

But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models. “The market is more challenging than expected,” Mr. Stevens said.

Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars. G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.

The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruise’s work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment. And G.M. is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.

Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States. “Absolutely, we are going to be looking globally,” she said.

And even Fiat Chrysler, which has been slow to join the race to develop autonomous vehicles, served notice that it was now in position to accelerate its self-driving program in partnership with the German automaker BMW and suppliers like Delphi and Intel.

On Twitter, Mr. Trump reacted only to the indictment of Mr. Manafort on tax fraud, money laundering and foreign lobbying violations, arguing that it was not relevant to the campaign since it dealt with prior private business.

In the first of two tweets, Mr. Trump wrote: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”

In a second tweet minutes later, Mr. Trump added: “....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”

He made no comment on the guilty plea by Mr. Papadopoulous, who admitted lying to the F.B.I. about his efforts to connect Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russian government officials.

At her briefing, Ms. Sanders repeatedly insisted that Mr. Papadopolous was just “a volunteer” in the president’s campaign, and she downplayed his role by saying that he was “a volunteer member of an advisory council that literally met one time.”

Ms. Sanders insisted that Trump campaign officials rebuffed all of his efforts to put them in touch with Russians. “You mean the outreach that was repeatedly denied, and pushed away?” she said. “He reached out and nothing happened beyond that.”

His guilty plea, she said, was unrelated to his campaign efforts. “It has nothing to do with the activities of the campaign,” Ms. Sanders said. “It has to do with his failure to tell the truth that doesn’t have anything to do with the campaign or the campaign’s activities.”

Democrats jumped on the indictments, showing no hesitation to link the allegations against Trump campaign aides to Mr. Trump himself.

“We know today that the Trump presidential campaign was run by a Russian foreign agent now charged with conspiring against the United States,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. “This indictment is a sober, shattering moment and a major step toward answers and accountability for the American people. The President now owes the American people a serious explanation of his decision to hire Manafort and his own knowledge of this conspiracy.”

Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, keyed in Mr. Papadopoulis, who “pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. investigators about his contacts with a Russian individual with ‘substantial connections’ with Russian government officials who discussed possessing ‘dirt’ on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.”

“These indictments and guilty plea demonstrate beyond any doubt that this is a consequential investigation, and it must be allowed to move forward without political interference,” he said in a statement.

Ms. Sanders said that Mr. Manafort and the president have not spoken in months. She said that Mr. Gates had been at the White House several times since the inauguration, but she declined to say for certain whether Mr. Trump had spoken to Mr. Gates.

“I know that there was some initial contact after the president was sworn in,” she said, but said that she was not certain there was anything “directly with the president.”

Both Ms. Sanders and Mr. Sekulow disputed suggestions that Mr. Trump might seek to fire Mr. Mueller. “There’s no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel,” Ms. Sanders said.

The two also played down the possibility that Mr. Trump might pardon Mr. Manafort or others caught in the special counsel’s investigation. “I haven’t had a conversation with the president about pardons or pardoning individuals,” said Mr. Sekulow. Ms. Sanders likewise said that she had not spoken with the president about the possibility of pardons.

The president’s team again pointed to the Democrats to argue that they were the ones who were collaborating with Russia because of a salacious dossier of allegations against Mr. Trump produced by a firm called Fusion GPS that was paid in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

LOS ANGELES — George Clooney served up a comedic drama that gave Paramount Pictures the worst wide-release opening total in its history. Steven Spielberg’s production company delivered a military drama that went widely ignored. The Weinstein Company offloaded a horror movie in very limited release and took in a grand total of $742.

Put simply: Hollywood had another horrific weekend at the box office.

The No. 1 movie was “Jigsaw,” the eighth installment in the “Saw” horror series. It took in about $16.3 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data, tying “Saw VI” for the lowest opening in the franchise, after adjusting for inflation. Analysts had anticipated ticket sales of roughly $20 million for “Jigsaw,” which received poor reviews.

Lionsgate, which spent a modest $10 million to make “Jigsaw,” also had the No. 2 movie. “Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween” collected an estimated $10 million, for a two-week total of $35.5 million.

According to comScore, domestic ticket sales for October totaled $539 million, a 13 percent decline from the same month last year, when dramas like “The Accountant” and “The Girl on the Train” got turnstiles clicking. Explanations for the downturn include the escalating popularity of streaming services — “Stranger Things 2” arrived on Netflix on Friday — and subpar offerings from Hollywood; Mr. Clooney’s film, “Suburbicon,” received a D-minus grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls.

Another point worth pondering is how it is that President Trump chose as his campaign chair someone like Manafort whose reputation in the political world was less about his political brilliance than about his ties to Russia and Ukraine (including some of the most corrupt people there) and his general shadiness. It’s said that Jared Kushner was among those advocating to hire Manafort, so the obvious question is: Why?

Maybe there simply wasn’t adequate vetting, even though news organizations quickly found problems that led to Manafort’s firing. But the inclination to hire someone so close to Moscow does raise questions about the Trump inner circle’s predilection to hire someone linked to Russia and Ukraine.

We’re still not sure whether there was collusion between President Trump and Russia, but we certainly do know that Russia interfered with the U.S. election and may even have affected the outcome, although that is impossible to know for sure. Nothing could be more serious, or more deserving of careful investigation.

President Trump tweeted this morning that there was “no collusion” and again urged greater focus on the supposed crimes of Hillary Clinton. By that he presumably means the uranium deal, which has conservatives in a frenzy—but it is simply absurd to think that there is some parallel.

Look, it was The Times that in 2015 helped uncover and publicize the uranium arrangement, but it has been flagrantly taken out of context by Fox News and its ilk. For starters, there seems to be a suspicion on the right that American uranium is going to Russia, while in fact there’s no export license—so the uranium stays in America. More important, this was a non-controversial deal that an interagency committee approved, apparently unanimously, at a level far below Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Every bit of evidence says that Clinton never even weighed in on it. So the notion that this is somehow a serious scandal parallel to Moscow’s work to overturn an American presidential election is just comical.

One peril ahead is that President Trump may engage in riskier or more aggressive behavior vis-à-vis North Korea so that people will rally around the flag. Another is that Trump will fire Mueller. This would be difficult for him to do, because (opinions vary) he might have to do this through the Justice Department framework, leading to another Archibald Cox-style massacre of reluctant intermediaries. But it would also be a body blow to the rule of law in America, and it would trigger a Constitutional crisis.

Any firing of Mueller would lead many fair-minded people to assume that Trump is hiding criminal behavior, perhaps treason. There would be a push for impeachment, a boost to Congressional investigations, and the presidency would be hobbled—along with the United States itself—for years to come. Trump set in motion today’s actions when he fired James Comey, and I hope he understands that firing Mueller would probably also set in motion the complete unraveling of his presidency.",Will Manafort Sing?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/paul-manafort-indictment-trump.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The Cabaret Law was enacted in 1926. It made it illegal to host “musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement” without a license. The law is widely believed to have originally been used to target racially mixed jazz clubs in Harlem, but it was broadly applied. Music was not permitted at unlicensed bars at all until 1936, when the law was amended to allow radio- and piano-playing. The same year, operators of a ship that had taken men from the Bowery Mission on a day cruise were fined for running an unlicensed cabaret because a tap dancer was on board.

From 1940 to 1967, the city required performers and employees of cabarets to be fingerprinted and carry “cabaret cards,” which could be denied if the applicant had a police record. The star-studded list of musicians who were denied cards or had them revoked includes Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker. “Billie Holiday could not get a club date for many years before her death because she had a narcotics record. Ray Charles the blind blues singer cannot work here for the same reason,” an article in The Times noted in 1966. Frank Sinatra refused to sing in New York for years rather than submit to the indignity of the required fingerprinting.

Around the same time, Greenwich Village coffeehouses were fined for operating as unlicensed cabarets after hosting musicians. Clubs were shut down if they violated a so-called three-musician rule, which, until it was challenged by Mr. Chevigny in the late 1980s, permitted unlicensed venues to host no more than three musicians, who, for a long time, were also barred from playing wind and percussion instruments.

In the 1990s, under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city revived the Cabaret Law, using it to shut down dance clubs as part of its quality-of-life initiatives. As rave culture bloomed around the world, New Yorkers learned their city had a no-dancing law, sometimes only when a task force — known as March, for Multi Agency Response to Community Hotspots — swooped in.

Mayor de Blasio’s administration has issued relatively few citations, but Mr. Espinal said he found a groundswell of support for a repeal in Bushwick this year. At a town-hall meeting about night life initiatives at Market Hotel this spring, advocates immediately steered the conversation toward the Cabaret Law. “We came in sort of as a flash mob,” said John Barclay, who runs Bossa Nova Civic Club in Bushwick, which does not have a cabaret license.

Andrew Muchmore, a lawyer and bar owner, filed a still-pending lawsuit against the city after his bar, Muchmore’s, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was slapped with a cabaret violation in 2013 by a police officer who spotted people “swaying” at a rock show while investigating a noise complaint, Mr. Muchmore said. His legal argument focused on how the law limits the type of music venues can feature, infringing freedom of expression, and a decision by the judge early in the case indicated a possibility that the law could be invalidated on First Amendment grounds.

“We couldn’t have entire genres — Latin music of any kind, electronic. We had to censor our music to make sure no one danced,” he said.

Opponents of the law have also emphasized its ultimate effect. “When we stop people from dancing, they go straight to these warehouses,” Mr. Barclay said, recalling a recent deadly fire in the Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland, Calif. “People haven’t stopped dancing, they’re just dancing in these extremely unsafe, unregulated environments.”","After 91 Years, New York Will Let Its People Boogie",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/new-york-cabaret-law-repeal.html

Claim to Fame: A multihyphenate artist and social ringleader, Ms. Escobar is the latest in a glamorous line of Warhol-like ambassadors to downtown New York’s nexus of art and night life. Her subversive practice includes retouching Alexander Hamilton’s face on a $10 bill and found-object pieces like “used makeup wipes from nights spent with a former lover,” she said. She is also a D.J. and host of Glam, a monthly party at China Chalet on lower Broadway. “Even though it’s a mixed crowd, we are queer people doing a queer party,” said Ms. Escobar, who is transgender. “Glam is a safe space for sisters to come together.”

Big Break: Although she moved to New York in 2010 to pursue fashion, she soon soured on the industry and “started dabbling in night life a little bit to pay my rent.” Recent gigs include fashion week parties for Diane von Furstenberg and the makeup artist Pat McGrath, and the opening party for the Whitney Biennial. Her late-night credentials have boosted her art-world profile. She was part of a group video show at the Artists Space gallery last year, and starred in a surrealist food-styling cooking show for Dis Magazine.

Strauss’s subtle lie is that a wise aging woman will naturally make a staggeringly inappropriate erotic choice, jettisoning the search for love in a desperate burst of sexual eagerness.
The lie is that it is only in this form — where the aging woman makes a terrible choice, and then comes to her senses and renounces that choice — that an audience will accept the representation of the sex life and emotions of an aging woman.
Aging love always has baggage.
For Antony and Cleopatra, love is comic because of its bodily and temporal particularity.","And yet. The first lie of Strauss and his librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal — the one I will call “the obvious lie” — concerns inevitability. For women, according to the opera, getting old means surrender and renunciation. The Marschallin’s life, as she ages, must end up as sexless as the convent girl’s life from which it emerged. Audiences typically swallow the lie and applaud her sage retreat. Strauss plays a double game: He gains a reputation for daring by broaching the unusual theme, and yet he comforts his audience by saying something utterly conventional about it.

Now, however, we come to a more subtle lie. Why do audiences accept the inevitability of the Marschallin’s resignation? Consider her erotic choice. This is a woman who was taken from the convent into a loveless marriage, with a husband who is off hunting throughout the entire opera and doesn’t even bother to put in an appearance. So, if the Marschallin really is the wise woman she is supposed to be, what might she look for in a lover? Sex certainly, but that is not the exclusive offering of teenage boys. She would very likely also be looking for conversation, for humor and for real personal love. Instead, she turns to a boy who is no more than 17. She seeks a relationship that is based entirely on his infatuated sexual eagerness; it offers absolutely no possibilities of conversation or genuine personal intimacy, since Octavian, so far as we are allowed to know him, is a very stupid teenager, albeit with pretty manners.

The 18th-century Vienna in which the opera takes place surely contained many men of greater interest, many of them interested in love affairs with married women, since the world the opera depicts is permissive. So what has this wise woman with what one critic calls “acute sensibilities” and “profound understanding” done? Out of all the men around, she has chosen one who is interested in sex alone, who has no capacity for intelligent conversation, and who has no interest at all in her as a person, except as a sex teacher. Why did she make this choice? No plausible motive is suggested. And this absence of motive, particularly in one so wise, creates the lie: the implicit explanation is that this is the only option she has.

This “choice,” of course, explains why the demise of the relationship is felt as inevitable. There’s nothing to sustain it, and so Octavian may as well do as society expects and go marry the rich heiress, his fiancée, Sophie, to whom he has nothing interesting to say either. Soon it will be him off hunting in the countryside, and Sophie will be alone, living out the “inevitable” in her own generation.

The mismatch, of course, has nothing to do with age difference per se (as most commentators oddly suggest that it does). The inappropriateness concerns the fact that Octavian (besides being stupid) is much too young for a mature relationship.

So here’s the subtle lie: a lonely aging woman, in an unhappy marriage, described as beautiful, cannot find an interesting lover. All she can find is a hormonal boy who would sleep with anyone, and she takes what she can get. Strauss’s subtle lie is that a wise aging woman will naturally make a staggeringly inappropriate erotic choice, jettisoning the search for love in a desperate burst of sexual eagerness. And then, being wise, she will give that up and become resigned to a sexless life — apparently because no male not totally preoccupied with teenage hormonal excess will look in her direction. That’s not just a lie, it’s a generative lie, since when people come to believe it, it informs life.

Now we arrive at a third lie, the subtlest of all. The lie is that it is only in this form — where the aging woman makes a terrible choice, and then comes to her senses and renounces that choice — that an audience will accept the representation of the sex life and emotions of an aging woman. In other words, the aging woman has to be punished — and doubly punished, first by being thrust into a stupid and shallow relationship, and then by being made to give it up with high-minded talk about time and inevitability. It is very like the old days in which gay male relationships in fiction had to end with a death. Audiences wanted to punish gay men; they disapproved, and wanted novelists to register that disapproval. Audiences then and now want to punish the aging woman, and thus, aided by Strauss, they construct an aesthetic fiction of the “inevitability” of her renunciation and the “profound wisdom” of her acceptance.

Is this third lie, however, a lie? Is it really possible, audiences being what they are, to represent the sexual/romantic choices of an aging woman attractively, showing her making a good and interesting choice, and then being happy in that choice? To see that the answer to this question is “yes,” we need only turn to Shakespeare, and “Antony and Cleopatra” (1606). Of course, Shakespeare had history at his back, and Cleopatra is one of history’s most fascinating women. Her love affair with Antony was real, and lasted until death. Shakespeare had lived by then through the remarkable reign of a female monarch, Elizabeth, who died in 1603, and who was believed by many to have had a longtime lover; so he knew he could carry his audience with such a tale.

Unlike the dreamy abstractions of the youthful love in “Romeo and Juliet,” “Antony and Cleopatra” depicts what we might call mature love — love between people who enjoy being grown-ups together and who have no desire to transcend human life, because they are having too much fun in life as it is.

Romeo and Juliet don’t eat; Antony and Cleopatra eat all the time. Romeo and Juliet have no occupation; Antony and Cleopatra are friends and supportive colleagues with a great deal of work to do running their respective and interlocking empires. Romeo and Juliet have no sense of humor; Antony and Cleopatra live by elaborate jokes and highly personal forms of teasing. (“That time, — Oh times! — I laugh’d him out of patience …”) Romeo and Juliet, utterly absorbed, pay no attention to others around them; Antony and Cleopatra love to gossip about the odd people in their world, spend evenings wandering the streets, watching the funny things people do, structuring love through daily life. Romeo and Juliet speak in terms of worshipful hyperbole. Antony knows how to make contact with Cleopatra through insults, even about her age; she knows how to turn a story about a fishhook into a running joke that renews laughter each time it is mentioned.

The love between Antony and Cleopatra lasts for at least a decade, and the texture of time past, present and future seasons it. The human body is a river of time, and these two pay attention to one another’s real bodies, not idealized images of the body. And the body is always seen as animated by a lively, searching and idiosyncratic mind that makes contact with another particular mind through intimate conversation.

Cleopatra is clearly supposed to be attractive, but the play, unlike Shakespeare’s sources, plays down this aspect. It is her complicated personality, full of surprises, to which Shakespeare most draws our attention. (“Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.”) Her mode of seduction is above all mental. “Cunning past men’s thought,” as Antony notes, she ingeniously elaborates a whole battery of stratagems to keep herself in the forefront of his attention: flirtation, capricious annoyance, the constant private teasing, frustrating allusions to significant undelivered information; but also, shared ambition, trusting collaboration, sincere deeply felt admiration for his achievements, insistence on her own equality.

Shakespeare’s teenage lovers seem unaware that every human being has flaws and personal vulnerabilities that real love needs to handle gently and respectfully. Not so our aging lovers. In the scene after the devastating battle of Actium, in which their combined military forces were decisively defeated, Cleopatra displays a delicate attunement to Antony’s self-esteem, intuiting what should and should not be said.

And then there’s Octavia, Antony’s lawful wife, and Cleopatra’s outsize jealousy. Aging love always has baggage. Baggage can be a source of richness; it can be a source of pain. It can be both at the same time. What is certain is that living with a partner’s whole past and present life is a challenge that young lovers typically do not have to face. Facing it well requires many qualities — a sense of one’s own limits, humor, altruism, endurance, humility, self-knowledge — that young lovers have not yet been called upon to develop.

Romeo and Juliet’s love transfigured the world by raising love into the heavens: Juliet is the sun, and, as with the sun, we have no idea what, if anything, makes her laugh. Antony and Cleopatra transfigure the world from within, making each daily experience more vivid, funny and surprising. Without each other, they both feel, the world is sadly boring. “Shall I abide in this dull world,” she asks as he dies, “which in thy absence is no better than a sty?” What’s piggish to her is the absence of interesting conversation. So the world does need to be transfigured by love, but the transfiguration is human and particular, rather than celestial and abstract.

What do we learn from this woman, who, unlike the Marschallin, makes a deep, satisfying and mature choice? We see that mature love is both sexual and personal and that its sexuality is itself personal, based upon memory, humor, shared history. For that reason it has a depth that youthful love can’t have, and that the Marschallin’s vain attempt to find love with a 17-year-old could never deliver. For the Marschallin, love brings neither comedy nor tragedy, only polite resignation. For Antony and Cleopatra, love is comic because of its bodily and temporal particularity. And for that reason it is also tragic, open to huge and irreparable loss.

Lies don’t always endure. Finally, in recent years, Hollywood and television, prodded by a group of extraordinary aging actresses (Helen Mirren, Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton among them) are just beginning to move away from stereotypes and to explore the truths that Shakespeare articulated. But that is a story for another day.

That’s because you qualify for additional discounts that will lower your deductible and co-payment, making a silver plan even more generous than a gold plan. Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the president’s actions, will protect you from premium price increases.

The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year. The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent — by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.

Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for what’s happening with the entire health insurance market. But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types aren’t rising as fast. Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent. Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.

Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well. The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did. In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.

BARCELONA, Spain — Hours after the Spanish authorities announced that they would seek to prosecute Catalonia’s separatists for rebellion, Carles Puigdemont, the region’s dismissed leader, turned up on Monday in Belgium, where he may seek asylum.

Mr. Puigdemont’s reputation for unpredictability has grown with every turn of Catalonia’s secessionist drama . On Monday, he all but disappeared as the Madrid central government began using emergency laws to take over direct administration of Catalonia after its declaration of independence last week.

Monday was no exception. Speculation had mounted as to what he was up to over the course of the day, until a lawyer in Belgium finally ended the mystery surrounding Mr. Puigdemont’s whereabouts late Monday.

“I have been consulted by Puigdemont and he asked me to protect his interests in the future in Belgium,” said Paul Bekaert , a Flemish lawyer.

Mr. Bekaert said the two men had met in Belgium and that the conversation was “about what possibly could come, whatever the Spanish government has ready for him.”

Mr. Bekaert emphasized his “more than 30 years of experience with extradition and political asylum” cases, including with Basques who advocated for separation from Spain.

Belgium is virtually the only national government in Europe that has been even remotely sympathetic to Mr. Puigdemont’s pleas for mediation, not least perhaps because the country has faced separatist tensions of its own led by Flemish hard-liners.

Awkwardly, Brussels is also the headquarters of a European Union bureaucracy that has held the Catalan secessionists at arms’ length, for fear of upsetting Spain , one of the bloc’s largest member states, and stoking forces of fragmentation in other parts of the Continent.

On Monday, while there was no official confirmation that Mr. Puigdemont had gone to Brussels, the Belgian and Spanish news media variously suggested that he had arrived for consultations, to seek political asylum, or to even declare a Catalan “government in exile.”

The speculation kicked into high gear not long after Spain’s attorney general, José Manuel Maza, called around noon in Madrid for the prosecution of Mr. Puigdemont and another 19 Catalan politicians, stopping short of ordering their immediate arrest.

Mr. Maza said he wanted them Catalan politicians to appear “urgently” in court in Madrid. A decision would be left to Spanish judges whether to charge or jail them. The politicians could face 30 years in prison for the most serious of the potential charges, which included rebellion and sedition.

Officially, the Belgian government said they had no knowledge of Mr. Puigdemont’s presence in their country.

But the statements of some officials seemed to hint at an openness to accepting Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan officials if they chose exile.

“It is not unrealistic, if you see the situation at this moment, and the repression from Madrid and the prison sentences with which they are threatening, that the question is whether such a person still has a chance to a fair trial of course,” Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, told VTM News, a Belgian television station, over the weekend.

“That’s where we enter into a difficult diplomatic situation with the Spanish government,” he added.

Mr. Francken is a member of the New Flemish Alliance party, which favors Flemish independence from the rest of Belgium and has historically had strong links to the Catalan separatists as a kindred movement. Earlier this month, members of the alliance hung the Catalan independence flag — the Estelada —in the Belgian Parliament, in a gesture of support.

But Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel, has dismissed the possibility of granting asylum to Mr. Puigdemont, saying it “is absolutely not on the agenda” and called on Mr. Francken “not to fan the flames.”

Mr. Puigdemont’s arrival presents a direct challenge to Mr. Michel, a Federalist, who as the leader of a delicate government coalition, will have to keep separatists in his own government in check while trying to maintain good diplomatic relations with Spain.

Spanish media had reported that Mr. Puigdemont had left Catalonia with five other deposed members of his cabinet, by car to the southern French city of Marseille, and then by plane to Brussels.

Officials from Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s conservative Popular Party said their priority on Monday was to make sure Mr. Puigdemont did not try to stay in office, by insisting he remained leader of Catalonia, rather than worry about him escaping the country.

Fernando Martínez-Maíllo, a senior Popular Party official, characterized Mr. Puigdemont’s departure as “a desperate act.”

Albert Rivera, the leader of the Ciudadanos party, which is strongly opposed to secession, accused Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist leadership of “fleeing the country” while leaving his Catalan civil servants to resist and continue to break Spanish law.

Indeed, the forcible steps by the central government have now left Catalan civil servants and politicians with the painful choice of sticking to their secessionist plans and defying Madrid’s direct administration or facing the potential of criminal charges.

Not least, there was the important decision for separatist parties about whether to take part in regional elections called by Madrid or to risk sidelining themselves.

The two main Catalan parties — including Mr. Puigdemont’s Catalan European Democratic Party — said on Monday they would run in the elections, which are scheduled for Dec. 21, although perhaps no longer as part of the coalition that won the most parliamentary seats in 2015.

Germà Bel, a separatist Catalan lawmaker, said Mr. Puigdemont’s possible hopes of running a government from exile was “symbolic.”

“I don’t know of anyone who’s run a government from overseas,” he said. “Even Charles de Gaulle didn’t run a government from overseas.”

But he argued that it would be hard for Mr. Rajoy’s government to maintain control over Catalonia for an extended period.

The decision by pro-independence parties to take part in the December elections meant that they “at least implicitly” accept they are still part of Spain — no small concession.

“This election has been called by the Spanish government under Spanish law — and it will be an election run within the state,” Mr. Bel said.

With the emergency measures taken over the weekend, Mr. Rajoy opted not to appoint a caretaker leader of Catalonia.

Instead, the country’s deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, took over the management of the Catalan administration from Madrid, and dispatched a senior central government official to Barcelona on Monday.

Juan Ignacio Zoido, the Spanish interior minister, said on Monday that the takeover of the Catalan police force, known as the Mossos, had gone smoothly. He fired the Mossos police chief, Josep Lluís Trapero , over the weekend and appointed the deputy leader of the force, Ferran López, to the post.

Under the emergency measures allowed by Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution , the provision invoked by Mr. Rajoy to take control of Catalonia, the national government could replace the 17,000 officers of the Mossos with Spanish police officers.

But Mr. Zoido said that “at no point did we consider eliminating the Mossos police corps.”

Mr. Zoido called on separatist leaders to remove their personal belongings from their offices on Monday and to leave, focusing solely on preparing for the December elections, as candidates.

At least one member of Mr. Puigdemont’s ousted cabinet, Josep Rull, defiantly went to work Monday morning, after the region’s president sent a message over the weekend urging Catalans to peacefully oppose Madrid’s takeover and the removal of a democratically elected regional government.

After spending one hour in his office, Mr. Rull, the Catalan minister for planning and sustainability, left in a waiting car, but without his police detail, telling reporters that he had not removed his belongings from his office.

“Today I came to my office to carry out the work that the Catalan people entrusted to us,” he said. “And now I will continue, normally, with my agenda.”

The possibility that separatist leaders might be charged with rebellion has prompted a major dispute among Spanish lawyers.

Diego López Garrido, who drafted changes to the Spanish legal code relating to rebellion, told Antena 3 that “in my judgment, there is no crime of rebellion because no violence has been produced.”

A United States District Court judge on Monday blocked a White House policy barring military service by transgender troops, noting that the policy did not appear to be based on facts, but instead on “a desire to express disapproval of transgender people generally.”

President Trump announced in a series of tweets in July that American forces could not afford the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of transgender troops, and said “the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” A presidential memorandum released in August required all transgender service members to be discharged by March.

Transgender groups sued the administration in late August on behalf of transgender service members, arguing that the ban was discriminatory and violated their constitutional right to due process equal protection under the law.

On Monday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia issued an injunction blocking enforcement of the ban until the case was resolved, saying the effect of the order was to revert to the status quo.

The judge — who was named to the court by President Bill Clinton — noted in her ruling that the changes in transgender policy were “not genuinely based on legitimate concerns regarding military effectiveness or budget constraints, but are instead driven by a desire to express disapproval of transgender people generally.”

What is a special counsel?

Normally, United States attorneys oversee criminal investigations. But their decisions are subject to the oversight and control of the attorney general.

In cases that raise questions about high-ranking executive branch officials, the attorney general can appoint a special counsel to run an investigation with greater autonomy from the president’s political appointees.

Is Mr. Mueller fully independent?

No. The central attribute that makes an official completely independent of the White House — protection from being fired at the president’s direction — is no longer legally possible for a prosecutor.

After the Watergate scandal, when President Richard M. Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate prosecutor in the so-called Saturday Night Massacre, Congress created a law that permitted the appointment of an investigator who would be shielded from political interference.

Initially called a special prosecutor and later called an independent counsel, this investigator was supervised by a panel of judges and could not be fired by the president. The Justice Department did not control the investigation’s budget, duration or expansion.

While the Supreme Court upheld this arrangement, critics said it allowed the prosecutor to run amok.

Republicans learned to hate the arrangement during the Iran-contra investigation into the Reagan administration, and Democrats did, as well, during the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky investigations into President Bill Clinton.

When the independent counsel law expired in 1999, Congress did not renew it. Instead, the Justice Department during the Clinton administration issued internal regulations enabling the attorney general to appoint a special counsel.

But there appears to be room for potential conflict over how to interpret those regulations.

Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, noted that there was scant precedent to scrutinize when interpreting the 1999 regulations because only one previous special counsel was appointed under them.

That case involved misconduct by law enforcement officials, not a national security matter.

What are the limits of a special counsel’s autonomy?

Although Mr. Rosenstein’s letter says Mr. Mueller is authorized “to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” it also says he is subject to the special counsel regulations.

They give such a prosecutor a longer leash than a regular one, but the counsel’s discretionary powers still have limits.

The Justice Department will control Mr. Mueller’s budget. He must obey its “rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies.” And Mr. Rosenstein can supervise his major decisions.

How might the requirement to obey department practices matter?

Here are two examples of issues that could arise.

First, people disagree about whether a sitting president can be indicted, and no court has ever addressed that topic.

But the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has opined, in a 2000 memo, that the Constitution implicitly grants sitting presidents immunity from criminal prosecution.

The office’s opinions bind department practices, meaning Mr. Mueller seemingly would be barred from charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of justice — while he remains in office — no matter what the evidence shows.

Second, the regulations give special counsels the powers and functions of United States attorneys, who are normally required to consult, and in some cases get prior permission from, the Justice Department’s National Security Division before taking investigative steps in “national security matters.”

A requirement that foreign agents register, for example, is believed to be part of the Russia investigation.

Ambiguously, the regulations say special counsels may decide “whether and to what extent” to consult others in the department about the conduct of their duties.

But the rules also require the counsels to consult about matters touching on “security regulations and procedures.”

It is not clear how much Mr. Rosenstein expects Mr. Mueller to coordinate with the National Security Division.

Can Mr. Rosenstein overrule Mr. Mueller’s decisions?

Apparently. The regulations state: “The special counsel shall not be subject to the day-to-day supervision of any official of the department. However, the attorney general may request that the special counsel provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step, and may after review conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” If that happens, it adds, Congress must be notified.

Although this does not explicitly say the special counsel must obey, the Congressional Research Service has interpreted it as meaning the attorney general may countermand proposed actions. Neal Katyal, who led the 1999 working group that drafted the regulations, said they intended to empower attorneys general to overrule special counsels — while making sure the public would find out.

What about firing him?

The regulations authorize Mr. Rosenstein to remove Mr. Mueller “for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of departmental policies.” That means if Mr. Mueller and Mr. Rosenstein disagree about how to interpret department practices, and Mr. Mueller goes forward with a step Mr. Rosenstein deemed inappropriate, Mr. Mueller could be fired.

Moreover, the Government Accountability Office has concluded that the special counsel regulations “do not have the force and effect of law and may be waived by the department.” Therefore, Mr. Trump could direct Mr. Rosenstein to waive — or revoke — the regulations and fire Mr. Mueller without citing any reason.",Here’s What a Special Counsel Means in the Russia Investigation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/special-counsel-in-russia-investigation-raises-stakes-for-trump.html

Digital humanities has been accused of fetishizing science, of acting as a Trojan horse for the corporate forces threatening the university, and worse. A recent broadside in The Chronicle of Higher Education called “The Digital-Humanities Bust” took a bludgeon to the field’s revolutionary rhetoric, with Mr. Moretti among those accused of issuing a stream of vague “promissory notes” for results that never arrive.

Mr. Moretti — who prefers to call the lab’s work “computational criticism” — tends to greet such challenges with a mixture of modesty and bravado.

“Our results are not as good as what I had hoped for 10 or 15 years ago,” he said in an interview earlier this month, during a brief trip to New York. “We have not yet created a revolution in knowledge. But how much of literary scholarship is even trying to do that?”

[Read about some of the Stanford Literary Lab’s findings.]

Mr. Moretti, who was born to teacher parents in a small town in northern Italy (his brother is the filmmaker Nanni Moretti), represents something of a paradox. He’s an intellectual trained in the grand European tradition who questions its most cherished methods. And he’s a professor who has achieved some measure of celebrity by promoting a ruthlessly impersonal idea of both scholarship and literary history itself.

Literary criticism typically tends to emphasize the singularity of exceptional works that have stood the test of time. But the canon, Mr. Moretti argues, is a distorted sample. Instead, he says, scholars need to consider the tens of thousands of books that have been forgotten, a task that computer algorithms and enormous digitized databases have now made possible.

“We know how to read texts,” he wrote in a much-quoted essay included in his book “Distant Reading,” which won the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism. “Now let’s learn how to not read them.”

These days, Mr. Moretti has softened his rhetoric, though the underlying point is the same.

“Reading is one of life’s greatest pleasures,” which we “would be insane” to give up, he said. “But the question is whether reading and knowledge are continuous with each other.”

Mr. Moretti’s own output has a similar dividedness. His early work was grounded in close reading, and his last book “The Bourgeois: Between History and Literature,” included fine-grained analysis of classic works.

That his digital provocations command wide interest even among highly skeptical colleagues may owe something to what Leah Price, professor of English at Harvard, called a “Nixon in China” effect.

“Only because his own close readings are so dazzling, does Moretti have the credibility to say: Read as closely as you want, but if you want to understand literary history you’ll need other tools,” she said.

The literary quality of the lab’s pamphlets, which are usually credited to teams of researchers, also doesn’t hurt. Yes, they bristle with bar charts, scatterplot diagrams and sometimes eyeball-blistering terminology. (“‘Operationalizing’ must be the ugliest word I’ve ever used,” Mr. Moretti writes in the first sentence of a solo-authored pamphlet called… “Operationalizing.”)

But they are also full of witty asides and suspenseful first-person narration that acknowledges surprises, dead-ends and the collaborative, experimental nature of the lab’s work.

“They’re very good at dramatizing the method,” said Ted Underwood, a professor at the University of Illinois who also uses computational analysis. “That’s part of the fun of reading them.”

Some of the lab’s results may seem less than earthshaking. For example, it turns out that what distinguishes the Gothic novel isn’t just castles and ghosts, but more frequent use of the certain verb tenses and prepositions. (The critic Kathryn Schulz, writing about some of the early pamphlets in The New York Times Book Review in 2011, said she “mostly vacillated between two reactions: ‘Huh?’ and ‘Duh!’”)

But even modest-seeming results — like the finding that from 1785 to 1900 the language of the British novel steadily shifted away from words relating to moral judgment to words associated with concrete description — unsettle established ideas of literary history.

“We tend to see literary history as a story of movements, periods, sudden revolutions,” Mr. Underwood said. “There are also these really broad, slow, massive changes that we haven’t described before.”

Some of the lab’s findings have themselves had sudden, and totally unexpected, real-world results. Mr. Moretti noted with amusement a flap last spring at the World Bank, where Paul Romer, the chief economist, was relieved of some management duties at its research arm after demanding, among other changes, that its publications reduce their use of the word “and” — one of the stylistic tics mocked in “Bankspeak,” a Lit Lab pamphlet analyzing the bank’s drift over 60 years toward more abstract and “self-referential” language.

“How many literary critics can say they got the chief economist of the World Bank, O.K., not fired, but deprived of some of his power?” Mr. Moretti said with a laugh.

Since retiring from Stanford, Mr. Moretti has moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he is helping to create a new digital humanities program at the country’s leading polytechnic.

He also has a full slate of writing projects, including a study of forgotten 19th-century British best-sellers and an algorithm-free book based on his undergraduate lectures on American culture, to be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

Even if the results of computational criticism never catch up with his early polemical fervor, Mr. Moretti remains unapologetic about trying.

“There is going to be an enormous crush of borrowers who think they are eligible only to find that they are not,” said Seth Frotman, the student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which published a report on the subject in June. “We need to get ready for it.”

All Mr. Shafer has been trying to do for more than 25 years is get ready for a career where he could make a difference while also earning enough to buy a home and help raise a family.

He and his wife live with their two sons, ages 10 and 4.

At work, Mr. Shafer offers job interview advice to one student while plotting financial aid application strategies with another. The classroom where he and his colleagues work has notices on the walls about housing and a free Thanksgiving dinner.

But at home over the last two years, he has spent many hours communicating with his current loan servicer, FedLoan, which is part of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. Eventually, he contacted elected officials and the Department of Education’s ombudsman department. The fact that he has had more than one servicer is a big part of what seems to have gone wrong.

As Mr. Shafer tells it, teacher circles were abuzz back in 2007 when the federal public service loan forgiveness program came into existence. Five years earlier, he had consolidated all of his student loans into a single one. At the time, his servicer verified his income and put him into a repayment plan where his payments would grow slowly over time, presumably as his income grew.

In 2007, Mr. Shafer said, he called his servicer at the time, ACS Education Services, and told the company that he wanted to enroll in the public service loan forgiveness program. No problem, he said he had been told, as long as he made his payments on time for 120 months. When ACS exited the federal loan servicing business, his loan moved to Mohela, short for the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, in 2012. Nothing, he said, that he heard or saw from Mohela gave him pause.

In 2013, he heard this from a fellow teacher: Once borrowers in the public service loan forgiveness program reached 120 payments, only one servicer, FedLoan, could forgive the remaining balance. So Mr. Shafer did what he needed to do to move his loans there.

It was at that point that things began to go off the rails. Remember that repayment program that Mr. Shafer ended up in back in 2002? It is what’s known as a graduated repayment plan, and if you’re in one, you’re not eligible for public service loan forgiveness. He was supposed to be in one of the income-based plans.

All along, Mr. Shafer said, people at the three servicers told him that his loan was in “good status” when he asked whether he was on track for forgiveness in 2017. The phone representatives at these servicers, however, may have been defining that term more narrowly — namely, that he was merely making on-time payments. It’s also possible that they simply didn’t understand the highly specific requirements of the loan forgiveness program.

In 2015, Mr. Shafer received an email from FedLoan that definitively alerted him to the fact that none of his eight years of payments had counted toward forgiveness. He panicked and spent the next year fighting back, flabbergasted that so much time had gone by without any of the three servicers telling him that anything was wrong when he had quite specifically and repeatedly inquired.

Photo

So why didn’t they? A spokesman for ACS’s current owner said it could not comment on the concerns of a past borrower, even though Mr. Shafer granted the company permission to do so. A Mohela spokesman said that while it didn’t have specific records of having told Mr. Shafer that his payments were not qualifying, its phone representative’s contact with him in January 2013 was probably what spurred him to move his loans to FedLoan to become eligible for the forgiveness program. Mr. Shafer said that was not so.

At FedLoan, a spokesman said it had told Mr. Shafer that he had a problem, more than once, by phone and through other communications. Indeed, in Mr. Shafer’s pile of documents, I did find a 2014 statement that said, on the back, that he had not made any qualifying payments. Mr. Shafer had missed that, and many others probably did, too, given that FedLoan didn’t bother to put this crucial piece of information on the front of the bill, let alone in 100-point neon “You are doing this wrong” type.

As for FedLoan’s specific assertion that it disclosed the problem to him by phone in 2013, Mr. Shafer responds with the following: Why on earth would he have not jumped on the problem instantly and aggressively if he had heard that in 2013?

There does not appear to be any happy ending in the offing for Mr. Shafer, and after a year of appeals, he did move himself into an eligible repayment plan. If nothing else happens to mess this all up again, he should finish paying off his loans when he is 55, about the time that his first child starts college. That will be 37 years after he took out his first loan as a teenager.

Worried that your story will end with similar bad news? There are four crucial requirements in the public service loan forgiveness program. You have to be in an eligible job, with an eligible loan, making the right kind of payments (which was what tripped Mr. Shafer up) and doing so in the right way. A column I wrote in April outlines the process, even if conquering it proves to be another matter.

Mr. Shafer remains baffled by it all. Perspiring at his dining room table this week after a meal of halibut that he had caught himself, he sipped a second adult beverage and tried to understand what had happened. In what other area of life, he wondered aloud, would you pay your bills on time only to be told that the payments hadn’t counted?

Later on in the week, he put it like so: “They have the power, regardless of my service and full payments, to make me look inept. Though I have been working hard for 18 years to help young people graduate from high school and build a viable future — and have been sending a large chunk of my paycheck back to the very government I work for — they will surely win based on their documentation.”

So this is who we are now. For all sorts of reasons that made perfect sense at the time, we built additional repayment programs onto existing complexity onto well-meaning forgiveness overseen by multiple layers of responsible parties. And once that was done, Mr. Shafer, teacher of shelter dwellers and street kids and others whom fellow educators failed to reach, wasted a small fortune and will now shovel another one into the federal coffers.

“She put her arms around me.”But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team.
Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others).
As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played “the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.” The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered.","She said she told her lawyer to pull the offer within a day of The New York Times publishing an article that detailed decades of Mr. Weinstein’s alleged sexual harassment, aggression and misconduct toward women, as well as at least seven other settlements he had reached with accusers. After that, the dam burst, with The New Yorker, The Times and other news outlets reporting on dozens of other women’s experiences with Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein, his accusers say, built his long history of abusing women on a risky gamble that worked for him over and over — the assumption that money or threats could buy women’s silence on a subject so intimate and painful that most would prefer not to go public anyway. While Ms. McGowan was the rare voice suggesting that the cover-up was not fail-safe, even she considered not naming him, having already, she believes, paid a career price for that long-ago episode and its aftermath.

A Weinstein spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said that “Mr. Weinstein unequivocally denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex.” Ms. McGowan’s lawyer, Paul Coggins, confirmed that Ms. McGowan received the offer.

By 2015, Ms. McGowan, who felt alienated by the industry, started using her sizable platform on Twitter to maximize her status as both insider and outsider — someone with enough Hollywood experience to speak with authority about sexism within it, and someone liberated enough from its compromises to unleash the fury in her that had been building for years. Only now does the scope of the news about Mr. Weinstein — and the public conversation about what’s wrong with Hollywood — seem to match the scale of her outrage, giving her the clout of a contrarian at last proven right.

On Friday, at the inaugural Women’s Convention in Detroit, she was a featured speaker — a new, combative face of feminism, endowed with Hollywood charisma yet anything but slick. “I have been silenced for 20 years,” she told the gathering. “I have been slut-shamed. I have been harassed. I have been maligned. And you know what? I’m just like you.”

A Crusade Gathers Strength

As other women told their stories in recent weeks, Ms. McGowan not only addressed what happened to her but also attacked those she considered complicit.

When the actor Ben Affleck claimed he never knew of Mr. Weinstein’s history, she wrote in a tweet: “‘GODDAMNIT! I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT’ you said that to my face,” adding, “The press conf I was made to go to after assault. You lie.” (Mr. Affleck declined to comment.) She called out the larger apparatus of Hollywood, criticizing talent agencies — “you are guilty of human trafficking,” she wrote — and a film studio that she believed knew of Mr. Weinstein’s alleged misconduct.

When Twitter suspended her account — the company said that it was because she had published a private phone number — users retaliated with a boycott that drew support from celebrities such as the actress Alyssa Milano and the writer Cheryl Strayed. The actor and filmmaker Jordan Peele tweeted, in response to Ms. McGowan’s blistering attacks, a moody still of her from “Grindhouse” in which she surveys burning wreckage her character has wrought. “Get ’em, Rose,” he wrote.

On Oct. 13, the day of the boycott, Ms. McGowan retreated from Los Angeles, where she had been working on her memoir, to a beach cottage in Hawaii, safely ensconced behind two gates, near a park locals call the City of Refuge. “I wanted to come to a place that had so much power to it, that it could hold a lot at bay — a lot of monster energy,” said Ms. McGowan, sitting at a picnic table near the ocean. “I came to a place that almost has a protective zone around it.” Her hair was short, but not shaven, as it had been in the past. Once featured on the covers of Maxim and Rolling Stone as a longhaired, barely dressed object of desire, Ms. McGowan seems to have settled on an aesthetic of chic simplicity.

If not a time of celebration, this moment could be perceived as a moment of vindication for Ms. McGowan. Yes, she said, she sometimes feels like laughing — “kind of like a witch’s cackle,” she clarified. But at other times she feels emotionally raw, just knowing that a click on her phone would bring her to conversations others were having about her assault allegation. The phone had come to feel too powerful: “It’s like a live wire that you’re holding in your mouth, and it goes directly to your brain,” she said.

The Meeting and the Aftermath

Her story of assault, although uniquely her own, shares some of the now familiar hallmarks of a Weinstein encounter. Ms. McGowan, then 23, was in Park City, Utah, in early 1997 to attend the Sundance Film Festival and the screening of a film in which she appeared, “Going All the Way.” She had also recently appeared as a smart-mouthed beauty who dies a gruesome death in the blockbuster film “Scream,” on which Mr. Weinstein was an executive producer.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Ms. McGowan’s manager then, Jill Messick, told her to meet Mr. Weinstein at the restaurant in the Stein Eriksen Lodge for a 10 a.m. appointment. On her arrival, the maître d’ directed the actress upstairs to Mr. Weinstein’s suite, she said. Ms. McGowan remembers passing two male assistants on the way in. “They wouldn’t look me in the eye,” she recalled.

She sat at the far end of a couch as Mr. Weinstein sat in a club chair, and they had a brief business meeting. But on their way out, she said, he interrupted himself to point out that the hotel room had a hot tub. “And then what happened, happened,” said Ms. McGowan, who has described her experience, on Twitter, as rape. “Suffice it to say a door opened and my life changed.”

She declined to share the details of the encounter. “That’s my story to tell,” she said emphatically. But she said that she walked out of the hotel suite and directly into a press event. She remembers fighting back tears, and the conversation with Mr. Affleck. She said she told Ms. Messick, then of Addis-Wechsler & Associates, what had occurred. “She held me,” Ms. McGowan said. “She put her arms around me.”

But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team. She was referred to a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment and assault cases who, Ms. McGowan said, gave her the impression that filing a criminal charge was hopeless. “She was like, ‘You’re an actress, you’ve done a sex scene, you’re done,’” she recalled.

Anne Woodward, now a manager herself, was a young assistant in Ms. Messick’s office at the time, and was in on many of Ms. Messick’s calls. “I remember that Rose was extremely upset and did not want to settle,” Ms. Woodward said. “She wanted to fight.” No one around her, as Ms. Woodward recalls, supported that instinct. “It was an emotionally shocking way to see a woman being treated,” Ms. Woodward said. “That’s what stuck with me.”

Nick Wechsler, then a principal at Addis-Wechsler & Associates, said that he and his partner, Keith Addis, met with Mr. Weinstein at Ms. Messick’s request and confronted him with Ms. McGowan’s claim. “I remember Harvey saying he was going to get psychiatric treatment or some kind of therapy for his sexual behavior,” Mr. Wechsler said.

Ms. McGowan initially asked for about $25,000, enough money to cover her therapy; by the time she signed the settlement, the amount had been raised to $100,000. Both Ms. Woodward and Ms. McGowan were shocked when, only a few months afterward, Ms. Messick accepted a job working as vice president for development at Miramax, then run by Mr. Weinstein. Ms. Messick did not respond to a request for comment.

At the time of the alleged assault, Ms. McGowan had finally been emerging from the trials of an insecure childhood, with loving but unconventional parents: Her father, said his sister, Rory McGowan, Rose’s aunt, “almost certainly had undiagnosed manic-depressive disorder.” He was the leader of a religious cult in Italy, from which Rose’s grandmother extracted her before she reached middle school. Both parents were hippie intellectuals, members of the counterculture who taught their children to prize independent thinking and buck the system.

Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others). “Rose was never this sweet, simple soul — there was always something ferocious about her,” Ms. Corman said. “After that assault, a light dimmed. I remember her souring on the powers that be. And she became very protective of us. It was sometimes cryptic: Keep your guard up.”

Ms. McGowan’s friends watched as she made choices that surprised them, including beginning a relationship with Marilyn Manson, a controversial rock star and ordained Satanist who has called himself “the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles.” (“I ran away for three years and joined the circus,” Ms. McGowan said of that romantic involvement.) She showed up for the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1998 in a dress made of tiny beads that left her nearly nude. “That was my first big public appearance after being assaulted,” she said. “And I thought — you want to see a body? I did it with a giant middle finger.”

Camilla Rantsen was also a young actress in Los Angeles who was close to Ms. McGowan, and was aware, only through friends, of what had transpired. “I think some of the people she started surrounding herself with weren’t as great as the people she had before,” said Ms. Rantsen, who is now a writer.

Plenty of young actresses with promising starts see their careers founder for one reason or another. But Ms. McGowan believes that after she finished up work on “Phantoms,” a 1998 film produced by Miramax, her career suffered because collaborations with Weinstein productions were for many years off the table. “And they were doing the kinds of movies that I would be doing,” she said.

She continued to work, on “Charmed” until 2006, but also in independent films. Eventually, she appeared in both of the two films packaged as “Grindhouse,” directed by Robert Rodriguez, with whom she was romantically involved, and by Quentin Tarantino. It was distributed by Dimension, run by Bob Weinstein, Harvey’s brother. As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played “the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.” The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered. “I was really lost at that point,” she said. “I was damaged.”

Shunning ‘Celebrity’

It is impossible to predict how Ms. McGowan’s career path in film would have proceeded had the episode with Mr. Weinstein never occurred. She is an unconventional figure, occasionally provocative and profane, but also sometimes old-fashioned and even formal in spirit. “I never considered myself a celebrity,” she said at one point. “I hate that word. It’s tawdry.”

Ms. McGowan became an increasingly outspoken voice for women mistreated by Hollywood. In 2015, she was dropped from her agency after mocking a casting call that encouraged women to wear push-up bras in auditions. (Her agent had been fired a few days earlier, but the agency did not fight to retain her, as agencies typically do of valued clients.)

In The Hollywood Reporter, she passionately defended Renée Zellweger last year from what she perceived as sexist comments in Variety about the actress’s plastic surgery. “How dare you bully a woman who has done nothing but try to entertain people like you?” she wrote, in a direct accusation of the piece’s writer, Owen Glieberman.

“It was startling and inspiring to see someone who was willing to put herself out there in support of other women/actresses,” said the actress Molly Ringwald in an email to The Times. “Her tenacity is something that you would hope for in an union leader but of course never really get.”

And Ms. McGowan spoke, in veiled terms, to the Buzzfeed reporter Kate Aurthur in 2015 about her experience as an assault victim. “You are taking part of someone’s soul,” she said. “It’s happened to me.” Last year, during a Twitter campaign called #WhyWomenDontReport, she all but named Mr. Weinstein as the perpetrator of the violence against her that she had mentioned in the past.

During her recent visit to Hawaii, Ms. McGowan, over a day and a half in Kona, revealed a person much more playful than her fierce Twitter persona. She would interrupt a thought to smile and smell a flower that caught her eye; she could not resist a swing hanging from a large tree, and enjoyed twirling an umbrella the same blue as her sundress while walking on the beach. She seemed free, in some ways, from both a long-kept secret and a labor of love that had occupied her for the last year and a half — her book, “Brave,” which will be released by Harper One early next year.

To some degree, she had shielded herself from the news. But when she learned how many women had stepped forward to complain of assault or harassment by Mr. Weinstein, she said: “I knew we are legion. We are legion.” She had been corresponding lately with Asia Argento, an Italian actress who also accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual assault (and was subsequently shamed by the Italian press). “It feels,” Ms. McGowan wrote to Ms. Argento, reading from her text, “‘like toxic slime going out of a spiked birth canal.’ That’s what the whole experience feels like to me. It’s an intense process.”

Sometimes she feels fresh rage. “But I’ll tell you what I don’t feel anymore,” she said. “Despair.”","Refusing Weinstein’s Hush Money, Rose McGowan Calls Out Hollywood",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/rose-mcgowan-harvey-weinstein.html

The important difference is in how stipend levels are set. Today’s stipends are not driven by the market, but are set according to legislatively established formulas. But the type of premium support Medicare reformers usually advocate — what people generally mean when they use this term — would use market signals to set stipend levels.

“Premium support could result in increased efficiency in the Medicare program,” said Bryan Dowd, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, and co-author of a book that analyzed various premium support options. That efficiency could push the hospital trust fund depletion date further into the future and reduce “the financial burden on future generations.”

Premium support models take many forms, but there are two crucial variables. One is how stipend levels are set, which determines how much of beneficiaries’ own money they need to contribute. The other key feature of premium support is how much the stipend grows over time. Both aspects are hotly debated.

In some versions of premium support, the stipend level would grow more slowly than health care costs, forcing people to pay more out of pocket over time to purchase coverage. In other versions, the stipend level would grow at the same rate as health care costs, so beneficiaries would continue to pay about the same share of their own money for health insurance.

Most premium support approaches would retain traditional Medicare, though its fate would be uncertain, a source of controversy. “A lot rides on how the government’s support level differentially impacts the cost to beneficiaries of private plans versus traditional Medicare,” said Timothy McBride, a health economist with Washington University in St. Louis. Geography also plays a role. “If traditional Medicare is disadvantaged, that would hit rural beneficiaries harder, because a larger share of rural America relies on the traditional program than do urban Americans.”

As a report this month from the Congressional Budget Office reveals, how much premium support could save the government varies considerably depending on how stipend levels are established. Across the variations the C.B.O. examined, Medicare spending could fall by as much as 9 percent or as little as about 0.5 percent. But premiums could rise, including the premium for traditional Medicare. Under one projection, the C.B.O. estimates, traditional Medicare’s premium could double.

In all the scenarios the C.B.O. analyzed, stipend levels would be based on bids from Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare that reflect the cost to cover a person for standard Medicare services. Stipend levels would keep pace with overall health care costs, but they could still be lower than what many Medicare beneficiaries receive today.

For example, tying the stipend to the second-lowest bid and requiring all Medicare beneficiaries to be subject to that new, lower level would save $419 billion over 2022-2026, the C.B.O. estimated.

Tying it to the average bid or requiring only new beneficiaries to be subject to the new stipend would save less. In either case, people would have access to plans that don’t cost more than today’s. But those who opted for more expensive plans because they offer more benefits, or the traditional program because it covers any doctor willing to accept Medicare patients, would pay more out of pocket. Consequently, more people would opt for cheaper, private plans — and fewer would choose traditional Medicare.

This worries some health policy experts. “Traditional Medicare has been the leader in reforming the health care payment and delivery system to improve efficiency,” said Paul Van de Water, senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “It has outperformed private insurance in holding down the growth of health costs, but its ability to continue to do that would shrink significantly if premium support caused its enrollment to dwindle.”

Exactly how much more people would pay depends not only on the plans they select, but also on where they live. In some markets, many plans, including the traditional program, might charge premiums close to the second-lowest bid. In others, plans that many beneficiaries may want might cost a lot more.

In the premium support debate, there’s a fundamental lesson: It’s conceptually simple to reduce federal spending on health care, but it’s very hard to do so in a way that doesn’t increase costs for at least some consumers. To actually reduce total (not just federal) health care spending for everyone, one has to overhaul how care is delivered, not just how it is paid for. That’s much harder.",How a Republican Idea for Reducing Medicare Costs Could Affect You,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/upshot/how-a-republican-idea-for-reducing-medicare-costs-could-affect-you.html

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity — not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: “Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood? I could be the size of Marlon Brando in ‘Apocalypse Now,’ who’s going to know?”

You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with “Star Wars,” which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal. The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.

But Mr. Hamill isn’t bitter or jaded, and he isn’t Luke, though he has retained some of that character’s incorruptibility. He’s gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing “Star Wars” war stories.

At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought “Star Wars” into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.

“I’m such a fraud,” he said with a theatrical air. “But I’m enjoying all the residual attention that the movie’s getting. I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn. What’s not to love?”

On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin. The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to “Star Wars” — it’s mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamill’s own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of “Return of the Jedi.”

Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up. In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; he’ll slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues — the adenoidal clip of the “Star Wars” creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.

In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was “King Kong.”

Proudly recalling a fight scene from “Return of the Jedi,” Mr. Hamill said, “For me, sitting in the rancor’s hand, I was going all Fay Wray — it’s like a major accomplishment to me. But it was always that way. I’d say ‘Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3PO’s cereal!’”

The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings. He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.

When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could. “If I didn’t get a part, no problem,” he said. “Then where do I go? I sell tickets. I make props. I make posters. I don’t have to be in the show – I want to be near the show.”

He landed early roles on “General Hospital” and “The Partridge Family.” And then, of course, came “Star Wars”: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.

Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects. “I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity,” Mr. Lucas said. He added that Mr. Hamill “brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character,” and that “made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first ‘Star Wars.’”

Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience. “I thought, even if this thing doesn’t slay at the box office, it’s got midnight cult movie written all over it,” he said. “Move over, ‘Rocky Horror,’ ‘Star Wars’ is here!”

Instead, “Star Wars” became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford — even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them “Harry and Carrison” — as they promoted the movie together.

When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed “adequately,” Mr. Hamill “uninspiredly” and Ms. Fisher “wretchedly,” Mr. Hamill said, “We had T-shirts made: ‘adequate, uninspired and wretched.’ I said, ‘Harrison, adequate’s practically a rave compared to what we got.’”

Mr. Ford said that during this time, “the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness. We really were figuring this out as we went along.” Mr. Hamill struck him as “a very bright, sincere young actor,” who Mr. Ford said “seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.”

Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the “Star Wars” royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now. Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: “He’s a brilliant actor — that’s a given,” he said. “He’s also a leading man. When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.” Mr. Hamill believed he’d find his destiny on a different path — one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.

After two blockbuster sequels, “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980 and “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the “Star Wars” story was complete. With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in “The Elephant Man.” “I wasn’t getting character parts in movies and television,” he explained. “Unless you’re Meryl Streep, they don’t let you do accents.”

He starred in the Broadway production of “Amadeus” while “Return of the Jedi” was still in theaters. But his 1985 musical “Harrigan ’n Hart,” about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.

Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his “Star Wars” legacy. He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on “The Simpsons,” he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of “Guys and Dolls.” Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.

He was always comfortable being part of the “Star Wars” subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for “ultra-passionate fans”).

“It’s clearly not for everyone — I get that,” Mr. Hamill said. “But the passion of it all is just astonishing. The way it’s become part of the fabric of their lives — ‘I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia’ — it’s moving.”

He was not involved in the much-maligned “Star Wars” prequels from 1999 to 2005. And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new “Star Wars” trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate. “We figured we had the middle three,” he said. “It was over.”

When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, “I was completely stunned. Carrie, not a minute went by — she slapped the table and goes, ‘I’m in!’ I said, ‘Carrie, poker face!’”

Mr. Hamill needed more time to think. “I was just really scared,” he said. “I thought, why mess with it? The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.”

He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their “Star Wars” heyday. “No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star,” he said. “It’s sad.”

Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse “The Force Awakens,” expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.

“He’s too old and too rich and too cranky,” Mr. Hamill said. “He’s not going to do this.” But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: “Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no? I’d be the most hated man in nerd-dom.”

Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of “Star Wars” fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists. But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of “The Force Awakens,” and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Luke’s story line. (The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)

“The idea of it was so enormous,” Mr. Abrams said. “It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters. That had to be the next movie.”

Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in “The Force Awakens.” “I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal,” Mr. Abrams said. “I don’t think he knew just how minimal until he read it.”

In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was “not particularly happy with how little he was in it.”

Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Luke’s big reveal at the end would fall flat. “If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if there’s a big groan in the house, the egg’s on my face, not J.J.’s,” he said.

Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read — he jokingly calls it a “table listen” — of the “Force Awakens” script. He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration. (“I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse,” Mr. Hamill said.) Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.

Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in “The Force Awakens,” lamented that they had worked together on the early “Star Wars” movies far less than viewers realize.

“The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few,” he said. “I knew Chewbacca better.”

Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, “aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.”

“He’s very centered in his own experience and his own life,” Mr. Ford said. “He’s not a grandstander. He’s a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and that’s what we’re there for.”

Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in “The Force Awakens” — “when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, that’s fabulous,” he said.

But now he and the “The Last Jedi” creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.

“I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this,” said Rian Johnson, the “Last Jedi” writer and director. “Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.”

Mr. Johnson said “The Last Jedi” also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke. “In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with — the youthfulness and innocence — he now embodies a person full of soul and experience,” Mr. Johnson said.

While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the “Star Wars” filmmakers on big plot points — he’s still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister — he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in “The Last Jedi.”

“That’s the hard part,” Mr. Hamill said. “You don’t want to admit how possessive you’ve become. There are times where you go, ‘Really? That’s what they think of Luke? I’m not only in disagreement – I’m insulted.’ But that’s the process and you thrash it all out.”

The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December. Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent — someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to “Star Wars.”

Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his “Star Wars” work, he said, “She goes, ‘What’s your problem?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.’ She goes, ‘I am Princess Leia. You’re Luke Skywalker. Get used to it.’”

More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.

“She deserved that second act,” he said. “Harrison was more prominent in VII, I’m more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one. Her timing was perfect, except in this case.”

His “Star Wars” colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise — “He’s the last man standing,” said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in “The Force Awakens.”

But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.

“It means what it means to him, and that’s all that matters,” he said. “I’m sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and” — his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone — “that it’s all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.”

Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either. Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original “Star Wars” movies outside of theaters and has seen “The Force Awakens” only twice.

“All I notice are flaws,” he explained. “‘Oh, why did I do that?’ ‘Look at my hair.’ ‘What was I thinking?’”

During production of “The Force Awakens,” he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker — Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt — and was struck by what he saw. “They were all great,” Mr. Hamill said. “They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.”

One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is “A Hard Day’s Night,” Richard Lester’s madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.

As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, “I saw it originally going, ‘Oh, can you imagine it? Girls chasing me down the street! It looks like so much fun.’” But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light. “It’s like a horror movie,” he said. “They’re trapped. They can’t go anywhere.”

One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamill’s mind was the “Can’t Buy Me Love” sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.

“It’s the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy,” Mr. Hamill said. “It plays so differently now, when you’re on the other end of it.”",Luke Skywalker Speaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-mark-hamill.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The arrest shows that Mr. Trump, who vowed during his campaign to fill the wartime prison at Guantánamo Bay with “bad dudes,” is willing to use civilian courts to prosecute terrorism suspects captured overseas. The capture also marks a victory for F.B.I. officials, who had feared that such prosecutions would stagnate under Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Mr. Sessions has said for years that terrorism suspects should be held and prosecuted at Guantánamo Bay. He has said that terrorists do not deserve the same legal rights as common criminals and that such trials were too dangerous to hold in the United States.

Earlier this year, the United States extradited a man suspected of belonging to Al Qaeda from Spain to stand trial in the United States. European allies refuse to release suspects to be sent to the prison at Guantánamo Bay, complicating Mr. Trump’s rhetoric about filling the prison but demonstrating the realities of fighting terrorism in 2017.

The F.B.I.’s Hostage Rescue Team has worked closely for years with the military’s elite units to make such arrests. In 2013, the F.B.I. team took part in an operation to arrest Ahmed Abu Khattala, who was charged in the Benghazi attack and is being tried in Federal District Court in Washington. If convicted, Mr. Khattala faces a potential sentence of life in prison.

It was not clear how the arrest of a second suspect could affect Mr. Khattala’s trial. But officials said Mr. Imam was one of the men filmed entering and leaving the diplomatic compound the night of the attack and was an associate of Mr. Khattala.

Mr. Imam, who is about 46, is accused of taking part in the attacks on the diplomatic compound and the C.I.A. base, according to prosecutors. He is charged in a criminal complaint with killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility involving the use of a firearm and dangerous weapon; conspiring to provide material support to terrorists resulting in death; and possession of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.

To capture Mr. Khattala, an F.B.I. agent and several Delta Force operators snatched him from a beachside villa on Libya’s coast, and Navy SEALs took him to a waiting warship, where he was interrogated. In another operation, Delta Force commandos and the F.B.I. captured an Al Qaeda suspect in 2013 as he returned home from morning prayers. He was taken to an American warship and had to be quickly flown to the United States because of serious health problems. He later died of liver cancer before he could stand trial.",Benghazi Attacks Suspect Is Captured in Libya by U.S. Commandos,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/africa/benghazi-attacks-second-suspect-captured.html

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

The company said it planned to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.","The Russia-linked posts were “an insidious attempt to drive people apart,” Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook who will appear at the hearings, said in his prepared remarks. He called the posts “deeply disturbing,” and noted they focused on race, religion, gun rights, and gay and transgender issues, in attempts to spread discord among Americans.

Facebook, Mr. Stretch said, was “determined to prevent it from happening again.”

The new information also illuminated when Facebook knew that there had been Russian interference on its platform. Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations.

Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users’ News Feeds everyday. Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook.

Google, in a prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria. This replicated the efforts found on Twitter and Facebook to foment societal division with hot-button topics.

Google said it had found 18 channels that were “likely associated” with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube. All told, those accounts — now suspended — uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017. Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts; only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers.

The internet search giant also confirmed earlier reports that the Internet Research Agency had purchased search and display ads from it. Google said the group had bought $4,700 in ads but none of them had targeted users by their political leanings, which was a targeting tool that Google added before the election.

Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those had not been related to the Kremlin.

“While we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable,” wrote Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel. The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.

For Facebook and Google, the discovery of Russian influence by way of their sites has been a rude awakening. The companies had long positioned themselves as spreading information and connecting people for positive ends. Now the companies must grapple with how Russian agents used their technologies exactly as they were meant to be used — but for malevolent purposes.

That has led to thorny debates inside the companies. For Facebook, the problem is less straightforward than finding Russia-linked pages and taking down content. Executives worry about how stifling speech from non-American entities could set a precedent on the social network — and how it could potentially be used against other groups in the future.

So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity — or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such — as a reason for taking down the accounts.

“Many of these ads did not violate our content policies,” Elliot Schrage, vice president of policy and communications at Facebook, said in a company blog post earlier this month. “That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.”

Earlier this month, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner introduced a bipartisan bill to require internet companies to identify those who paid for political ads on the tech companies’ platforms.

Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill. Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network.

The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures. Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate. The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year.

Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads. The company said it planned to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.

The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Google’s AdWords — for example, web search ads — and YouTube. Google also said it will identify the advertisers paying for political advertisements within a link accessible from the ad.

But Google said it planned on taking no further action against state-backed Russian news channel RT, which has built a massive online audience through YouTube. The American intelligence community has described RT as the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet”, but Google said the organization had not violated any of its policies or misused the service.

Last week, by contrast, Twitter said it would ban RT and Sputnik, another Kremlin-backed news organization, from advertising on its service.",Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html
